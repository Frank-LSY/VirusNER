Lymphoepithelial-like
carcinomas
(
LELC
)
head
neck
represent
malignant
neoplasms
histologically
similar
nasopharyngeal
carcinoma
(
NPC
)
,
nonkeratinizing
undifferentiated
type
arise
locations
nasopharynx
.

The
common
location
LELC
head
neck
salivary
glands
,
particular
parotid
gland
.

However
,
LELC
may
arise
sites
including
oropharynx
(
tonsils
,
base
tongue
)
,
sinonasal
tract
,
larynx
,
middle
ear/temporal

,
LELCs
uniformly
associated
EBV
.

The
differential
diagnosis
LELC
varies
per
site
depending
site
occurrence
may
include

Treatment
general
includes
combined
(
multimodality
)
therapy
including
