Human
papillomaviruses
(
HPV
)
require
activation
DNA
damage
response
(
DDR
)
order
undergo
successful
life
cycle
.

This
activation
presents
challenge
virus
infected
cell
:
viral
host
replication
proceed
presence
DDR
ordinarily
arrests
replication
;
HPV16
infected
cells
retain
ability
proliferate
presence
DDR
ordinarily
arrests
cell
cycle
?

This
raises
question
:
HPV
activate
DDR
?

The
answers
questions
partially
understood
;
full
understanding
could
identify
novel
therapeutic
strategies
target
HPV
cancers
.

Here
,
propose
rapid
replication
8
kb
double
stranded
circular
genome
infection
creates
aberrant
DNA
structures
attract
activate
DDR
proteins
.

Therefore
,
HPV
replication
presence
active
DDR
necessity
successful
viral
life
cycle
order
resolve
DNA
structures
viral
genomes
;
without
active
DDR
,
successful
replication
viral
genome
would
proceed
.

We
