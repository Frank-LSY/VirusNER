At physiological temperatures, the receptor catalyzes anirreversible expansion of the virus to form an expanded form of the capsid calledthe 135S particle. This expansion results in the externalization of themyristoylated capsid protein VP4 and the N-terminal extension of the capsidprotein VP1, both of which become inserted into the cell membrane. Structures of the expanded forms of poliovirus and of several related viruses have recentlybeen reported. However, until now, it has been unclear how receptor bindingtriggers viral expansion at physiological temperature. Here, we report poliovirusin complex with an enzymatically partially deglycosylated form of the 3-domainectodomain of Pvr at a 4-Å resolution, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy.The interaction of the receptor with the virus in this structure is reminiscentof the interactions of Pvr with its natural ligands. At a low temperature, thereceptor induces very few changes in the structure of the virus, with the largestchanges occurring within the footprint of the receptor, and in a loop of theinternal protein VP4. Changes in the vicinity of the receptor include thedisplacement of a natural lipid ligand (called "pocket factor"), demonstratingthat the loss of this ligand, alone, is not sufficient to induce particleexpansion. Finally, analogies with naturally occurring ligand binding in thenectin family suggest which specific structural rearrangements in thevirus-receptor complex could help to trigger the irreversible expansion of thecapsid.IMPORTANCE: The cell-surface receptor (Pvr) catalyzes a large structuralchange in the virus that exposes membrane-binding protein chains. We fitted knownatomic models of the virus and Pvr into three-dimensional experimental maps ofthe receptor-virus complex. The molecular interactions we see between poliovirus and its receptor are reminiscent of the nectin family, by involving the buryingof otherwise-exposed hydrophobic groups. Importantly, poliovirus expansion isregulated by the binding of a lipid molecule within the viral capsid. We showthat receptor binding either causes this molecule to be expelled or requires it, but that its loss is not sufficient to trigger irreversible expansion. Based onour model, we propose testable hypotheses to explain how the viral shell becomes destabilized, leading to RNA uncoating. These findings give us a betterunderstanding of how poliovirus has evolved to exploit a natural process of itshost to penetrate the membrane barrier.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.
