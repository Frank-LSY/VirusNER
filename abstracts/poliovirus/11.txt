Sanger-based sequencing of the viral protein 1 (VP1) capsid regionis currently the standard method for PV surveillance. However, the whole-genomesequence is sometimes needed for higher resolution global surveillance. In thisstudy, we optimized whole-genome sequencing protocols for poliovirus isolates andFTA cards using next-generation sequencing (NGS), aiming for high sequencecoverage, efficiency, and throughput. We found that DNase treatment of poliovirusRNA followed by random reverse transcription (RT), amplification, and the use of the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit produced significantly better results than other preparations. The average viral reads per total reads, a measurementof efficiency, was as high as 84.2% ± 15.6%. PV genomes covering >99 to 100% ofthe reference length were obtained and validated with Sanger sequencing. A total of 52 PV genomes were generated, multiplexing as many as 64 samples in a singleIllumina MiSeq run. This high-throughput, sequence-independent NGS approachfacilitated the detection of a diverse range of PVs, especially for those invaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV), circulating VDPV, orimmunodeficiency-related VDPV. In contrast to results from previous studies onother viruses, our results showed that filtration and nuclease treatment did not discernibly increase the sequencing efficiency of PV isolates. However, DNasetreatment after nucleic acid extraction to remove host DNA significantly improvedthe sequencing results. This NGS method has been successfully implemented togenerate PV genomes for molecular epidemiology of the most recent PV isolates.Additionally, the ability to obtain full PV genomes from FTA cards will aid infacilitating global poliovirus surveillance.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.DOI: 10.1128/JCM.02121-16 PMCID: PMC5277531PMID: 27927929  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
