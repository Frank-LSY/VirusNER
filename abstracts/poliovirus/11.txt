The poliovirus (PV) is currently targeted for worldwide eradication and
containment. Sanger-based sequencing of the viral protein 1 (VP1) capsid region
is currently the standard method for PV surveillance. However, the whole-genome
sequence is sometimes needed for higher resolution global surveillance. In this
study, we optimized whole-genome sequencing protocols for poliovirus isolates and
FTA cards using next-generation sequencing (NGS), aiming for high sequence
coverage, efficiency, and throughput. We found that DNase treatment of poliovirus
RNA followed by random reverse transcription (RT), amplification, and the use of 
the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit produced significantly better results 
than other preparations. The average viral reads per total reads, a measurement
of efficiency, was as high as 84.2% ± 15.6%. PV genomes covering >99 to 100% of
the reference length were obtained and validated with Sanger sequencing. A total 
of 52 PV genomes were generated, multiplexing as many as 64 samples in a single
Illumina MiSeq run. This high-throughput, sequence-independent NGS approach
facilitated the detection of a diverse range of PVs, especially for those in
vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV), circulating VDPV, or
immunodeficiency-related VDPV. In contrast to results from previous studies on
other viruses, our results showed that filtration and nuclease treatment did not 
discernibly increase the sequencing efficiency of PV isolates. However, DNase
treatment after nucleic acid extraction to remove host DNA significantly improved
the sequencing results. This NGS method has been successfully implemented to
generate PV genomes for molecular epidemiology of the most recent PV isolates.
Additionally, the ability to obtain full PV genomes from FTA cards will aid in
facilitating global poliovirus surveillance.
