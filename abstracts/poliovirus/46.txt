Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Jan 4;97(1):79-84.Interaction of the poliovirus receptor with poliovirus.He Y(1), Bowman VD, Mueller S, Bator CM, Bella J, Peng X, Baker TS, Wimmer E,Kuhn RJ, Rossmann MG.Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN47907-1392, USA.The structure of the extracellular, three-domain poliovirus receptor (CD155)complexed with poliovirus (serotype 1) has been determined to 22-A resolution by means of cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image-reconstructiontechniques. Density corresponding to the receptor was isolated in a differenceelectron density map and fitted with known structures, homologous to those of thethree individual CD155 Ig-like domains. The fit was confirmed by the location of carbohydrate moieties in the CD155 glycoprotein, the conserved properties ofelbow angles in the structures of cell surface molecules with Ig-like folds, and the concordance with prior results of CD155 and poliovirus mutagenesis. CD155binds in the poliovirus "canyon" and has a footprint similar to that of theintercellular adhesion molecule-1 receptor on human rhinoviruses. However, theorientation of the long, slender CD155 molecule relative to the poliovirussurface is quite different from the orientation of intercellular adhesionmolecule-1 on rhinoviruses. In addition, the residues that provide specificity ofrecognition differ for the two receptors. The principal feature of receptorbinding common to these two picornaviruses is the site in the canyon at whichbinding occurs. This site may be a trigger for initiation of the subsequentuncoating step required for viral infection.PMCID: PMC26619PMID: 10618374  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
