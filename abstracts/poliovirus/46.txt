The structure of the extracellular, three-domain poliovirus receptor (CD155)
complexed with poliovirus (serotype 1) has been determined to 22-A resolution by 
means of cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image-reconstruction
techniques. Density corresponding to the receptor was isolated in a difference
electron density map and fitted with known structures, homologous to those of the
three individual CD155 Ig-like domains. The fit was confirmed by the location of 
carbohydrate moieties in the CD155 glycoprotein, the conserved properties of
elbow angles in the structures of cell surface molecules with Ig-like folds, and 
the concordance with prior results of CD155 and poliovirus mutagenesis. CD155
binds in the poliovirus "canyon" and has a footprint similar to that of the
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 receptor on human rhinoviruses. However, the
orientation of the long, slender CD155 molecule relative to the poliovirus
surface is quite different from the orientation of intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 on rhinoviruses. In addition, the residues that provide specificity of
recognition differ for the two receptors. The principal feature of receptor
binding common to these two picornaviruses is the site in the canyon at which
binding occurs. This site may be a trigger for initiation of the subsequent
uncoating step required for viral infection.
