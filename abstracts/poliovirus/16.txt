Molecular methods have beenused to detect polioviruses in tissue culture isolates derived from stool samplesobtained through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis. This chapter describesthe use of realtime PCR assays to identify and serotype polioviruses. Inparticular, a degenerate, inosine-containing, panpoliovirus (panPV) PCR primerset is used to distinguish polioviruses from NPEVs. The high degree of nucleotidesequence diversity among polioviruses presents a challenge to the systematicdesign of nucleic acid-based reagents. To accommodate the wide variability andrapid evolution of poliovirus genomes, degenerate codon positions on the templatewere matched to mixed-base or deoxyinosine residues on both the primers and theTaqManâ„¢ probes. Additional assays distinguish between Sabin vaccine strains andnon-Sabin strains. This chapter also describes the use of generic poliovirusspecific primers, along with degenerate and inosine-containing primers, forroutine VP1 sequencing of poliovirus isolates. These primers, along withnondegenerate serotype-specific Sabin primers, can also be used to sequenceindividual polioviruses in mixtures.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3292-4_9 PMID: 26983735  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
