Bing Du Xue Bao. 2016 Jul;32(4):459-64.[Complete Genome Characterization of Vaccine-derived Polioviruses Isolated inYunnan,China].[Article in Chinese]Tang J, Zhang J, Li K, Tian B, Zhao Z, Ding Z.To explore the genomic characterization of 4vaccine-derivedpoliovirus(VDPV)strains isolated from 2acute flaccid paralysis(AFP)cases inYunnan Province in 2010 and 2012,respectively,the complete genome sequences ofthe 4strains were determined. Sequence analysis revealed that the complete genomelength of the type Ⅱ and type Ⅰ VDPV was 7439nt and 7441 nt, respectively.Nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities of type II VDPV were 95.4% and97.7%,respectively,and type I VDPV were93.9% and 97.9%,respectively as comparedwith those of Sabin strains. Nucleotide substitutions were found at two importantattenuation sites (nt 481 and nt in type Ⅱ VDPV, and three important attenuation sites(nt480,nt2795 and nt6203)in type I VDPV. Type 2 and type 1VDPV strains had1.0% and2.3% divergence with Sabin strains, respectively. Similarity plotanalysis showed multiple recombination events in the genome of the 4strains,whichshowed that the recombination was common and complex. Analysis of thecharacteristics of VDPVs on molecular level could provide valuable information onevolutionary dynamics and lay foundation for developing scientific and feasiblestrategy to control VDPV.PMID: 29981280  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
