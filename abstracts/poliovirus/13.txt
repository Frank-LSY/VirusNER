To explore the genomic characterization of 4vaccine-derived
poliovirus(VDPV)strains isolated from 2acute flaccid paralysis(AFP)cases in
Yunnan Province in 2010 and 2012,respectively,the complete genome sequences of
the 4strains were determined. Sequence analysis revealed that the complete genome
length of the type Ⅱ and type Ⅰ VDPV was 7439nt and 7441 nt, respectively.
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities of type II VDPV were 95.4% and
97.7%,respectively,and type I VDPV were93.9% and 97.9%,respectively as compared
with those of Sabin strains. Nucleotide substitutions were found at two important
attenuation sites (nt 481 and nt in type Ⅱ VDPV, and three important attenuation 
sites(nt480,nt2795 and nt6203)in type I VDPV. Type 2 and type 1VDPV strains had
1.0% and2.3% divergence with Sabin strains, respectively. Similarity plot
analysis showed multiple recombination events in the genome of the 4strains,which
showed that the recombination was common and complex. Analysis of the
characteristics of VDPVs on molecular level could provide valuable information on
evolutionary dynamics and lay foundation for developing scientific and feasible
strategy to control VDPV.
