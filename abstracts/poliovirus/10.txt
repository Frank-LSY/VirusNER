MBio. 2017 Aug 8;8(4):null.The plaque assay is a common technique used to measure virus concentrations andis based upon the principle that each plaque represents a single infectious unit.As such, the number of plaques is expected to correlate linearly with the virusdilution plated, and each plaque should be formed by a single founder virus.Here, we examined whether more than one virus can contribute to plaque formation.By using genetic and phenotypic assays with genetically marked polioviruses, wefound that multiple parental viruses are present in 5 to 7% of plaques, even atan extremely low multiplicity of infection. We demonstrated through visual andbiophysical assays that, like many viral stocks, our viral stocks contain bothsingle particles and aggregates. These data suggest that aggregated virions arecapable of inducing coinfection and chimeric plaque formation. In fact, inducing virion aggregation via exposure to low pH increased coinfection in a flowcytometry-based assay. We hypothesized that plaques generated by viruses withhigh mutation loads may have higher coinfection frequencies due to processesrestoring fitness, such as complementation and recombination. Indeed, we foundthat coinfection frequency correlated with mutation load, with 17% chimericplaque formation for heavily mutagenized viruses. Importantly, the frequency ofchimeric plaques may be underestimated by up to threefold, since coinfection withthe same parental virus cannot be scored in our assay. This work indicates thatmore than one virus can contribute to plaque formation and that coinfection mayassist plaque formation in situations where the amount of genome damage ishigh.IMPORTANCE One of the most common methods to quantify viruses is the plaque assay, where it is generally presumed that each plaque represents a singleinfectious virus. Using genetically marked polioviruses, we demonstrate that aplaque can contain more than one parental virus, likely due to aggregates within virus stocks that induce coinfection of a cell. A relatively small number ofplaques are the products of coinfection for our standard virus stocks. However,mutagenized virus stocks with increased genome damage give rise to a higheramount of plaques that are chimeric. These results suggest that coinfection mayaid plaque formation of viruses with genome damage, possibly due to processessuch as complementation and recombination. Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between viral dilution and plaque number may not be linear,particularly for mutagenized viral populations.Copyright Â© 2017 Aguilera et al.DOI: 10.1128/mBio.02020-16 PMCID: PMC5350468PMID: 28292984  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
