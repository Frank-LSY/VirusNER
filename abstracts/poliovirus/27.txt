Nineteen cases were virologically confirmed as due towild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), and 26 were classified as polio compatible. Elevendeaths occurred among confirmed and compatible cases (24%). Of the confirmedcases, 97% were aged 15-45 years, 89% were male, and 71% lived in settlementareas in Windhoek. The virus was genetically related to a virus detected in 2005 in Angola, which had been imported earlier from India. The outbreak is likely dueto immunity gaps among adults who were inadequately vaccinated during childhood. This outbreak underscores the ongoing risks posed by poliovirus importations, theimportance of maintaining strong acute flaccid paralysis surveillance even inadults, and the need to maintain high population immunity to avoid poliooutbreaks in the preeradication period and outbreaks due to vaccine-derivedpolioviruses in the posteradication era.Â© The Author 2014.
