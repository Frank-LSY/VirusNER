Electronic address: grome001@mc.duke.edu.An oncolytic virus (OV) based on poliovirus (PV), the highly attenuatedpolio/rhinovirus recombinant PVSRIPO, may deliver targeted inflammatory cancercell killing; a principle that is showing promise in clinical trials forrecurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The two decisive factors in PVSRIPO anti-tumorefficacy are selective cytotoxicity and its in situ immunogenic imprint. Whileour work is focused on what constitutes PVSRIPO cancer cytotoxicity, we are also studying how this engenders host immune responses that are vital to tumorregression. We hypothesize that PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and immunogenicity areinextricably linked in essential, complimentary roles that define theanti-neoplastic response. Herein we delineate mechanisms we unraveled to decipherthe basis for PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and its immunotherapeutic potential.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
