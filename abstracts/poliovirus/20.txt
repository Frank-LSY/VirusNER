An oncolytic virus (OV) based on poliovirus (PV), the highly attenuated
polio/rhinovirus recombinant PVSRIPO, may deliver targeted inflammatory cancer
cell killing; a principle that is showing promise in clinical trials for
recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The two decisive factors in PVSRIPO anti-tumor
efficacy are selective cytotoxicity and its in situ immunogenic imprint. While
our work is focused on what constitutes PVSRIPO cancer cytotoxicity, we are also 
studying how this engenders host immune responses that are vital to tumor
regression. We hypothesize that PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are
inextricably linked in essential, complimentary roles that define the
anti-neoplastic response. Herein we delineate mechanisms we unraveled to decipher
the basis for PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and its immunotherapeutic potential.
