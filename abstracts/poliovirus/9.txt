Spontaneous reversion to neurovirulence of live attenuated oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV) serotype 3 (chiefly involving the n.472U>C mutation), must be
monitored during production to ensure vaccine safety and consistency. Mutant
analysis by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC)
has long been endorsed by the World Health Organization as the preferred in vitro
test for this purpose; however, it requires radiolabeling, which is no longer
supported by many laboratories. We evaluated the performance and suitability of
next generation sequencing (NGS) as an alternative to MAPREC. The linearity of
NGS was demonstrated at revertant concentrations equivalent to the study range of
0.25%-1.5%. NGS repeatability and intermediate precision were comparable across
all tested samples, and NGS was highly reproducible, irrespective of sequencing
platform or analysis software used. NGS was performed on OPV serotype 3 working
seed lots and monovalent bulks (n=21) that were previously tested using MAPREC,
and which covered the representative range of vaccine production. Percentages of 
472-C revertants identified by NGS and MAPREC were comparable and highly
correlated (r≥0.80), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95585
(p<0.0001). NGS demonstrated statistically equivalent performance to that of
MAPREC for quantifying low-frequency OPV serotype 3 revertants, and offers a
valid alternative to MAPREC.
