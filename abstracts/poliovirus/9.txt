Electronicaddress: Laurent.Mallet@sanofi.com.Spontaneous reversion to neurovirulence of live attenuated oral poliovirusvaccine (OPV) serotype 3 (chiefly involving the n.472U>C mutation), must bemonitored during production to ensure vaccine safety and consistency. Mutantanalysis by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC)has long been endorsed by the World Health Organization as the preferred in vitrotest for this purpose; however, it requires radiolabeling, which is no longersupported by many laboratories. We evaluated the performance and suitability ofnext generation sequencing (NGS) as an alternative to MAPREC. The linearity ofNGS was demonstrated at revertant concentrations equivalent to the study range of0.25%-1.5%. NGS repeatability and intermediate precision were comparable acrossall tested samples, and NGS was highly reproducible, irrespective of sequencingplatform or analysis software used. NGS was performed on OPV serotype 3 workingseed lots and monovalent bulks (n=21) that were previously tested using MAPREC,and which covered the representative range of vaccine production. Percentages of 472-C revertants identified by NGS and MAPREC were comparable and highlycorrelated (r≥0.80), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95585(p<0.0001). NGS demonstrated statistically equivalent performance to that ofMAPREC for quantifying low-frequency OPV serotype 3 revertants, and offers avalid alternative to MAPREC.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
