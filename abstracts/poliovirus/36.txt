In order to perform environmental surveillance to track oral poliovirus
vaccine-like poliovirus sensitively and conveniently, real-time PCR was developed
and applied to a raw sewage concentrate. The real-time PCR method detected
0.01-0.1 TCID50 of 3 serotypes of Sabin strain specifically. The method also
detected the corresponding serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine-like poliovirus
specifically, but detected neither wild poliovirus, except Mahoney for type 1 and
Saukett for type 3, nor other enteric viruses, as far as examined. When real-time
PCR was applied to environmental surveillance, the overall agreement rates
between real-time PCR and the cell culture were 83.3% for all serotypes. Since
real-time PCR has the advantages of rapid detection of viruses and minimum
requirement of sampling volume as compared with ordinary cell culture, it is
suitable to monitor oral poliovirus vaccine-like poliovirus in the environment,
especially in areas where an oral vaccine is being replaced by an inactivated
vaccine.
