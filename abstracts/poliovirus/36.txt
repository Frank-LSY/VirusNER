The real-time PCR method detected0.01-0.1 TCID50 of 3 serotypes of Sabin strain specifically. The method alsodetected the corresponding serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine-like poliovirusspecifically, but detected neither wild poliovirus, except Mahoney for type 1 andSaukett for type 3, nor other enteric viruses, as far as examined. When real-timePCR was applied to environmental surveillance, the overall agreement ratesbetween real-time PCR and the cell culture were 83.3% for all serotypes. Sincereal-time PCR has the advantages of rapid detection of viruses and minimumrequirement of sampling volume as compared with ordinary cell culture, it issuitable to monitor oral poliovirus vaccine-like poliovirus in the environment,especially in areas where an oral vaccine is being replaced by an inactivatedvaccine.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
