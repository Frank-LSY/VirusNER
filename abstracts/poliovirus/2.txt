It is involved in RNA replication, encapsidation and uncoating and manyinhibitors have been found that target PV 2CATPase. Despite numerousinvestigations to characterize its functions, a high-resolution structure of PV2C has not yet been determined. We report here the crystal structure of a solublefragment of PV 2CATPase to 2.55Ã…, containing an ATPase domain, a zinc finger and a C-terminal helical domain but missing the N-terminal domain. The ATPase domain shares the common structural features with EV71 2C and other Superfamily 3helicases. The C-terminal cysteine-rich motif folds into a CCCC type zinc finger in which four cysteine ligands and several auxiliary residues assist in zincbinding. By comparing with the known zinc finger fold groups, we found the zincfinger of 2C proteins belong to a new fold group, which we denote the"Enterovirus 2C-like" group. The C-terminus of PV 2CATPase forms an amphipathichelix that occupies a hydrophobic pocket located on an adjacent PV 2CATPase inthe crystal lattice. The C-terminus mediated PV 2C-2C interaction promotesself-oligomerization, most likely hexamerization, which is fundamental to theATPase activity of 2C. The zinc finger is the most structurally diverse featurein 2C proteins. Available structural and virological data suggest that the zincfinger of 2C might confer the specificity of interaction with other proteins. We built a hexameric ring model of PV 2CATPase and visualized the previouslyidentified functional motifs and drug-resistant sites, thus providing a structureframework for antiviral drug development.DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007304 PMCID: PMC6166989PMID: 30231078  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
