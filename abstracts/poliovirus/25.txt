In populations with lowvaccine coverage, the live-attenuated Sabin strains, OPV types 1, 2 and 3, canevolve into virulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) and circulate in thecommunity. Until recently, circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) had not been reported inCameroon despite the fact that VDPV2 outbreaks have occurred in nearby countries.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize virus isolates from four AFPpatients infected with cVDPV2 in the Extreme North region of Cameroon in 2013.STUDY DESIGN: The complete VP1 region of the four VDPV strains was sequenced and the relationships with cVDPVs from neighboring countries were investigated.RESULTS: All four patients were infected by cVDPV2 strains showing 1.2-2.0%nucleotide difference compared to the reference Sabin 2 VP1 sequence.Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the VDPV strains were genetically linked to cVDPV2 lineages of the recent Chad cVDPV2 outbreak.CONCLUSIONS: The circulation of pathogenic VDPVs suggests that there arelocalized immunization gaps in some districts like Makary, Mada and Kolofata inCameroon. To avoid poliomyelitis outbreaks in Cameroon, especially in thedistricts close to neighboring countries with ongoing cVDPV outbreaks, high poliovaccine coverage is essential.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
