BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) poliovirus eradication program
includes careful surveillance of acute-flaccid paralysis (AFP) and mass and
routine immunization with oral polio vaccine (OPV). In populations with low
vaccine coverage, the live-attenuated Sabin strains, OPV types 1, 2 and 3, can
evolve into virulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) and circulate in the
community. Until recently, circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) had not been reported in
Cameroon despite the fact that VDPV2 outbreaks have occurred in nearby countries.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize virus isolates from four AFP
patients infected with cVDPV2 in the Extreme North region of Cameroon in 2013.
STUDY DESIGN: The complete VP1 region of the four VDPV strains was sequenced and 
the relationships with cVDPVs from neighboring countries were investigated.
RESULTS: All four patients were infected by cVDPV2 strains showing 1.2-2.0%
nucleotide difference compared to the reference Sabin 2 VP1 sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the VDPV strains were genetically linked to 
cVDPV2 lineages of the recent Chad cVDPV2 outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: The circulation of pathogenic VDPVs suggests that there are
localized immunization gaps in some districts like Makary, Mada and Kolofata in
Cameroon. To avoid poliomyelitis outbreaks in Cameroon, especially in the
districts close to neighboring countries with ongoing cVDPV outbreaks, high polio
vaccine coverage is essential.
