Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses - Worldwide, January 2017-June 2018.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988 (1), the
number of polio cases worldwide has declined by >99.99%. Among the three wild
poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. This
decline is attributable primarily to use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus 
vaccine (OPV) in national routine immunization schedules and mass vaccination
campaigns. The success and safety record of OPV use is offset by the rare
emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), whose
genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or
circulation (2). Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) can emerge in areas with low
immunization coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. In addition,
immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can emerge in persons with primary
immunodeficiencies and can replicate and be excreted for years. This report
presents data on VDPVs detected during January 2017-June 2018 and updates
previous VDPV summaries (3). During this reporting period, new cVDPV outbreaks
were detected in five countries. Fourteen newly identified persons in nine
countries were found to excrete iVDPVs. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that
cannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and
environmental samples in seven countries.
