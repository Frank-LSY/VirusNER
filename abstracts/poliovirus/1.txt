Among the three wildpoliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. Thisdecline is attributable primarily to use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in national routine immunization schedules and mass vaccinationcampaigns. The success and safety record of OPV use is offset by the rareemergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), whosegenetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication orcirculation (2). Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) can emerge in areas with lowimmunization coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. In addition,immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can emerge in persons with primaryimmunodeficiencies and can replicate and be excreted for years. This reportpresents data on VDPVs detected during January 2017-June 2018 and updatesprevious VDPV summaries (3). During this reporting period, new cVDPV outbreakswere detected in five countries. Fourteen newly identified persons in ninecountries were found to excrete iVDPVs. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates thatcannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons andenvironmental samples in seven countries.DOI: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6742a5 PMCID: PMC6290814PMID: 30359342  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
