Isolation and molecular analysis of polioviruses fromsewage specimens monitored the duration of vaccine-related strains in theenvironment and emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses in a populationpartially immunized with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).RESULTS: Sabin strains were identified up to 5-8 weeks after the campaign in all towns; in Aguascalientes, 1 Sabin 3 was isolated 16 weeks after the campaign,following 7 weeks with no Sabin strains detected. In Tuxtla Gutiérrez, type 2VDPV was isolated from 4 samples collected before and during the campaign, andtype 1 VDPV from 1 sample collected 19 weeks afterward. During 2009-2010,coverage in 4 OPV campaigns conducted averaged only 57% and surveillance foracute flaccid paralysis (AFP) was suboptimal (AFP rate<1 per 100,000population<15 years of age) in Tuxtla Gutierrez.CONCLUSIONS: VDPVs may emerge and spread in settings with inadequate coveragewith IPV/OPV vaccination. Environmental surveillance can facilitate earlydetection in these settings.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Societyof America 2014.
