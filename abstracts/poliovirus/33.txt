Infection by PV is initiated by virus binding to specific cellreceptors, which results in viral particles undergoing sequential conformational changes that generate altered structural forms (135S and 80S particles) and leadsto virus cell entry. We have analyzed the ability of inactivated PV to bind tothe human poliovirus receptor (hPVR) using various techniques such asultracentrifugation, fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry andreal-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The results showed that althoughretaining the ability to bind to hPVR, inactivated PV bound less efficiently incomparison to live PV. We also found that inactivated PV showed resistance tostructural conversion in vitro, as judged by measuring changes in antigenicity,the ability to bind to hPVR, and viral RNA release at high temperature.Furthermore, viral RNA from inactivated PV was shown to be modified, since cDNAyields obtained by RT-PCR amplification were severely reduced and no infectiousvirus was recovered after RNA transfection into susceptible cells. Importance:This study represents a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms responsiblefor poliovirus inactivation. We show that inactivation with formaldehyde has aneffect on early steps of viral replication as it reduces the ability of PV tobind to hPVR, decreases the sensitivity of PV to convert to 135S particles, andabolishes the infectivity of its viral RNA. These changes are likely responsible for the loss of infectivity shown by PV following inactivation. Techniques usedin this study represent new approaches for the characterization of inactivated PVproducts and could be useful in developing improved methods for the productionand quality control testing of inactivated polio vaccines. Measuring theantigenicity, capsid stability, and RNA integrity of inactivated PV samples couldhelp establishing the optimal balance between the loss of infectivity and thepreservation of virus antigenicity during inactivation.Copyright Â© 2014, American Society for Microbiology.
