We describe the first synthesis of a virus (poliovirus) in 2002 thatwas accomplished outside living cells. We comment on the reaction of laypeopleand scientists to the work, which shaped the response to de novo syntheses ofother viruses. We discuss those viruses that have been synthesized since 2002,among them viruses whose precise genome sequence had to be established bypainstakingly stitching together pieces of sequence information, and virusesinvolved in zoonosis. Synthesizing viral genomes provides a powerful tool forstudying gene function and the pathogenic potential of these organisms. It alsoallows modification of viral genomes to an extent hitherto unthinkable. Recoding of poliovirus and influenza virus to develop new vaccine candidates andrefactoring the phage T7 DNA genome are discussed as examples.DOI: 10.1146/annurev-micro-090110-102957 PMID: 21756105  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
