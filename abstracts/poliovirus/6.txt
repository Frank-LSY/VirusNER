Electronic address: czq@wh.iov.cn.In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a highlyevolved type 3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) strain designated as WIV14,isolated in 2014 from a 4-year-old child suspected of having an enteroviralinfection in China. Complete genome sequence of WIV14 revealed multiplenucleotide substitutions when compared with the attenuated poliovirus (PV) Sabin 3, including the reversion of three major attenuation sites to wild type. Fromthe nucleotide divergence for the P1/capsid region, we estimated that theevolution time of WIV14 was more than 7 years, indicating the possible long time of replication. WIV14 strain seemed to have differences in biologicalcharacteristics compared with attenuated PV strains, such as beingnon-temperature-sensitive and producing large plaques. The current isolation of ahighly divergent type 3 VDPV gives an idea of the risk of emergent VDPV strains, and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and herdimmunity against PVs in China.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.
