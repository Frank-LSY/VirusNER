In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a highly
evolved type 3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) strain designated as WIV14,
isolated in 2014 from a 4-year-old child suspected of having an enteroviral
infection in China. Complete genome sequence of WIV14 revealed multiple
nucleotide substitutions when compared with the attenuated poliovirus (PV) Sabin 
3, including the reversion of three major attenuation sites to wild type. From
the nucleotide divergence for the P1/capsid region, we estimated that the
evolution time of WIV14 was more than 7 years, indicating the possible long time 
of replication. WIV14 strain seemed to have differences in biological
characteristics compared with attenuated PV strains, such as being
non-temperature-sensitive and producing large plaques. The current isolation of a
highly divergent type 3 VDPV gives an idea of the risk of emergent VDPV strains, 
and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and herd
immunity against PVs in China.
