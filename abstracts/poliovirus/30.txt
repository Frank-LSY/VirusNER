The attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has many properties favoring its use
in polio eradication: ease of administration, efficient induction of intestinal
immunity, induction of durable humoral immunity, and low cost. Despite these
advantages, OPV has the disadvantage of genetic instability, resulting in rare
and sporadic cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and the
emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Whereas 
VAPP is an adverse event following exposure to OPV, VDPVs are polioviruses whose 
genetic properties indicate prolonged replication or transmission. Three
categories of VDPVs are recognized: (1) circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) from outbreaks
in settings of low OPV coverage, (2) immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs)
from individuals with primary immunodeficiencies, and (3) ambiguous VDPVs
(aVDPVs), which cannot be definitively assigned to either of the first 2
categories. Because most VDPVs are type 2, the World Health Organization's plans 
call for coordinated worldwide replacement of trivalent OPV with bivalent OPV
containing poliovirus types 1 and 3.
