48. Biologicals. 1993 Dec;21(4):305-9.The discovery of the enteroviruses and the classification of poliovirus amongthem.Melnick JL(1).Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.The history of the enteroviruses is described, and how poliovirus came to berecognized as the prototype species of the genus, a subdivision of the familyPicornaviridae. Albert Sabin was one of the main contributors. He isolatedseveral enterovirus types and established them as causative agents of humandisease. The enteroviruses were discovered only after new methods were introducedfor working with viruses. They are now recognized as constituting one of thegenera of the picornavirus family. Pico-rna-virus stands for viruses which aresmall (pico), and have an RNA genome. The enterovirus genus includes thepolioviruses, the coxsackieviruses and the echoviruses of humans, plus a numberof enteroviruses of lower animals (e.g., monkeys, cattle, pigs, mice). Over 100serotypes are now recognized, the first having been the polioviruses.DOI: 10.1006/biol.1993.1088 PMID: 8024744  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
