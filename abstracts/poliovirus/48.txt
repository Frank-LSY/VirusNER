The history of the enteroviruses is described, and how poliovirus came to be
recognized as the prototype species of the genus, a subdivision of the family
Picornaviridae. Albert Sabin was one of the main contributors. He isolated
several enterovirus types and established them as causative agents of human
disease. The enteroviruses were discovered only after new methods were introduced
for working with viruses. They are now recognized as constituting one of the
genera of the picornavirus family. Pico-rna-virus stands for viruses which are
small (pico), and have an RNA genome. The enterovirus genus includes the
polioviruses, the coxsackieviruses and the echoviruses of humans, plus a number
of enteroviruses of lower animals (e.g., monkeys, cattle, pigs, mice). Over 100
serotypes are now recognized, the first having been the polioviruses.
