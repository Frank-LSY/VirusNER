The analyses were performed for the detection ofany putative polio revertants and recombinants in three genomic regions bysequencing analysis. Thirty-six strains were analyzed. The analyzed strains were identified by neutralization assay as 7 strains of serotype P1, 10 strains ofserotype P2, and 19 strains of serotype P3. Sewage isolates were sequenced in5'UTR, VP1, and 3D genomic regions. All detected PVs were classified as vaccinestrains on the basis of VP1 sequence. Mutational differences in the VP1 sequencesof isolated viruses ranged from 0.0% to 0.4%, indicating a limited replicationperiod. The genetic analysis of the 3D region showed that some strains haverecombinant genomes. Nine strains were found as dipartite recombinants (sevenstrains--S3/S2, one strain--S2/S1, one strain--S3/S1), while one strain was foundas tripartite recombinant (S3/S2/S1). No recombinants with non-PV enteroviruseswere identified. None of wild-type PVs or vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs)were detected. This study showed the absence of wild or VDPV circulation in thecountry and demonstrated the usefulness of environmental surveillance in additionto acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in support of polio eradicationinitiatives.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jmv.23803 PMID: 24123142  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
