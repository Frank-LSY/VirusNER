The study describes genetic characterization of poliovirus (PV) strains isolated 
from sewage samples in Poland. The analyses were performed for the detection of
any putative polio revertants and recombinants in three genomic regions by
sequencing analysis. Thirty-six strains were analyzed. The analyzed strains were 
identified by neutralization assay as 7 strains of serotype P1, 10 strains of
serotype P2, and 19 strains of serotype P3. Sewage isolates were sequenced in
5'UTR, VP1, and 3D genomic regions. All detected PVs were classified as vaccine
strains on the basis of VP1 sequence. Mutational differences in the VP1 sequences
of isolated viruses ranged from 0.0% to 0.4%, indicating a limited replication
period. The genetic analysis of the 3D region showed that some strains have
recombinant genomes. Nine strains were found as dipartite recombinants (seven
strains--S3/S2, one strain--S2/S1, one strain--S3/S1), while one strain was found
as tripartite recombinant (S3/S2/S1). No recombinants with non-PV enteroviruses
were identified. None of wild-type PVs or vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs)
were detected. This study showed the absence of wild or VDPV circulation in the
country and demonstrated the usefulness of environmental surveillance in addition
to acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in support of polio eradication
initiatives.
