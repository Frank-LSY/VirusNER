Rapid identification and quantitation of polioviruses in clinical specimens is
important for surveillance and analysis of virus shedding by vaccine recipients, 
which could be used to assess the level of mucosal immunity. A quantitative one
step RT-PCR was developed for identification and titration of all three
poliovirus serotypes. The assay could be an alternative to the traditional
procedure based on cell culture isolation and subsequent determination of
poliovirus serotype and virus titration. The method is based on quantitative PCR 
performed with reverse transcription reaction in the same tube. The multiplex
assay that quantifies all three serotypes of poliovirus was found to be highly
specific, sensitive, and takes only one day to complete.
