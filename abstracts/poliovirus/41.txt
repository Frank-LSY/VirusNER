A quantitative onestep RT-PCR was developed for identification and titration of all threepoliovirus serotypes. The assay could be an alternative to the traditionalprocedure based on cell culture isolation and subsequent determination ofpoliovirus serotype and virus titration. The method is based on quantitative PCR performed with reverse transcription reaction in the same tube. The multiplexassay that quantifies all three serotypes of poliovirus was found to be highlyspecific, sensitive, and takes only one day to complete.Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.12.015 PMID: 23305817  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
