The matter has become pressing as type 2component of oral polio vaccine was completely withdrawn by May 2016 as wild ty[e2 was declared eradicated. Work on polioviruses must be contained in accordancewith GAPIII (the third version of the Global Action Plan of WHO). Some activitieswill be essential for years after eradication. Vaccine production and control,surveillance and supportive applied and academic research must all continue. Mostlaboratories do not currently comply with GAPIII and could not do so in the shortterm without disruption of essential activities including vaccine supply. Thedevelopment and use of safer strains is raised in GAPIII and the meetingconsidered the strains available and the uses to which they could be put tofacilitate compliance with the aims of GAPIII.Crown Copyright Â© 2017.
