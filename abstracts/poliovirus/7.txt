When poliomyelitis is totally eradicated from the natural world containment will 
be vital to prevent its re-emergence. The matter has become pressing as type 2
component of oral polio vaccine was completely withdrawn by May 2016 as wild ty[e
2 was declared eradicated. Work on polioviruses must be contained in accordance
with GAPIII (the third version of the Global Action Plan of WHO). Some activities
will be essential for years after eradication. Vaccine production and control,
surveillance and supportive applied and academic research must all continue. Most
laboratories do not currently comply with GAPIII and could not do so in the short
term without disruption of essential activities including vaccine supply. The
development and use of safer strains is raised in GAPIII and the meeting
considered the strains available and the uses to which they could be put to
facilitate compliance with the aims of GAPIII.
