The viruses of the OPV (oralpoliovirus attenuated-live vaccine) strains can mutate in the human intestineduring replication and some of these mutations can lead to the recovery ofserious neurovirulence. Informatics research of the poliovirus genome can be usedto explain further the characteristics of this virus. In this study, sequencesfrom 100 poliovirus isolates were acquired from GenBank. To determine theevolutionary relationship between the strains, we compared and analysed thesequences of the complete poliovirus genome and the VP1 region. The reconstructedphylogenetic trees for the complete sequences and the VP1 sequences were bothdivided into two branches, indicating that the genetic relationships of the wholepoliovirus genome and the VP1 sequences are very similar. This branchingindicates that the virulence and pathogenicity of poliomyelitis may be associatedwith the VP1 region. Sequence alignment of the VP1 region revealed numerousmutation sites in which mutation rates of >30 % were detected. In a group ofstrains recorded in the USA, mutation sites and mutation types were the same and this may be associated with their distribution in the evolutionary tree and theirgenetic relationship. In conclusion, the genetic evolutionary relationships ofpoliovirus isolate sequences are determined to a great extent by the VP1 protein,and poliovirus strains located on the same branch of the phylogenetic treecontain the same mutation spots and mutation types. Hence, the geneticcharacteristics of the VP1 region in the poliovirus genome should be analysed to identify the transmission route of poliovirus and provide the basis of viralimmunity development.© 2014 The Authors.DOI: 10.1099/jmm.0.081992-0 PMID: 25261065  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
