With multiple mechanisms for genetic variability,they are successful conformists, adapting to changes in their habitat. Theevolution of polioviruses may occur with generation of point mutations followedby genetic drift and selection. The mutation rate of polioviruses based onseveral studies is approximately 3 × 10(-2) mutations/synonymous site/year in thegene encoding viral protein 1. Genetic variation in polioviruses may also beincreased by sharing of genetic data of two different poliovirus lineages bymeans of homologous recombination. According to the current view, recombinationis considered usually to occur by strand-switching, but a non-replicative modelhas also been described. In recombination, polioviruses may either gain a set of advantageous mutations selected and fixed in previous generations of the parentalviruses or get rid of deleterious ones. The prerequisites and constraints of the evolution mechanisms will be discussed. Furthermore, consequences of poliovirusevolution will be reviewed in the light of observations made on currentlycirculating polioviruses. We will also describe how polioviruses strike back: as wild type polioviruses approach eradication, vaccine derived strains increasetheir occurrence and genetic variability.2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/rmv.663 PMID: 20949639  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
