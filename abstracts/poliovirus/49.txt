Bioessays. 1989 Nov;11(5):128-32.Poliovirus translation: a paradigm for a novel initiation mechanism.Sonenberg N, Pelletier J.All eukaryotic cellular mRNAs, and most viral mRNAs, are blocked at their 5' endswith a cap structure (m7GpppX, where X is any nucleotide). Poliovirus, along witha small number of other animal and plant viral mRNAs, does not contain a 5' capstructure. Since the cap structure functions to facilitate ribosome binding tomRNA, translation of polio-virus must proceed by a cap-independent mechanism.Consistent with this, recent studies have shown that ribosomes can bind to aninternal region within the long 5' noncoding sequence of poliovirus RNA. Possiblemechanisms for cap-independent translation are discussed. Cap-independenttranslation of poliovirus RNA is of major importance to the mechanism of shut-offof host protein synthesis after infection. Moreover, it is likely to play a role in determining poliovirus neurovirulence and attenuation.DOI: 10.1002/bies.950110504 PMID: 2556117  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
