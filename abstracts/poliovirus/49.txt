Poliovirus translation: a paradigm for a novel initiation mechanism.

Sonenberg N, Pelletier J.

All eukaryotic cellular mRNAs, and most viral mRNAs, are blocked at their 5' ends
with a cap structure (m7GpppX, where X is any nucleotide). Poliovirus, along with
a small number of other animal and plant viral mRNAs, does not contain a 5' cap
structure. Since the cap structure functions to facilitate ribosome binding to
mRNA, translation of polio-virus must proceed by a cap-independent mechanism.
Consistent with this, recent studies have shown that ribosomes can bind to an
internal region within the long 5' noncoding sequence of poliovirus RNA. Possible
mechanisms for cap-independent translation are discussed. Cap-independent
translation of poliovirus RNA is of major importance to the mechanism of shut-off
of host protein synthesis after infection. Moreover, it is likely to play a role 
in determining poliovirus neurovirulence and attenuation.
