Apart from insecurity and inaccessibilitychallenges, the substantial shift of unimmunized children from North Waziristandue to recent military operations was presumed to favor the widespread poliovirusinfection in Pakistan.METHODS: To better understand the current epidemiological situation, we analyzed the virologic data of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) strains detected in Pakistan during 2013-2015.RESULTS: Five genetic clusters (A-E) were identified with at least 5% nucleotide divergence in the viral protein 1 (VP1) coding region. Peshawar, Quetta, andKarachi were found to be the major endemic foci where multiple discrete geneticlineages of WPV1 were detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that wildpoliovirus strains from endemic regions were genetically distant (with 5%-15% VP1nucleotide divergence) from those detected in North Waziristan cases, excludingthe possibility of a recent progenitor of WPV1 instigating single-sourcetransmission across the country. Orphan lineages detected in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Jacobabad revealed silent transmission and the need forvigilant surveillance. Sustenance of analogous genetic lineages over a period of 3 years highlights multiple unimmunized foci present to maintain viral geneticdiversity.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that impoverished populations from North Waziristan serve as a possible determinant of widespreadpoliomyelitis infection in Pakistan and further emphasize the need to scale-upclinical and environmental surveillance as well as immunization activities.Â© The Author 2015.
