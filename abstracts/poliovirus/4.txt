With the promotion of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) and live attenuated
oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV), the global reported cases of poliomyelitis have
reduced sharply from 0.35 million in 1988 to 74 in 2015. The Polio Eradication & 
Endgame Strategic Plan published by WHO in 2013 included the strategy of
implementation of poliovirus safe handling and containment measures to minimize
the risks of facility-associated reintroduction of virus into the polio-free
community to prevent the re-import of poliovirus. Toward this strategy, we
produced replication-incompetent pseudovirus of poliovirus type 1, 2, 3
attenuated strains by constructing poliovirus capsid expression vectors and
poliovirus replicon then transfecting HEK293T cells and developed a
pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (pNA) to determine neutralizing antibody
titer which is more secure, time-saving and reliable than conventional
neutralization assay (cNA). By using anti-poliovirus rat serum, we demonstrated
excellent correlation between neutralizing antibody titers measured by cNA and
pNA. It was concluded that pNA can be a potential alternative to replace cNA as a
safe and time-saving system for titer determination after live poliovirus's
safekeeping.
