The Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan published by WHO in 2013 included the strategy ofimplementation of poliovirus safe handling and containment measures to minimizethe risks of facility-associated reintroduction of virus into the polio-freecommunity to prevent the re-import of poliovirus. Toward this strategy, weproduced replication-incompetent pseudovirus of poliovirus type 1, 2, 3attenuated strains by constructing poliovirus capsid expression vectors andpoliovirus replicon then transfecting HEK293T cells and developed apseudovirus-based neutralization assay (pNA) to determine neutralizing antibodytiter which is more secure, time-saving and reliable than conventionalneutralization assay (cNA). By using anti-poliovirus rat serum, we demonstratedexcellent correlation between neutralizing antibody titers measured by cNA andpNA. It was concluded that pNA can be a potential alternative to replace cNA as asafe and time-saving system for titer determination after live poliovirus'ssafekeeping.Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jmv.24909 PMID: 28786502  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
