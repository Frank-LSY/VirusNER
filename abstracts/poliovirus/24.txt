BACKGROUND: Israel has >95% polio vaccine coverage with the last 9 birth cohorts 
immunized exclusively with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Using acute flaccid
paralysis and routine, monthly countrywide environmental surveillance, no wild
poliovirus circulation was detected between 1989 and February 2013, after which
wild type 1 polioviruses South Asia genotype (WPV1-SOAS) have persistently
circulated in southern Israel and intermittently in other areas without any
paralytic cases as determined by intensified surveillance of environmental and
human samples. We aimed to characterize antigenic and neurovirulence properties
of WPV1-SOAS silently circulating in a highly vaccinated population.
METHODS: WPV1-SOAS capsid genes from environmental and stool surveillance
isolates were sequenced, their neurovirulence was determined using transgenic
mouse expressing the human poliovirus receptor (Tg21-PVR) mice, and their
antigenicity was characterized by in vitro neutralization using human sera,
epitope-specific monoclonal murine anti-oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) antibodies,
and sera from IPV-immunized rats and mice.
RESULTS: WPV1 amino acid sequences in neutralizing epitopes varied from Sabin 1
and Mahoney, with little variation among WPV1 isolates. Neutralization by
monoclonal antibodies against 3 of 4 OPV epitopes was lost. Three-fold lower
geometric mean titers (Z = -4.018; P < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) against
WPV1 than against Mahoney in human serum correlated with 4- to 6-fold lower
neutralization titers in serum from IPV-immunized rats and mice. WPV1-SOAS
isolates were neurovirulent (50% intramuscular paralytic dose in Tg21-PVR mice:
log10(7.0)). IPV-immunized mice were protected against WPV1-induced paralysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic and antigenic profile changes of WPV1-SOAS may have
contributed to the intense silent transmission, whereas the reduced
neurovirulence may have contributed to the absence of paralytic cases in the
background of high population immunity.
