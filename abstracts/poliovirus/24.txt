Using acute flaccidparalysis and routine, monthly countrywide environmental surveillance, no wildpoliovirus circulation was detected between 1989 and February 2013, after whichwild type 1 polioviruses South Asia genotype (WPV1-SOAS) have persistentlycirculated in southern Israel and intermittently in other areas without anyparalytic cases as determined by intensified surveillance of environmental andhuman samples. We aimed to characterize antigenic and neurovirulence propertiesof WPV1-SOAS silently circulating in a highly vaccinated population.METHODS: WPV1-SOAS capsid genes from environmental and stool surveillanceisolates were sequenced, their neurovirulence was determined using transgenicmouse expressing the human poliovirus receptor (Tg21-PVR) mice, and theirantigenicity was characterized by in vitro neutralization using human sera,epitope-specific monoclonal murine anti-oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) antibodies,and sera from IPV-immunized rats and mice.RESULTS: WPV1 amino acid sequences in neutralizing epitopes varied from Sabin 1and Mahoney, with little variation among WPV1 isolates. Neutralization bymonoclonal antibodies against 3 of 4 OPV epitopes was lost. Three-fold lowergeometric mean titers (Z = -4.018; P < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) againstWPV1 than against Mahoney in human serum correlated with 4- to 6-fold lowerneutralization titers in serum from IPV-immunized rats and mice. WPV1-SOASisolates were neurovirulent (50% intramuscular paralytic dose in Tg21-PVR mice:log10(7.0)). IPV-immunized mice were protected against WPV1-induced paralysis.CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic and antigenic profile changes of WPV1-SOAS may havecontributed to the intense silent transmission, whereas the reducedneurovirulence may have contributed to the absence of paralytic cases in thebackground of high population immunity.© The Author 2014.
