The model explicitly considersserotype differences and distinguishes fecal-oral and oropharyngeal transmission.We evaluated the model by simulating diverse historical experiences withpolioviruses, including one country that eliminated wild poliovirus using bothOPV and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (USA), three importation outbreaksof wild poliovirus (Albania, the Netherlands, Tajikistan), one situation in whichno circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) emerge despite annual OPVuse and cessation (Cuba), three cVDPV outbreaks (Haiti, Madura Island inIndonesia, northern Nigeria), one area of current endemic circulation of allthree serotypes (northern Nigeria), and one area with recent endemic circulation and subsequent elimination of multiple serotypes (northern India). We find thatwhen sufficient information about the conditions exists, the model can reproduce the general behavior of poliovirus transmission and outbreaks while maintainingconsistency in the generic model inputs. The assumption of spatially homogeneous mixing remains a significant limitation that affects the performance of thedifferential equation-based model when significant heterogeneities in immunityand mixing may exist. Further studies on OPV virus evolution and improvedunderstanding of the mechanisms of mixing and transmission may help to bettercharacterize poliovirus transmission in populations. Broad application of themodel promises to offer insights in the context of global and national policy andeconomic models.Â© 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.DOI: 10.1111/risa.12044 PMID: 23521018  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
