Environmentalsurveillance can provide an opportunity to detect circulating polioviruses prior to the observation of any acute flaccid paralysis cases. We completed asystematic review of peer-reviewed publications on environmental surveillance forpolio including the search terms "environmental surveillance" or "sewage," and"polio," "poliovirus," or "poliomyelitis," and compared characteristics of theresulting studies. The review included 146 studies representing 101 environmentalsurveillance activities from 48 countries published between 1975 and 2016.Studies reported taking samples from sewage treatment facilities, surface waters,and various other environmental sources, although they generally did not present sufficient details to thoroughly evaluate the sewage systems and catchment areas.When reported, catchment areas varied from 50 to over 7.3 million people (median of 500,000 for the 25% of activities that reported catchment areas, notably with 60% of the studies not reporting this information and 16% reporting insufficient information to estimate the catchment area population size). While numerousstudies reported the ability of environmental surveillance to detect poliovirusesin the absence of clinical cases, the review revealed very limited informationabout the costs and limited information to support quantitative populationeffectiveness of conducting environmental surveillance. This review motivatesfuture studies to better characterize poliovirus environmental surveillancesystems and the potential value of information that they may provide in the polioendgame.DOI: 10.1007/s12560-017-9314-4 PMID: 28687986  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
