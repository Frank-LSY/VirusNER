It is a non-enveloped RNA viruswith a small (~7.5-kb) genome of positive polarity. It has long served as a modelto study RNA virus biology, pathogenesis, and evolution. cDNA clones of severalstrains are available, and infectious virus can be produced by the transfectionof in vitro transcribed viral genomes into an appropriate host cell. PV infectsmany human and non-human primate cell lines including HeLa and HeLa S3 cells, andcan grow to high titer in culture. Protocols for the production, propagation,quantification, and purification of PV are presented.Â© 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/9780471729259.mc15h01s29 PMCID: PMC4826561PMID: 23686830  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
