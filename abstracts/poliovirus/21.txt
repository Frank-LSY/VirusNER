If a newly enveloped virus has budded throughthe plasma membrane, it finds itself outside the cell immediately. If it hasbudded through the bounding membrane of an internal compartment such as the ER,the virus finds itself in the lumen, from which it can exit the cell via theconventional secretion pathway. Thus, although some enveloped viruses destroy thecells they infect, there is no topological need to do so. On the other hand,naked viruses such as poliovirus lack an external membrane. They areprotein-nucleic acid complexes within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the infectedcell, like a ribosome, a spliceosome or an aggregate of Huntingtin protein. Thesimplest way for such a particle to pass through the single lipid bilayer thatseparates it from the outside of the cell would be to violate the integrity ofthat bilayer. Thus, it is not surprising that the primary mode of exit fornon-enveloped viruses is cell lysis. However, more complex exit strategies arepossible, such as the creation of new compartments whose complex topologies allowthe exit of cytoplasm and its contents without violating the integrity of thecell. Here we will discuss the non-lytic spread of poliovirus and recentobservations of such compartments during viral infection with several differentpicornaviruses.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
