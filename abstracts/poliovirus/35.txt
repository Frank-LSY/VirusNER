Box 1, 3720 BABilthoven, The Netherlands.This article gives an overview of the patent literature related to innovativeinactivated polio vaccine (i-IPV) based on using Sabin poliovirus strains andnewly developed alternative recombinant poliovirus strains. This innovativeapproach for IPV manufacturing is considered to attribute to the requirement for affordable IPV in the post-polio-eradication era, which is on the horizon.Although IPV is a well-established vaccine, the number of patent applications in this field was seen to have significantly increased in the past decade.Currently, regular IPV appears to be too expensive for universal use. Futureaffordability may be achieved by using alternative cell lines, alternative virus seed strains, improved and optimized processes, dose sparing, or the use ofadjuvants. A relatively short-term option to achieve cost-price reduction is towork on regular IPV, using wild-type poliovirus strains, or on Sabin-IPV, basedon using attenuated poliovirus strains. This price reduction can be achieved byintroducing efficiency in processing. There are also multiple opportunities towork on dose sparing, for example, by using adjuvants or fractional doses.Renewed interest in this field was clearly reflected in the number and diversity of patent applications. In a later stage, several innovative approaches maybecome even more attractive, for example the use of recombinant virus strains or even a totally synthetic vaccine. Currently, such work is mainly carried out byresearch institutes and universities and therefore clinical data are notavailable.DOI: 10.4155/ppa.12.70 PMID: 24236927  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
