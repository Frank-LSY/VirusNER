Despite being intensely studied for more than 50 years, a complete understanding 
of the enterovirus replication cycle remains elusive. Specifically, only a
handful of cellular proteins have been shown to be involved in the RNA
replication cycle of these viruses. In an effort to isolate and identify
additional cellular proteins that function in enteroviral RNA replication, we
have generated multiple recombinant polioviruses containing RNA affinity tags
within the 3' or 5' noncoding region of the genome. These recombinant viruses
retained RNA affinity sequences within the genome while remaining viable and
infectious over multiple passages in cell culture. Further characterization of
these viruses demonstrated that viral protein production and growth kinetics were
unchanged or only slightly altered relative to wild type poliovirus. However,
attempts to isolate these genetically-tagged viral genomes from infected cells
have been hindered by high levels of co-purification of nonspecific proteins and 
the limited matrix-binding efficiency of RNA affinity sequences. Regardless,
these recombinant viruses represent a step toward more thorough characterization 
of enterovirus ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in RNA replication.
