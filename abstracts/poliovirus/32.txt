Wild poliovirus transmission has never beeninterrupted in this block due to war against terrorism, poor public healthinfrastructure, misconceptions about polio vaccines and inadequate immunizationactivities. All these issues complicate the eradication operations and reinforce the complexity of wiping out poliomyelitis from this region. This studyillustrates the origins and routes of cross-border wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) transmission during 2010-2012 between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Sequence analyseswere conducted based on complete VP1 capsid protein sequences for WPV1 studystrains to determine the origin of poliovirus genetic lineages and theirevolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic tree was constructed from VP1 genesequences applying Maximum Likelihood method using Kimura 2- parameter model inMEGA program v 5.0. A total of 72 (14.3%) out of 502 wild-type 1 polioviruseswere found circulating in border areas of both countries during 2010-2012.Molecular phylogenetic analysis classified these strains in to two sub-genotypes with four clusters and 18 lineages. Genetic data confirmed that the most of WPV1 lineages (12; 66.6%) were transmitted from Pakistan to Afghanistan. However, the genetic diversity was significantly reduced during 2012 as most of the lineageswere completely eliminated. In conclusion, Pakistan-Afghanistan block has emergedas a single poliovirus reservoir sharing the multiple poliovirus lineages due to uncontrolled movement of people across the borders between two countries. If itis neglected, it can jeopardize the extensive global efforts done so-far toeradicate the poliovirus infection. Our data will be helpful to devise thepreventive strategies for effective control of wild poliovirus transmission inthis region.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107697 PMCID: PMC4168008PMID: 25229826  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
