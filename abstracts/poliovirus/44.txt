Virus Res. 2005 Aug;111(2):175-93.Poliovirus and poliomyelitis: a tale of guts, brains, and an accidental event.Mueller S(1), Wimmer E, Cello J.Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University,Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.Nearly 100 years after its discovery poliovirus remains one of most thoroughlystudied and best understood virus models for the molecular virologist. Whilepoliovirus has been of vital importance for our insight into picornavirus biologyat the cellular and biochemical level, it is ironic to note that, due to theearly success in defeating poliomyelitis in the developed world throughvaccination, many of the basic aspects of poliovirus pathogenesis remain poorlyunderstood. This is chiefly due to the lack of an adequate and affordable animal model, save of old world monkeys. Fundamental questions, such as the identity of the target cells during the enteric phase of infection, or mechanisms of systemicspread are still unanswered. This review will attempt to summarize our currentknowledge of the molecular biology of poliovirus, its pathogenesis, as well asrecent advances in the areas of cell and tissue tropism and mechanisms of centralnervous system invasion.DOI: 10.1016/j.virusres.2005.04.008 PMID: 15885840  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
