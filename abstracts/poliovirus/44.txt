Nearly 100 years after its discovery poliovirus remains one of most thoroughly
studied and best understood virus models for the molecular virologist. While
poliovirus has been of vital importance for our insight into picornavirus biology
at the cellular and biochemical level, it is ironic to note that, due to the
early success in defeating poliomyelitis in the developed world through
vaccination, many of the basic aspects of poliovirus pathogenesis remain poorly
understood. This is chiefly due to the lack of an adequate and affordable animal 
model, save of old world monkeys. Fundamental questions, such as the identity of 
the target cells during the enteric phase of infection, or mechanisms of systemic
spread are still unanswered. This review will attempt to summarize our current
knowledge of the molecular biology of poliovirus, its pathogenesis, as well as
recent advances in the areas of cell and tissue tropism and mechanisms of central
nervous system invasion.
