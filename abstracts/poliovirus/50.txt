J Virol Methods. 1987 Oct;18(1):25-36.Intratypic differentiation of poliovirus strains by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA): poliovirus type 2 and poliovirus type 3.Glikmann G(1), Pedersen M, Petersen I.Author information: (1)Ornithosis Department, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark.A double-antibody sandwich ELISA was developed for the detection of antigenicdifferences between wild and vaccine-derived strains of poliovirus type 2 andpoliovirus type 3. Antibodies were prepared in rabbits by immunization withpurified antigens of vaccine strains (type 2: Sabin P712, and type 3: Sabin Leon)and wild type strains (type 2: MEF, and type 3: Pool 30). Immunoblotting analysisof all antisera demonstrated that the IgG antibodies raised in rabbits havespecificity towards the main structural proteins (Vp1, Vp2 and Vp3) ofpoliovirus. IgG fractions were purified from antisera by affinity chromatography,on a protein A-activated Sepharose 4B column. Purified IgG antibodies were usedfor coating of microtest plates (catching antibodies). The same reagents labelledwith horseradish peroxidase were used as conjugates, after cross-adsorption with antigens of the same type heterologous virus strains (strain-specificconjugates). 29 poliovirus type 2 strains and 73 poliovirus type 3 strainsisolated from clinical samples, were differentiated intratypically, asvaccine-derived or wild types, no intermediate strains were found and all samplestested fell in two distinct (vaccine/wild) categories. As little as 40 ng ofpoliovirus antigens was detected in stool samples from healthy children or frompolio patients cultivated in monkey kidney tissue cultures. Preparation of strainspecific conjugates did not require large amounts of poliovirus antigens. Thedeveloped ELISA, which is economic and capable of (1) detection of low amounts ofpoliovirus antigens in cultivated clinical samples, and (2) intratypicdifferentiation of poliovirus antigens as either vaccine-derived or wild type, istherefore well suited for large scale screening of poliovirus isolates.PMID: 2826518  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
