Epub 2013 Mar 13.Anti-poliovirus activity of protease inhibitor AG-7404, and assessment of invitro activity in combination with antiviral capsid inhibitor compounds.Rhoden E(1), Liu HM, Wang-Chern SW, Oberste MS.Author information: (1)Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. erhoden@cdc.govErratum in    Antiviral Res. 2013 Sep;99(3):436.The National Research Council has recommended that at least one, preferably two, polio antiviral drugs be developed as a supplement to the tools currentlyavailable for control of polio outbreaks post-eradication. The primaryapplication of such drugs is expected to be the resolution of chronic poliovirus excretion in persons with primary immunodeficiency disorders. We have assessedthe in vitro activity of AG-7404 (also known as "compound 1"), an inhibitor ofpicornaviral 3C protease, against a large panel of programmatically importantpoliovirus strains and its activity in combination with two poliovirus capsidinhibitors, V-073 and BTA798. AG-7404 was active against all viruses in thispanel, with EC50 values ranging from 0.080 to 0.674 μM. Similarly, BTA798 wasactive against all viruses in this panel, with EC50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.591μM. By comparison, values for V-073 were 0.003-0.126 μM. BTA798 was activeagainst V-073-resistant variants with an alanine to valine change in VP3 atposition 24. However, BTA798 was inactive against the V-073-resistant strainswith amino acid substitutions at VP1 amino acids 194 (equivalent to 192 in type3) and 236. As expected from its different mechanism of action, AG-7404 was fullyactive against all V-073-resistant variants, with EC₅₀ values ranging from 0.218 to 0.819 μM, compared to values of 0.202-0.407 μM for the V-073-susceptibleparental strains. In vitro drug combination experiments demonstrated synergybetween AG-7404 and either V-073 or BTA798, whereas the combination of the twocapsid inhibitors acted additively.Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.003 PMID: 23499651  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
