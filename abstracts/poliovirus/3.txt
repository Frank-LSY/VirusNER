In thisstudy, we collected 139 sewage samples from 8 regions in Heilongjiang province.Poliovirus was identified from 72 samples, and the positivity rate was 51%. Atotal of 263 PV strains were isolated, including 22 strains of type 1 PV, 104strains of type 2 PV, and 137 strains of type 3 PV. As a result of intratypicdifferentiation, using real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing, 3 type 1pre-VDPV, one type 2 VDPV, and 2 type 3 pre-VDPV strains were isolated.Interestingly, one type 1 strain with 5 nucleotide deletions and one type 3recombinant on VP1 were isolated. By continuously monitoring the poliovirus inthe environment, we aimed to recognize the VDPV or wild poliovirus with highneurovirulence from large-scale circulation and set up a warning system to avoid morbidity and virus transmission.DOI: 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2017.338 PMID: 30068885  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
