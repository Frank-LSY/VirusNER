To date, evaluation of these mutations has been performed primarily on culture-enriched isolates byusing conventional Sanger sequencing. We therefore developed aculture-independent, deep-sequencing method targeting the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and P1 genomic region to characterize vaccine-related poliovirus variants. Error analysis of the deep-sequencing method demonstrated reliable detection ofpoliovirus mutations at levels of <1%, depending on read depth. Sequencing ofviral nucleic acids from the stool of vaccinated, asymptomatic children and theirclose contacts collected during a prospective cohort study in Veracruz, Mexico,revealed no vaccine-derived polioviruses. This was expected given that thelongest duration between sequenced sample collection and the end of the mostrecent national immunization week was 66 days. However, we identified manylow-level variants (<5%) distributed across the 5' UTR and P1 genomic region inall three Sabin serotypes, as well as vaccine-related viruses with multiplecanonical mutations associated with phenotypic reversion present at high levels(>90%). These results suggest that monitoring emerging vaccine-related poliovirusvariants by deep sequencing may aid in the poliovirus endgame and efforts toensure global polio eradication.Copyright © 2017 Sahoo et al.DOI: 10.1128/JCM.00144-17 PMCID: PMC5483918PMID: 28468861  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
