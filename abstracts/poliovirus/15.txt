Despite substantial progress, polio remains endemic in several countries and new imported cases are reported on a regular basis (http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp ).It was recognized by thepoliovirus research community that developing antivirals against poliovirus wouldbe invaluable in the post-OPV era. Here, we describe three methods essential for the identification of selective inhibitors of poliovirus replication and fordetermining their mode of action by time-of-drug-addition studies as well as bythe isolation of compound-resistant poliovirus variants.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3292-4_17 PMID: 26983743  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
