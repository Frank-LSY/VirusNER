Ahigh mutation rate fuels adaptation but also generates deleterious mutations.Recombination between two different genomes may resolve this paradox, alleviatingeffects of clonal interference and purging deleterious mutations. Here wedemonstrate that recombination significantly accelerates adaptation and evolutionduring acute virus infection. We identified a poliovirus recombinationdeterminant within the virus polymerase, mutation of which reduces recombination rates without altering replication fidelity. By generating a panel of variantswith distinct mutation rates and recombination ability, we demonstrate thatrecombination is essential to enrich the population in beneficial mutations andpurge it from deleterious mutations. The concerted activities of mutation andrecombination are key to virus spread and virulence in infected animals. Thesefindings inform a mathematical model to demonstrate that poliovirus adapts mostrapidly at an optimal mutation rate determined by the trade-off between selectionand accumulation of detrimental mutations.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.
