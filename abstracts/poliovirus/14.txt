Mutation and recombination are central processes driving microbial evolution. A
high mutation rate fuels adaptation but also generates deleterious mutations.
Recombination between two different genomes may resolve this paradox, alleviating
effects of clonal interference and purging deleterious mutations. Here we
demonstrate that recombination significantly accelerates adaptation and evolution
during acute virus infection. We identified a poliovirus recombination
determinant within the virus polymerase, mutation of which reduces recombination 
rates without altering replication fidelity. By generating a panel of variants
with distinct mutation rates and recombination ability, we demonstrate that
recombination is essential to enrich the population in beneficial mutations and
purge it from deleterious mutations. The concerted activities of mutation and
recombination are key to virus spread and virulence in infected animals. These
findings inform a mathematical model to demonstrate that poliovirus adapts most
rapidly at an optimal mutation rate determined by the trade-off between selection
and accumulation of detrimental mutations.
