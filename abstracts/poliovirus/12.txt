Electronic address: okayasuh@who.int.(2)Research and Product Development Team, Polio Eradication Department, The WorldHealth Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.(3)Institute for Translational Vaccinology, Intravacc, Bilthoven, TheNetherlands.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has seen significant progresssince it began in 1988, largely due to the worldwide use of oral poliovirusvaccine (OPV). In order to achieve polio eradication the global cessation of OPV is necessary because OPV contains live attenuated poliovirus, which in rarecircumstances could re-gain wild poliovirus (WPV) characteristics with potential to establish transmission. The GPEI endgame strategy for the period 2013-2018recommends the globally synchronised sequential cessation of the Sabin strainscontained in the OPV, starting with type 2 Sabin. The withdrawal of Sabin type 2 took place in April 2016, with the introduction of at least one dose ofinactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) as a risk mitigation strategy. Theintroduction of IPV into 126 countries since 2013 has required a rapid scale-upof IPV production by the two manufacturers supplying the global public sectormarket. This scale-up has been fraught with challenges, resulting in reductionsof 40-50% of initial supply commitments. Consequently, 22 countries will not besupplied until 2018, and another 23 countries will experience serious stock-outs.In the last decade repeated calls-for-action were made to the global community toinvigorate their vision and investment in developing "new poliovirus vaccines"including the development of IPV from less-virulent strains, such as Sabin-IPV(S-IPV). The conventional Salk-IPV production is limited to high-incomeindustrialized-country manufacturers due to the containment requirements (i.e.,high sanitation, low force-of-poliovirus-infection, and high populationimmunity). The use of Sabin strains in the production of S-IPV carries a lowerbiosafety risk, and was determined to be suitable for production in developingcountries, expanding the manufacturing base and making IPV more affordable andaccessible in the long term. Significant progress in the S-IPV has been madesince 2006. S-IPV is now licensed as S-IPV in Japan and as standalone S-IPV inChina, demonstrating the feasibility of this vaccine. In addition, productionprocess improvements can further reduce the cost of production. The latter arecritical to the economic success of this vaccine in the global market. Wesummarize the progress made to date in S-IPV technology, the scientific data and economic evidence in support of S-IPV development.Copyright © 2016 International Alliance for Biological Standardization.
