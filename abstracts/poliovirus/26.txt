Poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is a human enterovirus and
member of the Picornaviridae family. An effective live-attenuated poliovirus
vaccine strain (Sabin 1) has been developed and has protected humans from polio. 
However, a few cases of vaccine virulence reversion have been documented in
several countries. For instance, circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus is
a highly pathogenic poliovirus that evolved from an avirulent strain, but the
mechanism by which vaccine strains undergo reversion remains unclear. In this
study, vaccine strains exhibited A to G/U to C and G to A/C to U hypermutations
in the reversed evolution of Sabin 1. Furthermore, the mutation ratios of U to C 
and C to U were higher than those of other mutation types. Dinucleotide editing
context was then analyzed. Results showed that A to G and U to C mutations
exhibited preferences similar to adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR).
Hence, ADARs may participate in poliovirus vaccine evolution.
