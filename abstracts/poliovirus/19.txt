At the time of writing,the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria occurred in July2014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in Somalia in August2014. No cases associated with circulating vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus(cVDPV2) have been detected in Nigeria since November 2014. Has WPV1 beeneliminated from Africa? Has WPV3 been eradicated globally? Has Nigeriainterrupted cVDPV2 transmission? These questions are difficult because poliosurveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small fraction of infections. This report provides estimates for the probabilities of polioviruselimination in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio incidencerates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission dynamics andpoliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long time periodswithout cases. The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability ofWPV1 elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, anew case will be detected with 99% probability by the end of 2015. Theprobability of WPV3 elimination (and thus global eradication) is > 99%. However, it is unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the probability of cVDPV2 elimination rises to 83% if no new cases are detected byApril 2016.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0135765 PMCID: PMC4552877PMID: 26317401  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
