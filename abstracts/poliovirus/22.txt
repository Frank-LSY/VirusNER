BACKGROUND: The effect of transport temperature on the viability of poliovirus in
stool specimens from paralyzed cases has not been tested. Quality assurance of
programmatic indicators will be necessary in the final phase of polio
eradication.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of time at elevated temperatures on wild
poliovirus titers in stool specimens.
METHODS: We exposed aliquots of pooled wild poliovirus type 1 specimens to
elevated temperatures (27 °C, 31 °C, and 35 °C) for varying time periods up to 14
days. We determined the virus titer of these aliquots and created decay curves at
each temperature to estimate the relationship between time at temperature and
virus titer.
RESULTS: We found significantly different slopes of decay at each temperature.
The negative slopes increased as the temperature increased.
CONCLUSIONS: While poliovirus in stool remains relatively stable at moderately
elevated temperature, transport at higher temperatures could impact sample
integrity and virus isolation results.
