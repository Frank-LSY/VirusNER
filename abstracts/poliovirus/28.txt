BACKGROUND: The environmental surveillance has proven to be a useful tool to
identify poliovirus circulation in different countries and was started in
Pakistan during July 2009 to support the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)
surveillance system.
METHODS: Sewage samples were collected from 27 environmental sampling (ENV) sites
and processed for poliovirus isolation through 2-phase separation method.
Poliovirus isolates were identified as Sabin-like or wild type through real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Wild-type strains were subjected to VP1 gene
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis performed using MEGA 5.0.
RESULTS: During 2011-2013, a total of 668 samples were collected from 4 provinces
that resulted in 40% of samples positive for wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV-1). None
of the samples were positive for WPV-3. The areas with high frequency of WPV-1
detection were Karachi-Gadap (69%), Peshawar (82%), and Rawalpindi (65%), whereas
the samples from Quetta and Sukkur remained negative for WPV during 2013.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clusters with multiple poliovirus lineages
circulating across different country areas as well as in bordering areas of
Afghanistan.
CONCLUSIONS: Environmental surveillance in Pakistan has been proven to be a
powerful tool to detect WPV circulation in the absence of poliomyelitis cases in 
many communities. Our findings emphasize the need to continue and expand such
surveillance activities to other high-risk areas in the country.
