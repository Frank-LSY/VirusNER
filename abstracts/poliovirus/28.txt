Wild-type strains were subjected to VP1 genesequencing and phylogenetic analysis performed using MEGA 5.0.RESULTS: During 2011-2013, a total of 668 samples were collected from 4 provincesthat resulted in 40% of samples positive for wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV-1). Noneof the samples were positive for WPV-3. The areas with high frequency of WPV-1detection were Karachi-Gadap (69%), Peshawar (82%), and Rawalpindi (65%), whereasthe samples from Quetta and Sukkur remained negative for WPV during 2013.Phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clusters with multiple poliovirus lineagescirculating across different country areas as well as in bordering areas ofAfghanistan.CONCLUSIONS: Environmental surveillance in Pakistan has been proven to be apowerful tool to detect WPV circulation in the absence of poliomyelitis cases in many communities. Our findings emphasize the need to continue and expand suchsurveillance activities to other high-risk areas in the country.Â© The Author 2014.
