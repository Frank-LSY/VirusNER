Infection with enteropathogens at the time of vaccination may contributeto this phenomenon. However, the relative influence of these infections on OPVperformance remains uncertain.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of concurrententeric infections on OPV response. Using random-effects models, we assessed the effects of nonpolio enteroviruses (NPEVs) and diarrhea on the odds ofseroconversion and/or vaccine virus shedding.RESULTS: We identified 25 trials in which OPV outcomes were compared according tothe presence or absence of enteric infections, the majority of which (n = 17)reported only on NPEVs. Concurrent NPEVs significantly reduced the odds ofper-dose seroconversion for type 1 poliovirus (odds ratio [OR] 0.44, 95%confidence interval 0.23-0.84), but not type 2 (OR 0.53 [0.19-1.46]) or type 3(OR 0.56 [0.27-1.12]). A similar reduction, significant for type 1 poliovirus (OR0.50 [0.28-0.89]), was observed in the odds of vaccine virus shedding amongNPEV-infected individuals. Concurrent diarrhea significantly inhibited per-doseseroconversion overall (OR 0.61 [0.38-0.87]).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with an inhibitory effect of concurrent enteric infections on OPV response.Â© The Author 2014.
