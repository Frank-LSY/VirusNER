The three poliovirus serotypes are very stable. Breakthrough of the serotype
barrier has never been observed in the natural evolution of poliovirus. This
serotype stability contrasts with the high level of genomic and phenotypic
variability that occurs within the bounds of serotype. The efficient control of
poliomyelitis by immunization is based upon type-specific immunity and serotype
stability. The development of attenuated strains by Albert Sabin was possible
because of the high variability of poliovirus genomes. The three Sabin strains,
one for each serotype, were selected as variants of non-attenuated wild
polioviruses, and each represents a unique poliovirus genotype. A consequence of 
poliovirus variability is the polymorphic character of its genome. This
polymorphism makes possible the identification of poliovirus genotypes upon which
studies on poliovirus evolution, virologic surveillance, and poliomyelitis
diagnostics are based. The antigenic and genomic peculiarities of the Sabin
strains are used to distinguish them from wild polioviruses among field isolates.
The mechanisms of poliovirus variation and their significance to the evolution of
both wild and vaccine poliovirus strains are the subjects of this article. The
natural evolution of polioviruses is discussed in the context of the global
initiative to eradicate poliomyelitis, which relies on the worldwide use of
Sabin's vaccine.
