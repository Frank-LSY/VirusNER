47. Biologicals. 1993 Dec;21(4):379-84.Evolution and polymorphism of poliovirus genomes.Crainic R(1), Kew O.Author information: (1)Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.The three poliovirus serotypes are very stable. Breakthrough of the serotypebarrier has never been observed in the natural evolution of poliovirus. Thisserotype stability contrasts with the high level of genomic and phenotypicvariability that occurs within the bounds of serotype. The efficient control ofpoliomyelitis by immunization is based upon type-specific immunity and serotypestability. The development of attenuated strains by Albert Sabin was possiblebecause of the high variability of poliovirus genomes. The three Sabin strains,one for each serotype, were selected as variants of non-attenuated wildpolioviruses, and each represents a unique poliovirus genotype. A consequence of poliovirus variability is the polymorphic character of its genome. Thispolymorphism makes possible the identification of poliovirus genotypes upon whichstudies on poliovirus evolution, virologic surveillance, and poliomyelitisdiagnostics are based. The antigenic and genomic peculiarities of the Sabinstrains are used to distinguish them from wild polioviruses among field isolates.The mechanisms of poliovirus variation and their significance to the evolution ofboth wild and vaccine poliovirus strains are the subjects of this article. Thenatural evolution of polioviruses is discussed in the context of the globalinitiative to eradicate poliomyelitis, which relies on the worldwide use ofSabin's vaccine.DOI: 10.1006/biol.1993.1099 PMID: 8024754  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
