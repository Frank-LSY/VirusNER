Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven, TheNetherlands. Hein.Boot@RIVM.NLThe emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains insuboptimally vaccinated populations is a serious threat to the global poliovirus eradication. The genetic determinants for the transmissibility phenotype ofpolioviruses, and in particularly of cVDPV strains, are currently unknown. Herewe describe the fecal excretion of wild-type poliovirus, oral polio vaccine, and cVDPV (Hispaniola) strains after intraperitoneal injection in poliovirusreceptor-transgenic mice. Both the pattern and the level of fecal excretion ofthe cVDPV strains resemble those of wild-type poliovirus type 1. In contrast,very little poliovirus was present in the feces after oral polio vaccineadministration. This mouse model will be helpful in elucidating the geneticdeterminants for the high fecal-oral transmission phenotype of cVDPV strains.PMCID: PMC155012PMID: 12743311  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
