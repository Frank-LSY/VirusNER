The emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains in
suboptimally vaccinated populations is a serious threat to the global poliovirus 
eradication. The genetic determinants for the transmissibility phenotype of
polioviruses, and in particularly of cVDPV strains, are currently unknown. Here
we describe the fecal excretion of wild-type poliovirus, oral polio vaccine, and 
cVDPV (Hispaniola) strains after intraperitoneal injection in poliovirus
receptor-transgenic mice. Both the pattern and the level of fecal excretion of
the cVDPV strains resemble those of wild-type poliovirus type 1. In contrast,
very little poliovirus was present in the feces after oral polio vaccine
administration. This mouse model will be helpful in elucidating the genetic
determinants for the high fecal-oral transmission phenotype of cVDPV strains.
