Overthe past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. Theearliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses suchas Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with envelopeproteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelopeprotein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can efficientlyintroduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, gammaretroviral vectorshave the disadvantage that they are unable to efficiently transduce nondividingor slowly dividing cells. As a result, specific protocols have been developed to activate cells through the use of growth factors and cytokines. In the case ofhematopoietic stem cells, activation has to be carefully controlled so thatpluripotency is maintained. For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors arebeing superseded by lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virustype-1 (HIV-1) which has additional accessory proteins that enable integration inthe absence of cell division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vectordesign has evolved to address a number of safety concerns. These include separateexpression of the viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading tothe generation of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development ofself-inactivating (SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation ofneighboring genes and allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that maytarget gene expression more physiologically to particular cell types.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.
