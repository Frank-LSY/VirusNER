Many important aspects of human retroviral infections cannot be fully evaluated
using only in vitro systems or unmodified animal models. An alternative approach 
involves the use of humanized mice, which consist of immunodeficient mice that
have been transplanted with human cells and/or tissues. Certain humanized mouse
models can support robust infection with human retroviruses including different
strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T cell leukemia virus
(HTLV). These models have provided wide-ranging insights into retroviral biology,
including detailed information on primary infection, in vivo replication and
pathogenesis, latent/persistent reservoir formation, and novel therapeutic
interventions. Here we describe the humanized mouse models that are most commonly
utilized to study retroviral infections, and outline some of the important
discoveries that these models have produced during several decades of intensive
research.
