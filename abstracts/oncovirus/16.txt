An alternative approach involves the use of humanized mice, which consist of immunodeficient mice thathave been transplanted with human cells and/or tissues. Certain humanized mousemodels can support robust infection with human retroviruses including differentstrains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T cell leukemia virus(HTLV). These models have provided wide-ranging insights into retroviral biology,including detailed information on primary infection, in vivo replication andpathogenesis, latent/persistent reservoir formation, and novel therapeuticinterventions. Here we describe the humanized mouse models that are most commonlyutilized to study retroviral infections, and outline some of the importantdiscoveries that these models have produced during several decades of intensiveresearch.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
