In macrophages and dendritic cells, SAMHD1restricts virus replication by diminishing the deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool to a level below that which supports lentiviral reverse transcription. HIV-2 and related SIVs encode the accessory protein Vpx to induce the proteasomaldegradation of SAMHD1 following virus entry. While SAMHD1 has been shown torestrict HIV-1 and SIV, the breadth of its restriction is not known and whetherother viruses have a means to counteract the restriction has not been determined.RESULTS: We show that SAMHD1 restricts a wide array of divergent retroviruses,including the alpha, beta and gamma classes. Murine leukemia virus was restrictedby SAMHD1 in macrophages yet removal of SAMHD1 did not alleviate the block toinfection because of an additional block to viral nuclear import. Prototype foamyvirus (PFV) and Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) were the onlyretroviruses tested that were not restricted by SAMHD1. PFV reverse transcribespredominantly prior to entry and thus is unaffected by the dNTP level in thetarget cell. It is possible that HTLV-1 has a mechanism to render the virusresistant to SAMHD1-mediated restriction.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SAMHD1 has broad anti-retroviral activityagainst which most viruses have not found an escape.DOI: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-26 PMCID: PMC3605129PMID: 23497255  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
