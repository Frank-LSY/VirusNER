The host range of retroviral vectors including lentiviral vectors can be expanded
or altered by a process known as pseudotyping. Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors
consist of vector particles bearing glycoproteins (GPs) derived from other
enveloped viruses. Such particles possess the tropism of the virus from which the
GP was derived. For example, to exploit the natural neural tropism of rabies
virus, vectors designed to target the central nervous system have been
pseudotyped using rabies virus-derived GPs. Among the first and still most widely
used GPs for pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is the vesicular stomatitis virus GP
(VSV-G), due to the very broad tropism and stability of the resulting
pseudotypes. Pseudotypes involving VSV-G have become effectively the standard for
evaluating the efficiency of other pseudotypes. This review samples a few of the 
more prominent examples from the ever-expanding list of published lentiviral
pseudotypes, noting comparisons made with pseudotypes involving VSV-G in terms of
titer, viral particle stability, toxicity, and host-cell specificity. Particular 
attention is paid to publications of successfully targeting a specific organ or
cell types.
