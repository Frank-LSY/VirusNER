Pseudotyped lentiviral vectorsconsist of vector particles bearing glycoproteins (GPs) derived from otherenveloped viruses. Such particles possess the tropism of the virus from which theGP was derived. For example, to exploit the natural neural tropism of rabiesvirus, vectors designed to target the central nervous system have beenpseudotyped using rabies virus-derived GPs. Among the first and still most widelyused GPs for pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is the vesicular stomatitis virus GP(VSV-G), due to the very broad tropism and stability of the resultingpseudotypes. Pseudotypes involving VSV-G have become effectively the standard forevaluating the efficiency of other pseudotypes. This review samples a few of the more prominent examples from the ever-expanding list of published lentiviralpseudotypes, noting comparisons made with pseudotypes involving VSV-G in terms oftiter, viral particle stability, toxicity, and host-cell specificity. Particular attention is paid to publications of successfully targeting a specific organ orcell types.PMCID: PMC1368960PMID: 16101513  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
