Oncovirus, synonymously called a 'tumour virus', is a virus that can cause
cancer. An oncolytic virus preferentially infects the host's cancer cells and
lyses them, causing tumour destruction, and is thus referred to as a 'cancer
killing virus'. With an estimated 11% of cancer-associated deaths caused by
oncoviruses and the possibility that many cancers may be treated by using
oncolytic viruses, the role of viruses in cancer may be viewed as a double-edged 
sword. A total of seven human cancer viruses have been identified as oncoviruses,
having been associated with various cancers. Conversely, a large number of
oncolytic viruses have shown great potential towards the treatment of certain
types of cancer. Proteomics has now been applied towards understanding the
complex interplay that exists between oncoviruses and the immune responses that
serve to prevent oncoviral diseases. This review attempts to summarise the
neoplastic potential of human tumour associated viruses and associated vaccine
successes. The potential use of oncolytic viruses for the therapeutic
intervention of cancer will also be discussed. Finally, this review will discuss 
the enormous potential of proteomics technology in the field of oncovirology.
