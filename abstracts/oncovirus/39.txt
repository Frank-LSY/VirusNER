Kildare, Ireland.Oncovirus, synonymously called a 'tumour virus', is a virus that can causecancer. An oncolytic virus preferentially infects the host's cancer cells andlyses them, causing tumour destruction, and is thus referred to as a 'cancerkilling virus'. With an estimated 11% of cancer-associated deaths caused byoncoviruses and the possibility that many cancers may be treated by usingoncolytic viruses, the role of viruses in cancer may be viewed as a double-edged sword. A total of seven human cancer viruses have been identified as oncoviruses,having been associated with various cancers. Conversely, a large number ofoncolytic viruses have shown great potential towards the treatment of certaintypes of cancer. Proteomics has now been applied towards understanding thecomplex interplay that exists between oncoviruses and the immune responses thatserve to prevent oncoviral diseases. This review attempts to summarise theneoplastic potential of human tumour associated viruses and associated vaccinesuccesses. The potential use of oncolytic viruses for the therapeuticintervention of cancer will also be discussed. Finally, this review will discuss the enormous potential of proteomics technology in the field of oncovirology.Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
