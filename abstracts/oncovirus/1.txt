Electronicaddress: carsten.muenk@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.Human myxovirus resistance protein B (hMXB) is a restriction factor of HIV-1 thatalso inhibits a variety of retroviruses. However, hMXB is not antiviral againstequine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). We show here that equine MX2 (eMX2)potently restricts EIAV in vitro. Additionally, eMX2 inhibits HIV-1 and otherlentiviruses, including murine leukemia virus. Previously, it was reported thathMXB repression is reduced in hMXB Δ1-25, but not in GTP-binding mutant K131A andGTP-hydrolysis mutant T151A. In contrast to this phenomenon, our study indicates that eMX2 restriction is not diminished in eMX2 Δ1-25, but is in eMX2 K127A andT147A, which correspond to hMXB K131A and T151A, respectively. Thus, eMX2 mayinhibit retroviral replication by a novel mechanism that differs from that ofhMXB.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
