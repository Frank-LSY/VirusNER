This coevolution may have contributed to the non-pathogenicity of FVs, an important factor in development of foamy viral vectors in gene therapy. However, various questions on the molecular evolution of FVs remain still unanswered. The analysis of the spectrum of animal species infected by exogenous FVs or harboringendogenous FV elements in their genome is pivotal. Furthermore, animal studiesmight reveal important issues, such as the identification of the FV in vivotarget cells, which than require a detailed characterization, to resolve themolecular basis of the accuracy with which FVs copy their genome. The issues ofthe extent of FV viremia and of the nature of the virion genome (RNA vs. DNA)also need to be experimentally addressed.DOI: 10.3390/v5102349 PMCID: PMC3814592PMID: 24072062  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
