Since the baboongenome harbors multiple copies of an endogenous oncovirus, chimericlenti-oncoviruses could emerge in the xenotransplant recipient. To analyze thepotential replication competence of hybrid viruses between different genera ofretroviruses, we replaced most of the env gene of simian immunodeficiency viruswith the env gene of an amphotropic murine leukemia virus. The hybrid virus couldbe propagated in human T-cell lines, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ofrhesus macaques, and in CD4- B-cell lines. Because of the expanded cell tropism, the hybrid virus might have a selective advantage in comparison to parentalviruses. Therefore, emerging chimeric viruses may be considered a serious risk ofxenotransplantation. A note of caution is also suggested for the use ofpseudotyped lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy.PMCID: PMC191473PMID: 9060704  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
