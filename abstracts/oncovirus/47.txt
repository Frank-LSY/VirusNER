Baboon bone marrow was grafted into human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected 
patients in the course of recent trials for AIDS treatment. Since the baboon
genome harbors multiple copies of an endogenous oncovirus, chimeric
lenti-oncoviruses could emerge in the xenotransplant recipient. To analyze the
potential replication competence of hybrid viruses between different genera of
retroviruses, we replaced most of the env gene of simian immunodeficiency virus
with the env gene of an amphotropic murine leukemia virus. The hybrid virus could
be propagated in human T-cell lines, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
rhesus macaques, and in CD4- B-cell lines. Because of the expanded cell tropism, 
the hybrid virus might have a selective advantage in comparison to parental
viruses. Therefore, emerging chimeric viruses may be considered a serious risk of
xenotransplantation. A note of caution is also suggested for the use of
pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy.
