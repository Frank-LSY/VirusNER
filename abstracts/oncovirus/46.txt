However, the use of HIV-1 vectors raises concerns about their safety.Here we describe a self-inactivating HIV-1 vector with a 400-nucleotide deletion in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). The deletion, which includes the TATA box, abolished the LTR promoter activity but did not affect vector titers or transgeneexpression in vitro. The self-inactivating vector transduced neurons in vivo asefficiently as a vector with full-length LTRs. The inactivation design achievedin this work improves significantly the biosafety of HIV-derived vectors, as itreduces the likelihood that replication-competent retroviruses will originate in the vector producer and target cells, and hampers recombination with wild-typeHIV in an infected host. Moreover, it improves the potential performance of thevector by removing LTR sequences previously associated with transcriptionalinterference and suppression in vivo and by allowing the construction ofmore-stringent tissue-specific or regulatable vectors.PMCID: PMC110499PMID: 9811723  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
