Jackson Foundation for theAdvancement of Military Medicine, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States ofAmerica.The development and verification of HIV-2 assays depends in part on theavailability of well-characterized samples, including those from reagentrepositories. During the development of an HIV-2 RNA quantification assay, twoHIV-2 viral isolates (CDC 301340 and CDC 301342) obtained from the NIAID AIDSReagent and Reference Repository were not detected leading to an investigation.Two HIV-2 primers/probe sets of known performance in real-time viral RNAquantification assays, targeting different regions of the virus, also failed togenerate RT-PCR products for these two isolates. These isolates were tested inthe HIV-1 specific COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test v2.0 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and were quantified at high copy number. Other HIV-2 isolates testedwere not amplified in the COBAS HIV-1 TaqMan assay. Furthermore, the discrepantisolates were highly reactive in an HIV-1 p24 antigen test while the other HIV-2 isolates showed very weak, if any, cross-reactivity with the HIV-1 p24 assay.Phylogenetic tree analysis of sequences from the protease-reverse transcriptaseregions of the discrepant HIV-2 isolates mapped with HIV-1 Group M, SubtypeCRF02_AG confirming these isolates were of HIV-1 origin and had beenmisclassified as HIV-2. The use of misclassified isolates in the verification of molecular and immunological assays can lead to misinterpretation of test results,misdirection of efforts into assay redesign and increased development costs. The results of this study were shared with the NIAID AIDS Reagent Program, leading tothe reclassification of the two discrepant isolates as HIV-1.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096554 PMCID: PMC4010467PMID: 24797800  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
