Cross-species transmission andadaptation of SIV to humans have given rise to human immunodeficiency viruses(HIV-1 and HIV-2) on twelve accountable, independent occasions. However, thedeterminants contributing to a simian-to-human lasting transmission are not fullyunderstood. Following entry, viral cores are released into the cytoplasm andbecome the principal target of host cellular factors. Here, we evaluated cellularfactors likely to be involved in potential new SIV cross-species transmissions.We investigated the interactions of capsids from naturally circulating SIVisolates with both HIV-1 restricting (i.e. TRIM5 proteins) and facilitating (i.e.cyclophilin A and nucleopore-associated Nup358/RanBP2 and Nup153) factors insingle-round infectivity assays that reproduce early stages of the virallife-cycle.RESULTS: We show that human TRIM5α is unlikely to prevent cross-speciestransmission of any SIV we tested and observed that the SIV CA-CypA interactionis a widespread but not a universal feature. Moreover, entry in the nucleus ofdifferent SIV appeared to follow pathways that do not necessarily recruitNup358/RanBP2 or Nup153, and this regardless of their interaction with CypA.Nevertheless, we found that, like HIV-1, human-adapted HIV-2 infection wasdependent on Nup358/RanBP2 and Nup153 interactions for optimal infection.Furthermore, we found that, unlike HIV CA, SIV CA did not require a directinteraction with the Cyp-like domain of Nup358/RanBP2 to carry out successfulinfection.CONCLUSIONS: Circulating SIV present a variety of phenotypes with regard toCA-interacting restricting or facilitating factors. Altogether, we unveiledunidentified pathways for SIV CA, which could also be exploited by HIV indifferent cellular contexts, to drive entry into the nucleus. Our findingswarrant a closer evaluation of other potential defenses against circulating SIV.DOI: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-77 PMCID: PMC3751554PMID: 23883001  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
