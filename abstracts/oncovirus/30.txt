OBJECTIVES: HIV-1 generates swarms of similar, but genetically distinct, variants
termed quasispecies and many of these variants can be defective. A relevant
question is whether such defective species can contribute to viral pathogenesis. 
Indeed, we previously reported that a presumed recombination of defective
proviral DNA with other complementary defective proviral DNA or with wild-type
viral DNA in the aftermath of superinfection could lead to the rescue of
defective provirus and the production of replication-competent virus. We then
wished to determine whether such rescue could be affected by viruses of different
subtypes or even by other members of the retrovirus family.
METHODS: Here, we have used drug resistance mutations within the HIV genome as
markers of potential recombination.
RESULTS: We show that a defective proviral DNA within cells can be rescued by the
superinfection of MT2 cells by various subtypes of HIV-1, and by HIV-2 and simian
immunodeficiency virus, but not by human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 or by
human herpes virus-6. The drug-resistance phenotype of the rescued HIV was
confirmed in a second round of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Defective proviral HIV-1 can be rescued by the infection by
different variants of HIV-1 and by several other retroviruses as well.
