A relevantquestion is whether such defective species can contribute to viral pathogenesis. Indeed, we previously reported that a presumed recombination of defectiveproviral DNA with other complementary defective proviral DNA or with wild-typeviral DNA in the aftermath of superinfection could lead to the rescue ofdefective provirus and the production of replication-competent virus. We thenwished to determine whether such rescue could be affected by viruses of differentsubtypes or even by other members of the retrovirus family.METHODS: Here, we have used drug resistance mutations within the HIV genome asmarkers of potential recombination.RESULTS: We show that a defective proviral DNA within cells can be rescued by thesuperinfection of MT2 cells by various subtypes of HIV-1, and by HIV-2 and simianimmunodeficiency virus, but not by human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 or byhuman herpes virus-6. The drug-resistance phenotype of the rescued HIV wasconfirmed in a second round of infection.CONCLUSIONS: Defective proviral HIV-1 can be rescued by the infection bydifferent variants of HIV-1 and by several other retroviruses as well.DOI: 10.1093/jac/dkt326 PMID: 23963235  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
