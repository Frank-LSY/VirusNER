Electronic address:antonia.follenzi@med.uniupo.it.Lentiviral vectors (LVs)-mediated gene transfer is an efficient method for exvivo and in vivo gene therapy. Actually, LVs have been used in several clinicaltrials and therapeutic correction was reached in affected patients. However, inorder to be effective gene therapy needs to be efficient without detrimentaleffects for target cells. Successful cell transduction by LVs can be hampered by several factors such as the activation of innate immune sensors during celltransduction and different restriction factors (RFs) inhibiting viral replicationinside the cells. Therefore, a better knowledge of host-vector interactions isimportant for the development of more efficient gene therapy strategies improvingthe LVs platform by limiting harmful responses.Copyright Â© 2016.
