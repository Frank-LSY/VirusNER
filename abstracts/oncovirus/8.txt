Detailed herein is a simple protocol for the production LVvectors, describing the triple transfection of an LV transfer vector and LVhelper plasmids into HEK-293 cells, and the subsequent purification of virionsfrom the cellular media. The current protocol is versatile, and can be easilymodified to fit the specific needs of the researcher in order to producerelatively high-titer LV vectors which can be used to transduce a wide variety ofcells both in vitro and in vivo.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3271-9_8 PMID: 26611582  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
