Models of viral population dynamics have contributed enormously to our
understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of several infectious
diseases, the coevolutionary dynamics of viruses and their hosts, the mechanisms 
of action of drugs, and the effectiveness of interventions. In this chapter, we
review major advances in the modeling of the population dynamics of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and briefly discuss adaptations to other viruses.
