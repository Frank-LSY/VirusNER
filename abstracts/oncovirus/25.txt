25. AIDS Rev. 2014 Jan-Mar;16(1):23-34.Origin and diversity of human retroviruses.Peeters M(1), D'Arc M, Delaporte E.Author information: (1)UMI 233, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and University ofMontpellier 1, Montpellier, France.Simian immunodeficiency viruses, simian T‑cell lymphotropic viruses, and simianfoamy viruses from nonhuman primates have crossed the species barrier to humansat several time points, leading to the HIV and human T lymphotropic virusepidemic and to sporadic cases of human infections with simian foamy viruses,respectively. Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between simianfoamy virus, simian lymphotropic virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, butseems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, asillustrated by the different spread of HIV‑1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV‑2groups. Among the four HIV‑1 groups, only HIV‑1 group M has spread worldwide, andthe actual diversity within HIV‑1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is theresult of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV‑2 onlyspread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV‑1, the nine HIV‑2 groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T lymphotropicvirus, type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simiancounterparts (simian T lymphotropic virus‑1, ‑2, ‑3) have been identified inmultiple nonhuman primate species. The majority of human infections are withhuman T lymphotropic virus‑1, which is present throughout the world as clustersof high endemicity. Humans are susceptible to a wide variety of simian foamyviruses and seem to acquire these viruses more readily than simianimmunodeficiency viruses or simian T lymphotropic viruses, but neither signs ofdisease in humans nor human‑to‑human transmission of simian foamy virus have beendocumented yet. The current HIV‑1 M epidemic illustrates the impact of a singlecross‑species transmission. The recent discovery of HIV‑1 P, HIV‑2 I, new human Tlymphotropic virus‑1 and ‑3 variants, as well as simian foamy virus infections inhumans in Central Africa, show that our knowledge of genetic diversity andcross‑species transmissions of simian retroviruses is still incomplete.PMCID: PMC4289907PMID: 24584106  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
