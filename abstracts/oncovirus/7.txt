In addition to the specific tRNAs that prime reversetranscription, all examined retroviruses selectively package multiple host cellnoncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Many of these ncRNAs appear to be encapsidated shortlyafter synthesis, before assembling with their normal protein partners.Remarkably, although some packaged ncRNAs, such as pre-tRNAs and the spliceosomalU6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), were believed to reside exclusively withinmammalian nuclei, it was demonstrated recently that the model retrovirus murineleukemia virus (MLV) packages these ncRNAs from a novel pathway in which unneedednascent ncRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for degradation. The finding thatretroviruses package forms of ncRNAs that are rare in cells suggests severalhypotheses for how these RNAs could assist retrovirus assembly and infectivity.Moreover, recent experiments in several laboratories have identified additionalways in which cellular ncRNAs may contribute to the retrovirus life cycle. Thisreview focuses on the ncRNAs that are packaged by retroviruses and the ways inwhich both encapsidated ncRNAs and other cellular ncRNAs may contribute toretrovirus replication.Copyright Â© 2016 Eckwahl et al.DOI: 10.1128/mBio.02025-15 PMCID: PMC4752605PMID: 26861021  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
