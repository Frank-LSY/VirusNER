Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;790:128-49. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-7651-1_7.Cellular entry of retroviruses.Lindemann D(1), Steffen I, Pöhlmann S.Author information: (1)Institute for Virology, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.The retrovirus family contains several important human and animal pathogens,including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Studies with retroviruses were instrumental to our present understanding of the cellular entry of enveloped viruses in general. For instance, studies with alpharetroviruses defined receptor engagement, asopposed to low pH, as a trigger for the envelope protein-driven membrane fusion. The insights into the retroviral entry process allowed the generation of a newclass of antivirals, entry inhibitors, and these therapeutics are at present usedfor treatment of HIV/AIDS. In this chapter, we will summarize key conceptsestablished for entry of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV), a widely usedmodel system for retroviral entry. We will then review how foamy virus and HIV,primate- and human retroviruses, enter target cells, and how the interaction ofthe viral and cellular factors involved in the cellular entry of these virusesimpacts viral tropism, pathogenesis and approaches to therapy and vaccinedevelopment.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4614-7651-1_7 PMID: 23884589  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
