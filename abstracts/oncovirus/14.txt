Pathogens such as HIV-1, with their minimalist genomes, must navigate cellular
networks and rely on hijacking and manipulating the host machinery for successful
replication. Limited overlap of host factors identified as vital for pathogen
replication may be explained by considering that pathogens target, rather than
specific cellular factors, crucial cellular pathways by targeting different,
functionally equivalent, protein-protein interactions within that pathway. The
ability to utilize alternative routes through cellular pathways may be essential 
for pathogen survival when restricted and provide flexibility depending on the
viral replication stage and the environment in the infected host. In this
minireview, we evaluate evidence supporting this notion, discuss specific HIV-1
examples, and consider the molecular mechanisms which allow pathogens to flexibly
exploit different routes.
