Epub 2015 Mar 11.The Road Less Traveled: HIV's Use of Alternative Routes through CellularPathways.Marx A(1), Alian A(2).Author information: (1)Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.(2)Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israelalian@tx.technion.ac.il.Pathogens such as HIV-1, with their minimalist genomes, must navigate cellularnetworks and rely on hijacking and manipulating the host machinery for successfulreplication. Limited overlap of host factors identified as vital for pathogenreplication may be explained by considering that pathogens target, rather thanspecific cellular factors, crucial cellular pathways by targeting different,functionally equivalent, protein-protein interactions within that pathway. Theability to utilize alternative routes through cellular pathways may be essential for pathogen survival when restricted and provide flexibility depending on theviral replication stage and the environment in the infected host. In thisminireview, we evaluate evidence supporting this notion, discuss specific HIV-1examples, and consider the molecular mechanisms which allow pathogens to flexiblyexploit different routes.Copyright Â© 2015, American Society for Microbiology.
