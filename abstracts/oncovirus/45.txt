Primate lentiviruses encode a small protein designated Nef that has been shown to
be a major determinant of virus pathogenicity. Nef regulates multiple host
factors in order to optimize the cellular environment for virus replication. The 
mechanisms by which this small protein modulates distinct host cell properties
provide intriguing insight into the intricate interaction between virus and host.
