Previous work has correlated the deoxynucleotidetriphosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 with its ability to block HIV-1 andSIV(mac) infection. SAMHD1 is comprised of the sterile alpha motif (SAM) andhistidine-aspartic (HD) domains; however the contribution of these domains toretroviral restriction is not understood. Mutagenesis and deletion studiesrevealed that expression of the sole HD domain of SAMHD1 is sufficient to achievepotent restriction of HIV-1 and SIV(mac). We demonstrated that the HD domain ofSAMHD1 is essential for the ability of SAMHD1 to oligomerize by using abiochemical assay. In agreement with previous observations, we mapped theRNA-binding ability of SAMHD1 to the HD domain. We also demonstrated a directinteraction of SAMHD1 with RNA by using enzymatically-active purified SAMHD1protein from insect cells. Interestingly, we showed that double-stranded RNAinhibits the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 in vitro suggesting the possibilitythat RNA from a pathogen might modulate the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 incells. By contrast, we found that the SAM domain is dispensable for retroviralrestriction, oligomerization and RNA binding. Finally we tested the ability ofSAMHD1 to block the infection of retroviruses other than HIV-1 and SIV(mac).These results showed that SAMHD1 blocks infection of HIV-2, felineimmunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), Equineinfectious anemia virus (EIAV), N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), andB-tropic murine leukemia virus (B-MLV).Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
