Exposure to blood or othersecretions of infected animals, through hunting and butchering of bushmeat, orthrough bites and scratches inflicted by pet nonhuman primates (NHPs), represent the most plausible source for human infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) and simian foamy virus. The chancefor cross-species transmissions could increase when frequency of exposure andretrovirus prevalence is high. According to the most recent data, human exposure to SIV or STLV appears heterogeneous across the African countries surveyed.Exposure is not sufficient to trigger disease: viral and host molecularcharacteristics and compatibility are fundamental factors to establish infection.A successful species jump is achieved when the pathogen becomes transmissiblebetween individuals within the new host population. To spread efficiently, HIVlikely required changes in human behavior. Given the increasing exposure to NHPpathogens through hunting and butchering, it is likely that SIV and other simian viruses are still transmitted to the human population. The behavioral andsocio-economic context of the twenty-first century provides favorable conditions for the emergence and spread of new epidemics. Therefore, it is important toevaluate which retroviruses the human population is exposed to and to betterunderstand how these viruses enter, infect, adapt and spread to its new host.DOI: 10.1097/QAD.0b013e328350fb68 PMID: 22441170  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
