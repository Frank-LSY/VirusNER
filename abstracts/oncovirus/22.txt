Retroviral replication proceeds through an obligate integrated DNA provirus,
making retroviral vectors attractive vehicles for human gene-therapy. Though most
of the host cell genome is available for integration, the process of integration 
site selection is not random. Retroviruses differ in their choice of
chromatin-associated features and also prefer particular nucleotide sequences at 
the point of insertion. Lentiviruses including HIV-1 preferentially integrate
within the bodies of active genes, whereas the prototypical gammaretrovirus
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) favors strong enhancers and active gene
promoter regions. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, and
recent research has demonstrated that HIV-1 and MoMLV targeting preferences are
in large part guided by integrase-interacting host factors (LEDGF/p75 for HIV-1
and BET proteins for MoMLV) that tether viral intasomes to chromatin. In each
case, the selectivity of epigenetic marks on histones recognized by the protein
tether helps to determine the integration distribution. In contrast, nucleotide
preferences at integration sites seem to be governed by the ability for the
integrase protein to locally bend the DNA duplex for pairwise insertion of the
viral DNA ends. We discuss approaches to alter integration site selection that
could potentially improve the safety of retroviral vectors in the clinic.
