Though mostof the host cell genome is available for integration, the process of integration site selection is not random. Retroviruses differ in their choice ofchromatin-associated features and also prefer particular nucleotide sequences at the point of insertion. Lentiviruses including HIV-1 preferentially integratewithin the bodies of active genes, whereas the prototypical gammaretrovirusMoloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) favors strong enhancers and active genepromoter regions. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, andrecent research has demonstrated that HIV-1 and MoMLV targeting preferences arein large part guided by integrase-interacting host factors (LEDGF/p75 for HIV-1and BET proteins for MoMLV) that tether viral intasomes to chromatin. In eachcase, the selectivity of epigenetic marks on histones recognized by the proteintether helps to determine the integration distribution. In contrast, nucleotidepreferences at integration sites seem to be governed by the ability for theintegrase protein to locally bend the DNA duplex for pairwise insertion of theviral DNA ends. We discuss approaches to alter integration site selection thatcould potentially improve the safety of retroviral vectors in the clinic.Â© The Author(s) 2014.
