In this report we review the 2014 anniversary conference to sharethe meeting summary with the virology community and hope to arouse interest byother researchers to join this exciting field. The topics covered includedepidemiology, virus molecular biology, and immunology of FV infection innon-human primates, cattle, and humans with zoonotic FV infections, as well asrecent findings on endogenous FVs. Several topics focused on virus replicationand interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Use of FV in biomedicalresearch was highlighted with presentations on using FV vectors for gene therapy and FV proteins as scaffold for vaccine antigen presentation. On behalf of the FVcommunity, this report also includes a short tribute to commemorate Prof. AxelRethwilm, one of the leading experts in the field of retrovirology and foamyviruses, who passed away 29 July 2014.DOI: 10.3390/v7041651 PMCID: PMC4411671PMID: 25835535  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
