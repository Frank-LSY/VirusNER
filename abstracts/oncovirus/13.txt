For the past two decades, scientists from around the world, working on different 
aspects of foamy virus (FV) research, have gathered in different research
institutions almost every two years to present their recent results in formal
talks, to discuss their ongoing studies informally, and to initiate fruitful
collaborations. In this report we review the 2014 anniversary conference to share
the meeting summary with the virology community and hope to arouse interest by
other researchers to join this exciting field. The topics covered included
epidemiology, virus molecular biology, and immunology of FV infection in
non-human primates, cattle, and humans with zoonotic FV infections, as well as
recent findings on endogenous FVs. Several topics focused on virus replication
and interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Use of FV in biomedical
research was highlighted with presentations on using FV vectors for gene therapy 
and FV proteins as scaffold for vaccine antigen presentation. On behalf of the FV
community, this report also includes a short tribute to commemorate Prof. Axel
Rethwilm, one of the leading experts in the field of retrovirology and foamy
viruses, who passed away 29 July 2014.
