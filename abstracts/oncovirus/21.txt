Both of these viruses limitproduction and can be a major source of economic loss to producers. Little isknown about how the immune system recognizes and responds to SRLVs, but due tosimilarities with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV research can shedlight on the possible immune mechanisms that control or lead to diseaseprogression. This review will focus on the host immune response to HIV-1 andSRLV, and will discuss the possibility of breeding for enhanced SRLV diseaseresistance.DOI: 10.3390/v6083311 PMCID: PMC4147697PMID: 25153344  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
