The small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) include the caprine arthritis encephalitis
virus (CAEV) and the Maedi-Visna virus (MVV). Both of these viruses limit
production and can be a major source of economic loss to producers. Little is
known about how the immune system recognizes and responds to SRLVs, but due to
similarities with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV research can shed
light on the possible immune mechanisms that control or lead to disease
progression. This review will focus on the host immune response to HIV-1 and
SRLV, and will discuss the possibility of breeding for enhanced SRLV disease
resistance.
