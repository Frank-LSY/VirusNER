Studies on HIV virology and pathogenesis address the complex mechanisms that
result in the HIV infection of the cell and destruction of the immune system.
These studies are focused on both the structure and the replication
characteristics of HIV and on the interaction of the virus with the host.
Continuous updating of knowledge on structure, variability and replication of
HIV, as well as the characteristics of the host immune response, are essential to
refine virological and immunological mechanisms associated with the viral
infection and allow us to identify key molecules in the virus life cycle that can
be important for the design of new diagnostic assays and specific antiviral drugs
and vaccines. In this article we review the characteristics of molecular
structure, replication and pathogenesis of HIV, with a particular focus on those 
aspects that are important for the design of diagnostic assays.
