vivo characterization.

Rabbit corneal cells transformed by a putative human type-C helper virus
pseudotype of the mouse sarcoma virus produce large amounts of transforming and
non-transforming viruses. The virions are antigenically related to the woolly
monkey (simian) sarcoma-leukemia type-C oncovirus. Typical sarcoma virus lesions 
developed in newborn rats injected with virus-producing rabbit cells. Cells
producing only the putative type-C helper viruses as a result of exposure to a
high dilution of transforming virus stock induce lymphosarcomas after inoculation
into newborn rats.
