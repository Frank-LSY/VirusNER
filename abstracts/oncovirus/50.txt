Int J Cancer. 1978 Jan 15;21(1):27-34.Type-C oncovirus isolate from human leukemic bone marrow: further in vitro and invivo characterization.Nooter K, Overdevest J, Dubbes R, Koch G, Bentvelzen P, Zurcher C, Coolen J,Calafat J.Rabbit corneal cells transformed by a putative human type-C helper viruspseudotype of the mouse sarcoma virus produce large amounts of transforming andnon-transforming viruses. The virions are antigenically related to the woollymonkey (simian) sarcoma-leukemia type-C oncovirus. Typical sarcoma virus lesions developed in newborn rats injected with virus-producing rabbit cells. Cellsproducing only the putative type-C helper viruses as a result of exposure to ahigh dilution of transforming virus stock induce lymphosarcomas after inoculationinto newborn rats.PMID: 203541  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
