The RNA genome of retroviruses is encased within a protein capsid. To gather
insight into the assembly and function of this capsid, we used electron
cryotomography to image human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and equine infectious 
anemia virus (EIAV) particles. While the majority of viral cores appeared closed,
a variety of unclosed structures including rolled sheets, extra flaps, and cores 
with holes in the tip were also seen. Simulations of nonequilibrium growth of
elastic sheets recapitulated each of these aberrations and further predicted the 
occasional presence of seams, for which tentative evidence was also found within 
the cryotomograms. To test the integrity of viral capsids in vivo, we observed
that ~25% of cytoplasmic HIV complexes captured by TRIM5α had holes large enough 
to allow internal green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules to escape. Together, 
these findings suggest that HIV assembly at least sometimes involves the union in
space of two edges of a curling sheet and results in a substantial number of
unclosed forms.
