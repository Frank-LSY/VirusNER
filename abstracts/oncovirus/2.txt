Recentresearch has led to the identification of previously unknown exogenous foamyviruses, and to the discovery of endogenous spumaretrovirus sequences in avariety of host genomes. Here, we describe an updated spumaretrovirus taxonomythat has been recently accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy ofViruses (ICTV) Executive Committee, and describe a virus nomenclature that isgenerally consistent with that used for other retroviruses, such as lentiviruses and deltaretroviruses. This taxonomy can be applied to distinguish different, butclosely related, primate (e.g., human, ape, simian) foamy viruses as well asthose from other hosts. This proposal accounts for host-virus co-speciation andcross-species transmission.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.035 PMID: 29407373  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
