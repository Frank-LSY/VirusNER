Electronic address: chen.liang@mcgill.ca.Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit the entry of a largenumber of viruses. Not surprisingly, many viruses are refractory to thisinhibition. In this study, we report that different strains of HIV and SIV areinhibited by human IFITM proteins to various degrees, with SIV of African greenmonkeys (SIV(AGM)) being mostly restricted by human IFITM2. Interestingly,SIV(AGM) is as much inhibited by human IFITM2 as by IFITM3 of its own hostAfrican green monkeys. Our data further demonstrate that the entry of SIV(AGM) isimpaired by human IFITM2 and that this inhibition is overcome by thecholesterol-binding compound amphotericin B that also overcomes IFITM inhibition of influenza A viruses. These results suggest that IFITM proteins exploit similarmechanisms to inhibit the entry of both pH-independent primate lentiviruses andthe pH-dependent influenza A viruses.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
