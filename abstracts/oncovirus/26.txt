We identified RNA-associatedEarly-stage Anti-viral Factor (REAF) using a whole genome siRNA screen forrestriction factors to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that act in the earlyphase of viral replication.RESULTS: We observed more than 50 fold rescue of HIV-1 infection, using a focusforming unit (FFU) assay, following knockdown of REAF by specific siRNA.Quantitative PCR was used to show that REAF knockdown results in an increase ofearly and late reverse transcripts which impacts the level of integration. REAFthus appears to act at an early stage of the viral life cycle during reversetranscription. Conversely when REAF is over-expressed in target cells lessinfected cells are detectable and fewer reverse transcripts are produced. HumanREAF can also inhibit HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection.REAF associates with viral nucleic acids and may act to prevent reversetranscription.CONCLUSIONS: This report firmly places REAF alongside APOBECs and SAMHD1 as apotent inhibitor of HIV replication acting early in the replication cycle, justafter cell entry. We propose that REAF is part of an anti-viral surveillancesystem destroying incoming retroviruses. This novel mechanism could apply toinvasion of cells by any intracellular pathogen.DOI: 10.1186/1742-4690-11-3 PMCID: PMC3895926PMID: 24410916  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
