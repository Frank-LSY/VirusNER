The etiological agent of AIDS, LAV/HTLV-III, is common in Central Africa but is
not endemic in other areas of that continent. A novel human retrovirus, distinct 
from LAV/HTLV-III, has now been isolated from two AIDS patients from West Africa.
Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological and
morphological properties very similar to LAV but that it differs in some of its
antigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, 
the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelope
glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized
by serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termed
STLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closely
related to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAV
subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to 
as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac.
