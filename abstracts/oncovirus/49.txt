A novel human retrovirus, distinct from LAV/HTLV-III, has now been isolated from two AIDS patients from West Africa.Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological andmorphological properties very similar to LAV but that it differs in some of itsantigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelopeglycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognizedby serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termedSTLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closelyrelated to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAVsubgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac.PMID: 2425430  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
