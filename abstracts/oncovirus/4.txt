Electronic address: baiy@uthscsa.edu.Mitochondria play important roles in multiple aspects of viral tumorigenesis.Mitochondrial genomes contribute to the host's genetic background. After viruses enter the cell, they modulate mitochondrial function and thus alter bioenergeticsand retrograde signaling pathways. At the same time, mitochondria also regulateand mediate viral oncogenesis. In this context, oncogenesis by oncoviruses likeHepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human papilloma virus (HPV),Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will bediscussed.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.
