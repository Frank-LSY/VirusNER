Mitochondria play important roles in multiple aspects of viral tumorigenesis.
Mitochondrial genomes contribute to the host's genetic background. After viruses 
enter the cell, they modulate mitochondrial function and thus alter bioenergetics
and retrograde signaling pathways. At the same time, mitochondria also regulate
and mediate viral oncogenesis. In this context, oncogenesis by oncoviruses like
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human papilloma virus (HPV),
Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will be
discussed.
