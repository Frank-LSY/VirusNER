Epub 2012 Dec 5.Betaretroviral envelope subunits are noncovalently associated and restricted tothe mammalian class.Henzy JE(1), Coffin JM.Author information: (1)Tufts University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Biology andMicrobiology, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.The structure of the transmembrane subunit (TM) of the retroviral envelopeglycoprotein (Env) is highly conserved among most retrovirus genera and includes a pair of cysteines that forms an intramolecular disulfide loop within theectodomain. Alpha-, gamma-, and deltaretroviruses have a third cysteine, adjacentto the loop, which forms a disulfide bond between TM and the surface subunit (SU)of Env, while lentiviruses, which have noncovalently associated subunits, lackthis third cysteine. The Betaretrovirus genus includes Jaagsiekte sheepretrovirus (JSRV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), as well as manyendogenous retroviruses. Envelope subunit association had not been characterized in the betaretroviruses, but lack of a third cysteine in the TM ectodomainsuggested noncovalently associated subunits. We tested the Env proteins of JSRVand MMTV, as well as human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K)108--abetaretrovirus-like human endogenous retrovirus--for intersubunit bonding andfound that, as in the lentiviruses, the Env subunits lack an intersubunitdisulfide bond. Since these results suggest that the number of cysteines in theTM loop region readily distinguishes between covalent and noncovalent structure, we surveyed endogenous retroviral TM sequences in the genomes of vertebratesrepresented in public databases and found that (i) retroviruses withnoncovalently associated subunits have been present during all of anthropoidevolution and (ii) the noncovalent env motif is limited to mammals, while thecovalent type is found among five vertebrate classes. We discuss implications of these findings for retroviral evolution, cross-species transmissions, andrecombination events involving the env gene.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.01442-12 PMCID: PMC3571459PMID: 23221553  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
