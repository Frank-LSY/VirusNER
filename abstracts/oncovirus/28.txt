Retroviral glycoproteins are the prototypical system to study pH-independentviral entry. In this study, we determined crystal structures of extramembraneregions of the TMs from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and xenotropic murineleukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) at 1.7-Å and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively. The structures are comprised of a trimer of hairpins that is characteristic ofclass I viral fusion proteins and now completes a structural library ofretroviral fusion proteins. Our results allowed us to identify a series of intra-and interchain electrostatic interactions in the heptad repeat and chain reversalregions. Mutagenesis reveals that charge-neutralizing salt bridge mutationssignificantly destabilize the postfusion six-helix bundle and abrogate retroviralinfection, demonstrating that electrostatic stapling of the fusion subunit isessential for viral entry. Our data indicate that salt bridges are a majorstabilizing force on the MPMV and XMRV retroviral TMs and likely provide the key energetics for viral and host membrane fusion.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.02023-13 PMCID: PMC3911763PMID: 24131724  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
