Membrane fusion is a key step in the life cycle of all envelope viruses, but this
process is energetically unfavorable; the transmembrane fusion subunit (TM) of
the virion-attached glycoprotein actively catalyzes the membrane merger process. 
Retroviral glycoproteins are the prototypical system to study pH-independent
viral entry. In this study, we determined crystal structures of extramembrane
regions of the TMs from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and xenotropic murine
leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) at 1.7-Å and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively. 
The structures are comprised of a trimer of hairpins that is characteristic of
class I viral fusion proteins and now completes a structural library of
retroviral fusion proteins. Our results allowed us to identify a series of intra-
and interchain electrostatic interactions in the heptad repeat and chain reversal
regions. Mutagenesis reveals that charge-neutralizing salt bridge mutations
significantly destabilize the postfusion six-helix bundle and abrogate retroviral
infection, demonstrating that electrostatic stapling of the fusion subunit is
essential for viral entry. Our data indicate that salt bridges are a major
stabilizing force on the MPMV and XMRV retroviral TMs and likely provide the key 
energetics for viral and host membrane fusion.
