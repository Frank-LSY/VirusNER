FVs have found a completely new way to propagate their genome. And they do this extremely successfully because most of wild non-humanprimates, felines, bovines, equines, and small ruminants are likely to benon-pathogenically infected. The success of FVs can also be viewed from adifferent angle, since they replicate very conservatively and do not need toshape their genotypic and phenotypic makeup every now and then. The elucidationof the underlying basic mechanisms of the FV replication strategy is the topic ofthis review.DOI: 10.1007/s00430-010-0158-x PMID: 20445989  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
