One of the most fascinating areas in retrovirology is the study of foamy viruses 
(FVs), because these viruses appear to do everything that is common to all other 
retroviruses differently. FVs have found a completely new way to propagate their 
genome. And they do this extremely successfully because most of wild non-human
primates, felines, bovines, equines, and small ruminants are likely to be
non-pathogenically infected. The success of FVs can also be viewed from a
different angle, since they replicate very conservatively and do not need to
shape their genotypic and phenotypic makeup every now and then. The elucidation
of the underlying basic mechanisms of the FV replication strategy is the topic of
this review.
