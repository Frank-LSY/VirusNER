Numerous studied were conducted to understand the involvement ofthe three cardinal retroviral enzymes, reverse transcriptase, integrase andprotease, in the life cycle of the viruses. These studies have led to thedevelopment of many inhibitors of these enzymes as anti-retroviral specific drugsthat are used for routine treatments of HIV/AIDS patients. Interestingly, afourth virus-encoded enzyme, the deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase(dUTPase) is also found in several major retroviral groups. The presence and the importance of this enzyme to the life cycle of retroviruses were usuallyoverlooked by most retrovirologists, although the occurrence of dUTPases,particularly in beta-retroviruses and in non-primate retroviruses, is known formore than 20 years. Only more recently, retroviral dUTPases were brought into thelimelight and were shown in several cases to be essential for viral replication. Therefore, it is likely that future studies on this enzyme will advance ourknowledge to a level that will allow designing novel, specific and potentanti-dUTPase drugs that are effective in combating retroviral diseases. The aimof this review is to give concise background information on dUTPases in generaland to summarize the most relevant data on retroviral dUTPases and theirinvolvement in the replication processes and pathogenicity of the viruses, aswell as in possibly-associated human diseases.DOI: 10.1186/s12977-015-0198-9 PMCID: PMC4531489PMID: 26259899  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
