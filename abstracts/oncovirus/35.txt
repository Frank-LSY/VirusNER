However, the function of PARP-1 in retroviral DNA integration is controversial, probably due to thefunctional redundancy of the PARP family in mammalian cells. We evaluated thefunction of PARP-1 in retroviral infection using the chicken B lymphoblastoidcell line DT40. These cells lack significant PARP-1 functional redundancy andefficiently support the postentry early events of the mammalian-retrovirusreplication cycle. We observed that DT40 PARP-1(-/-) cells were 9- and 6-foldmore susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- andmurine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived viral vectors, respectively, than cellsexpressing PARP-1. Production of avian Rous-associated virus type 1 was alsoimpaired by PARP-1. However, the susceptibilities of these cell lines toinfection by the nonretrovirus vesicular stomatitis virus were indistinguishable.Real-time PCR analysis of the HIV-1 life cycle demonstrated that PARP-1 did notimpair reverse transcription, nuclear import of the preintegration complex, orviral DNA integration, suggesting that PARP-1 regulates a postintegration step.In support of this hypothesis, pharmacological inhibition of the epigeneticmechanism of transcriptional silencing increased retroviral expression inPARP-1-expressing cells, suppressing the differences observed. Further analysisof the implicated molecular mechanism indicated that PARP-1-mediated retroviralsilencing requires the C-terminal region, but not the enzymatic activity, of the protein. In sum, our data indicate a novel role of PARP-1 in the transcriptional repression of integrated retroviruses.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.01668-12 PMCID: PMC3571415PMID: 23255787  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
