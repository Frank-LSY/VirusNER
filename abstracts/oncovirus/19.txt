To capture essential features ofmucosal transmission of clade C viruses, we produced a series of SHIVs with earlyclade C HIV-1 env sequences from acutely HIV-1-infected individuals from SouthAfrica. SHIV-327c and SHIV-327cRM expressed env sequences that were 99.7 to 100% identical to the original HIV-1 isolate and did not require in vivo passaging formucosal infectivity. These challenge stocks infected rhesus monkeys efficientlyby both intrarectal and intravaginal routes, replicated to high levels duringacute infection, and established chronic setpoint viremia in 13 of 17 (76%)infected animals. The SHIV-327cRM challenge stock was also titrated for bothsingle, high-dose intrarectal challenges and repetitive, low-dose intrarectalchallenges in rhesus monkeys. These SHIV challenge stocks should facilitate thepreclinical evaluation of vaccines and other interventions aimed at preventingclade C HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCE: We describe the development of two relatedclade C SHIV challenge stocks. These challenge stocks should prove useful forpreclinical testing of vaccines and other interventions aimed at preventing cladeC HIV-1 infection.Copyright Â© 2015, American Society for Microbiology.
