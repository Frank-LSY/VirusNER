However, the detailed mechanism of the enhancement of viralinfectivity by Nef remains unclear. Additionally, studies of mechanisms by which Nef enhances the infectivity of SIV are not as intensive as those of HIV-1.METHODS: We generated short-lived Nef constructed by fusing Nef to aproteasome-mediated protein degradation sequence to characterize the Nef role in viral infectivity.RESULTS: The apparent expression level of the short-lived Nef was found to beextremely lower than that of the wild-type Nef. Moreover, the expression level ofthe short-lived Nef increased with the treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Theinfectivity of HIV-1 with the short-lived Nef was significantly lower than thatwith the wild-type Nef. On the other hand, the short-lived Nef enhanced theinfectivity of SIVmac239, an ability observed to be interestingly equivalent tothat of the wild-type Nef. The short-lived Nef was not detected in SIVmac239, butthe wild-type Nef was, suggesting that the incorporation of Nef into SIVmac239 isnot important for the enhancement of SIVmac239 infectivity.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the findings suggest that the mechanisms of infectivity enhancement by Nef are different between HIV-1 and SIVmac239. Lastly, we propose the following hypothesis: even when the expression level of a protein isextremely low, the protein may still be sufficiently functional.DOI: 10.1186/s12985-014-0222-z PMCID: PMC4310179PMID: 25519983  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
