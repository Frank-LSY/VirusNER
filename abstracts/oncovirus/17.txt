Here we use recenttechnological advances to infer broad patterns in retroviral diversity,evolution, and host-virus relationships by using a large-scale phylogenomicapproach using endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Retroviruses insert a proviral DNAcopy into the host cell genome to produce new viruses. ERVs are provirusinsertions in germline cells that are inherited down the host lineage andconsequently present a record of past host-viral associations. By mining ERVsfrom 65 host genomes sampled across vertebrate diversity, we uncover a greatdiversity of ERVs, indicating that retroviral sequences are much more prevalentand widespread across vertebrates than previously appreciated. The majority ofERV clades that we recover do not contain known retroviruses, implying eitherthat retroviral lineages are highly transient over evolutionary time or that aconsiderable number of retroviruses remain to be identified. By characterizingthe distribution of ERVs, we show that no major vertebrate lineage has escapedretroviral activity and that retroviruses are extreme host generalists, having anunprecedented ability for rampant host switching among distantly relatedvertebrates. In addition, we examine whether the distribution of ERVs can beexplained by host factors predicted to influence viral transmission and find thatinternal fertilization has a pronounced effect on retroviral colonization of hostgenomes. By capturing the mode and pattern of retroviral evolution andcontrasting ERV diversity with known retroviral diversity, our study provides acohesive framework to understand host-virus coevolution better.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1414980112 PMCID: PMC4299219PMID: 25535393  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
