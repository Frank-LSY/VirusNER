The glycoproteins from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) were resistant to the antiviral effects of all three lectins. Forgammaretroviruses, CV-N inhibited entry mediated by some but not all of theenvelopes examined, whereas GRFT and SVN displayed only little or no effect.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.02553-13 PMCID: PMC3911537PMID: 24284326  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
