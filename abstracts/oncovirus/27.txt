The antiviral lectins griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin-N (CV-N), and scytovirin
(SVN), which inhibit several enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses, were
examined for their ability to inhibit entry mediated by Env proteins of delta-
and gammaretroviruses. The glycoproteins from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 
(HTLV-1) were resistant to the antiviral effects of all three lectins. For
gammaretroviruses, CV-N inhibited entry mediated by some but not all of the
envelopes examined, whereas GRFT and SVN displayed only little or no effect.
