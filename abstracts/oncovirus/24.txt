We analyzed genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among 124 HIV-1 and 
19 HIV-2 strains in sera collected in 1986 from patients of the state hospital in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 env gp41 region of 
65 sequences characterized 37 (56.9%) as CRF06_cpx strains, 25 (38.5%) as
CRF02_AG, 2 (3.1%) as CRF09_cpx, and 1 (1.5%) as subtype A. Similarly,
phylogenetic analysis of the protease (PR) gene region of 73 sequences identified
52 (71.2%) as CRF06_cpx, 15 (20.5%) as CRF02_AG, 5 (6.8%) as subtype A, and 1
(1.4%) was a unique strain that clustered along the B/D lineage but basal to the 
node connecting the two lineages. HIV-2 PR or integrase (INT) groups A (n = 17
[89.5%]) and B (n = 2 [10.5%]) were found in both monotypic (n = 11) and
heterotypic HIV-1/HIV-2 (n = 8) infections, with few HIV-2 group B infections.
Based on limited available sampling, evidence suggests two recombinant viruses,
CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG, appear to have driven the beginning of the mid-1980s
HIV-1 epidemic in Burkina Faso.
