The HIV-1 RNA genome contains complex structures with many structural elements
playing regulatory roles during viral replication. A recent study has identified 
multiple RNA structures with unknown functions that are conserved among HIV-1 and
two simian immunodeficiency viruses. To explore the roles of these conserved RNA 
structures, we introduced synonymous mutations into the HIV-1 genome to disrupt
each structure. These mutants exhibited similar particle production, viral
infectivity, and replication kinetics relative to the parent NL4-3 virus.
However, when replicating in direct competition with the wild-type NL4-3 virus,
mutations of RNA structures at inter-protein domain junctions can cause fitness
defects. These findings reveal the ability of HIV-1 to tolerate changes in its
sequences, even in apparently highly conserved structures, which permits high
genetic diversity in HIV-1 population. Our results also suggest that some
conserved RNA structures may function to fine-tune viral replication.
