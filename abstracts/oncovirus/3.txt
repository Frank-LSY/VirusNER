Electronic address:Wei-Shau.Hu@nih.gov.The HIV-1 RNA genome contains complex structures with many structural elementsplaying regulatory roles during viral replication. A recent study has identified multiple RNA structures with unknown functions that are conserved among HIV-1 andtwo simian immunodeficiency viruses. To explore the roles of these conserved RNA structures, we introduced synonymous mutations into the HIV-1 genome to disrupteach structure. These mutants exhibited similar particle production, viralinfectivity, and replication kinetics relative to the parent NL4-3 virus.However, when replicating in direct competition with the wild-type NL4-3 virus,mutations of RNA structures at inter-protein domain junctions can cause fitnessdefects. These findings reveal the ability of HIV-1 to tolerate changes in itssequences, even in apparently highly conserved structures, which permits highgenetic diversity in HIV-1 population. Our results also suggest that someconserved RNA structures may function to fine-tune viral replication.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.virol.2017.10.020 PMCID: PMC5766380PMID: 29128752  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
