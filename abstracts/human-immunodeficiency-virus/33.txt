The advent of antiretroviral therapy has transformed infection by the type 1
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a rapidly fatal disease to a chronic
illness with excellent long-term survival rates. Although HIV primarily targets
the adaptive arm of host immunity, it simultaneously impacts the innate immune
system, and has profound implications for lung health, even when viral
suppression is achieved with antiretroviral therapy. The lung has evolved a
unique array of innate immune defenses, and the pathophysiological interactions
between HIV and the pulmonary innate immune system deserve particular attention. 
In this review, we discuss work that elucidates how the components of innate
immunity both respond to and are perturbed by infection with HIV.
