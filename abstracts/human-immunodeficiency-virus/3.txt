Superinfection is frequently detected among individuals infected by human
immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). Superinfection occurs at similar
frequencies at acute and chronic infection stages but less frequently than
primary infection. This observation indicates that the immune responses elicited 
by natural HIV-1 infection may play a role in curb of superinfection; however,
these responses are not sufficiently strong to completely prevent superinfection.
Thus, a successful HIV-1 vaccine likely needs to induce more potent and broader
immune responses than those elicited by primary infection. On the other hand,
potent and broad neutralization responses are more often detected after
superinfection than during monoinfection. This suggests that broadly neutralizing
antibodies are more likely induced by sequential immunization of multiple
different immunogens than with only one form of envelope glycoprotein immunogens.
Understanding why the protection from superinfection by immunity induced by
primary infection is insufficient and if superinfection can lead to
cross-reactive immune responses will be highly informative for HIV-1 vaccine
design.
