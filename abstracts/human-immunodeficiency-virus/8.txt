BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases remain a major concern
for blood safety, particularly with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus
(HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nucleic acid testing (NAT) in
donor screening shortens the serologically negative window period and reduces
virus transmission. The cobas MPX (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, New
Jersey) is a recently developed multiplex qualitative PCR system that enables the
simultaneous detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV with improved sensitivity and
throughput using cobas 6800 and 8800 instruments.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct an evaluation of the clinical
sensitivity and specificity of cobas MPX detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV in
clinical specimens.
STUDY DESIGN: Among samples referred for HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 quantification at
Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, positive samples were 
selected to evaluate sensitivity. A total of 843 samples was tested using both
cobas MPX and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan Tests for HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 using
the cobas 8800 system and a COBAS TaqMan 96 analyzer, respectively. Samples that 
showed discrepancies were confirmed by nested PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: The cobas MPX achieved excellent sensitivity and specificity for the
detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 in clinical samples. We found that the lower
limit of detection (LOD) of blood screening by NAT actually improves clinical
sensitivity, and occult HBV infection prevalence among healthy employees of the
hospital was rather high.
