As treatment options coalesce around a smaller number of antiretroviral drugs
(ARVs), data are emerging on the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) selected by the
most widely used ARVs and on the impact of these DRMs on ARV susceptibility and
virological response to first- and later-line treatment regimens. Recent studies 
have described the DRMs that emerge in patients receiving tenofovir prodrugs, the
nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz and rilpivirine,
ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, and the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and
elvitegravir. Several small studies have described DRMs that emerge in patients
receiving dolutegravir.
