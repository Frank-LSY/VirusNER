Human immunodeficiency virus has been affecting the human population for more
than 30 years. During this time period, more effective, safe, simple, and
tolerable pharmacologic agents have been developed. To date, there are 26
antiretroviral agents available that are used either as a single agent or a
coformulation in an antiretroviral regimen. The goal of these medications is to
achieve viral suppression in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency
virus. Evidence continues to support the most effective combinations. It is
important that clinicians are knowledgeable of updates so as to provide the best 
possible medical regimen for this population.
