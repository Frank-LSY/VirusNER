Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a significant source of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. No effective vaccine is available to prevent HIV
transmission, and although antiretroviral therapy can prevent disease
progression, it does not cure HIV infection. Substantial effort is therefore
currently directed toward basic research on HIV pathogenesis and persistence and 
developing methods to stop the spread of the HIV epidemic and cure those
individuals already infected with HIV. Humanized mice are versatile tools for the
study of HIV and its interaction with the human immune system. These models
generally consist of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human cells or
reconstituted with a near-complete human immune system. Here, we describe the
major humanized mouse models currently in use, and some recent advances that have
been made in HIV research/therapeutics using these models.
