BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive subjects present impairment in 
muscle function, neural activation, balance, and gait. In other populations, all 
of these factors have been associated with muscle strength asymmetry.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the existence of muscle strength asymmetry between
dominant and non-dominant lower limbs and to determine the
hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio in Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive 
subjects.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 48 subjects were included (22 men and 26 
women; mean age 44.6 years), all of them under highly active antiretroviral
therapy. They performed isokinetic strength efforts at speeds of 60°/s and 180°/s
for knee extension and flexion in concentric-concentric mode.
RESULTS: Peak torque was higher (p<0.01) at 60°/s for quadriceps (193, SD=57 vs. 
173, SD=55% body mass) and hamstrings (97, SD=36 vs. 90, SD=37% body mass) in
dominant compared to non-dominant. Similarly, peak torque was higher at 180°/s
(quadriceps 128, SD=44 vs. 112, SD=42; hamstrings 64, SD=24 vs. 57, SD=26% body
mass) in dominant. Average power was also higher for all muscle groups and
speeds, comparing dominant with non-dominant. The hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio 
at 60°/s was 0.50 for dominant and 0.52 for non-dominant, and at 180°/s, it was
0.51 for both limbs, with no significant difference between them. The percentage 
of subjects with strength asymmetry ranged from 46 to 58%, depending upon muscle 
group and speed analyzed.
CONCLUSION: Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive subjects present muscle
strength asymmetry between lower limbs, assessed through isokinetic dynamometry.
