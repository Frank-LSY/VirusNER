The emergence and spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance
from antiretroviral roll-out programs remain a threat to long-term control of the
HIV-AIDS epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The patterns of
drug resistance and factors driving emergence of resistance are complex and
multifactorial. The key drivers of drug resistance in LMICs are reviewed here,
and recommendations are made to limit their influence on antiretroviral therapy
efficacy.
