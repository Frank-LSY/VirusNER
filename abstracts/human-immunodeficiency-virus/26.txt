The latent HIV-1 reservoir in blood decays very slowly, even during prolonged
suppression of viral replication by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mechanisms for 
reservoir persistence include replenishment through low-level viral replication, 
longevity and homeostatic proliferation of memory T cells, and most recently
appreciated, clonal expansion of HIV-infected cells. Clonally expanded cells make
up a large and increasing fraction of the residual infected cell population on
ART, and insertion of HIV proviruses into certain host cellular genes has been
associated with this proliferation. That the vast majority of proviruses are
defective clouds our assessment of the degree to which clonally expanded cells
harbor infectious viruses, and thus the extent to which they contribute to
reservoirs relevant to curing infection. This review summarizes past studies that
have defined our current understanding and the gaps in our knowledge of the
mechanisms by which proviral integration and clonal expansion sustain the HIV
reservoir.
