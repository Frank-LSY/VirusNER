Although potent combination antiretroviral therapy can effectively block viral
replication in the host, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists due to the
existence of latent but replication-competent proviruses residing primarily in a 
very small population of resting memory CD4+ T cells. Viral latency is
established when the expression of the autoregulatory viral trans-activating
factor Tat is reduced to subthreshold levels. The absence of Tat reduces HIV
transcription and protein production to levels that make the host cell invisible 
to the immune system and refractory to antiretroviral treatment. Key host cell
mechanisms that drive HIV into latency are sequestration of transcription
initiation factors, establishment of epigenetic barriers inactivating the
proviral promoter, and blockage of the assembly of the host elongation factor
P-TEFb. This comprehensive understanding of the molecular control of HIV
transcription is leading to the development of optimized combinatorial
reactivation and immune surveillance strategies designed to purge the latent
viral reservoir.
