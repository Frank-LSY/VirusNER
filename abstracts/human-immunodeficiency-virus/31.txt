BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus 2 infection is endemic in West Africa
but is also found in parts of Europe, North and South America, and India where it
is thought to have been introduced secondary to migration and commercial trade
ties. It is less common than Human immunodeficiency virus 1, with differences in 
pathogenicity, lower rates of transmission, longer asymptomatic period and slower
progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Human immunodeficiency virus 2
is also associated with diagnostic challenges given the lack of commercially
available diagnostic tests, and management challenges given intrinsic resistance 
to many anti-retroviral therapies.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 65Â year old South Indian female,
visiting her family in Australia, who presented with weight loss, pancytopaenia
and generalised lymphadenopathy on a background of newly diagnosed congestive
cardiac failure. Multiple investigations were performed to elucidate the cause of
her presentation, with the eventual unexpected diagnosis of human
immunodeficiency virus 2. She was commenced on anti-retroviral treatment and made
a remarkable recovery.
CONCLUSION: We describe the challenges associated with diagnosis of human
immunodeficiency virus 2 due to lack of commercially available diagnostics, as
well as the treatment and management challenges including the fact that human
immunodeficiency virus 2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Human immunodeficiency virus 2 infection should be
considered in patients who present with symptoms and signs that do not point
towards a clear diagnosis, such as unexplained pancytopaenia or lymphadenopathy, 
and who have risk factors such as being from an endemic area or having had blood 
transfusions, especially prior to the commencement of blood-borne virus screening
of blood donors.
