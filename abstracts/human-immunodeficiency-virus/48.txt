The recent development of fluorescence microscopy approaches overcoming the
diffraction limit of light microscopy opened possibilities for studying
small-scale cellular processes. The spatial resolution achieved by these novel
techniques, together with the possibility to perform live-cell and multicolor
imaging, make them ideally suited for visualization of native viruses and
subviral structures within the complex environment of a host cell or organ, thus 
providing fundamentally new possibilities for investigating virus-cell
interactions. Here, we review the use of super-resolution microscopy approaches
to study virus-cell interactions, and discuss recent insights into human
immunodeficiency virus biology obtained by exploiting these novel techniques.
