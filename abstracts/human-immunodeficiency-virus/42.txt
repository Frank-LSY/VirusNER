Improved survival with combination antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic
increase in the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals
50Â years of age or older such that by 2020 more than 50% of HIV-infected persons 
in the United States will be above this age. Recent studies confirm that
antiretroviral therapy should be offered to all HIV-infected patients regardless 
of age, symptoms, CD4+ cell count, or HIV viral load. However, when compared with
HIV-uninfected populations, even with suppression of measurable HIV replication, 
older individuals are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, malignancies,
liver disease, and other comorbidities.
