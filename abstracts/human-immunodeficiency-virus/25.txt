Current HIV therapy is not curative regardless of how soon after infection it is 
initiated or how long it is administered, and therapy interruption almost
invariably results in robust viral rebound. Human immunodeficiency virus
persistence is therefore the major obstacle to a cure for AIDS. The testing and
implementation of novel yet unproven approaches to HIV eradication that could
compromise the health status of HIV-infected individuals might not be ethically
warranted. Therefore, adequate in vitro and in vivo evidence of efficacy is
needed to facilitate the clinical implementation of promising strategies for an
HIV cure. Animal models of HIV infection have a strong and well-documented
history of bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and eventual clinical 
implementation. More recently, animal models have been developed and implemented 
for the in vivo evaluation of novel HIV cure strategies. In this article, we
review the recent progress in this rapidly moving area of research, focusing on
the two most promising model systems: humanized mice and nonhuman primates.
