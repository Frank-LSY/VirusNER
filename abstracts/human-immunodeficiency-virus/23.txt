The uneven anatomic distribution of cell subsets that harbor human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during antiretroviral therapy (ART) complicates
investigation of the barriers to HIV cure. Here we propose that while previous
studies done largely in blood cells have led to important investigations into HIV
latency, other important mechanisms of HIV persistence during ART may not be
readily apparent in the bloodstream. We specifically consider as an example the
question of ongoing HIV replication during ART. We discuss how growing
understanding of key anatomic sanctuaries for the virus can inform future
experiments aimed at further clarifying this issue.
