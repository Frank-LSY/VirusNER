One of the major barriers to the successful design and implementation of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) curative strategies is the limited ability to
sensitively, specifically, and precisely quantify and characterize the whole-body
burden of replication-competent HIV in individuals on effective antiretroviral
therapy. Here, we review the development and validation of assays that directly
and indirectly measure the size and distribution of the reservoir in blood and
tissues. We also discuss the role that treatment interruptions will have in
validating these assays and ultimately as a "proof of cure."
