The strong dependence of retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 
1 (HIV-1), on host cell factors is no more apparent than when the endosomal
sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is purposely disengaged.
The resulting potent inhibition of retrovirus release underscores the importance 
of understanding fundamental structure-function relationships at the ESCRT-HIV-1 
interface. Recent studies utilizing advanced imaging technologies have helped
clarify these relationships, overcoming hurdles to provide a range of potential
models for ESCRT-mediated virus abscission. Here, we discuss these models in the 
context of prior work detailing ESCRT machinery and the HIV-1 release process. To
provide a template for further refinement, we propose a new working model for
ESCRT-mediated HIV-1 release that reconciles disparate and seemingly conflicting 
studies.
