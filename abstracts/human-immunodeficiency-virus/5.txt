Healthcare delivery has advanced due to the implementation of point-of-care
testing, which is often performed within minutes to hours in minimally equipped
laboratories or at home. Technologic advances are leading to point-of-care kits
that incorporate nucleic acid-based assays, including polymerase chain reaction, 
isothermal amplification, ligation, and hybridization reactions. As a limited
number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with clinically
significant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance, assays to detect 
these mutations have been developed. Early versions of these assays have been
used in research. This review summarizes the principles underlying each assay and
discusses strategic needs for their incorporation into the management of HIV
infection.
