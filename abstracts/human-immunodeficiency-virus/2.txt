The human immunodeficiency virus epidemic is a major health challenge of the
twenty-first century as the transition from infectious complications to
noncommunicable disease becomes more evident. These patients may present to the
emergency department with a variety of cardiovascular diseases, such as acute
coronary syndromes, heart failure, pericardial disease, infective endocarditis,
venothromboembolism, and other conditions. Increased awareness is needed among
health care professionals to enhance adequate identification and promote prompt
management of these patients.
