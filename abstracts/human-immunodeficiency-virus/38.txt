The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a global pandemic and
there is an urgent need for innovative treatment. Immune cells represent a major 
target of virus infection, but are also therapeutic targets. Currently, no
antiretroviral therapy targets macrophages, which function as portal of entry and
as major long-term deposit of HIV. It has been shown before that human
macrophages efficiently internalize gold nanoparticles, a fact which might be
used to target them with drug-nanoparticle conjugates. Here, the authors use gold
nanocarriers to facilitate delivery of stavudine, a widely used antiretroviral
drug, to primary human macrophages. Using an ease-of-use coupling method, a
striking potentiation of stavudine intake by macrophages using gold nanocarriers 
is shown. Further, the carriers induce a specific subtype of proinflammatory
activation indicative for antiviral activity of macrophages, which suggests
promising novel treatment options for HIV.
