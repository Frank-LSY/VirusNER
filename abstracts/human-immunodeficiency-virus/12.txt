BACKGROUND/AIMS: The number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
patients on hemodialysis (HD) have increased, and their prognostic factors are
still poorly clarified. The study aimed to identify factors that can influence
the survival of HIV-infected patients on HD.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 44 HIV-infected patients on
HD.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (39%) died. Median survival on HD was 30.8 months
and the survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 82.5 and 62.9%, respectively. Male
(relative risk [RR] 3.1, p = 0.040) and blacks (RR 2.5, p = 0.037) had higher
risk of death. The patients who died had a shorter duration of HIV infection (p =
0.028), had a higher viral load (p = 0.044), more opportunistic infections (p =
0.013), and a lower serum albumin (p = 0.009). Lower serum albumin, nonsexual HIV
transmission, viral load, opportunistic infections, and usage of catheters were
associated with lower survival.
CONCLUSION: Several demographic, viral, and dialysis variables may help to
predict survival of this population. The intervention in these factors could
improve their prognosis.
