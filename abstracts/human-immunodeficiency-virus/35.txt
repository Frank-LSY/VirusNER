Over the last 2 decades human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a
chronic disease requiring long-term management. Aging, antiretroviral therapy,
chronic inflammation, and several other factors contribute to the increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease in patients infected with HIV. In low-income and
middle-income countries where antiretroviral therapy access is limited, cardiac
disease is most commonly related to opportunistic infections and end-stage
manifestations of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, including
HIV-associated cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cardiovascular screening, prevention, and risk factor management are important
factors in the management of patients infected with HIV worldwide.
