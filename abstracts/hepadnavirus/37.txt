We aimed toidentify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCPtransporter function.METHODS: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for theiranti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressingNTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed.RESULTS: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC50. Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. Thissuggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function.Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependentuptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinicallyrelevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that theanti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. Thesebroadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing newdrugs with fewer adverse effects.LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we identified new compounds that selectivelyinhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry, and did not impair bile acid uptake. Ourevidence offers a new strategy for developing anti-HBV drugs with fewer sideeffects.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published byElsevier B.V.
