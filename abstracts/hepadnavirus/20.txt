New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry,replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are indevelopment. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis Bnecessitates a standardised appraisal of the efficacy and safety of thesetreatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinicaltrials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery toregulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinicaltrials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a completesterilising cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to befeasible. Instead, a functional cure characterised by sustained loss of hepatitisB surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion,which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion ofpatients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. Development of standardised assays for novel biomarkers toward better defininghepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novelantiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatmentscan be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacyor to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limitedproof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activityshould be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety ofany new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety ofcurrently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues.Copyright Â© 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, EuropeanAssociation for the Study of the Liver.
