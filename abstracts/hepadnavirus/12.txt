Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Sciences, Charles University,Prague, Czech Republic.In mammals, protein arginine methyltransferase 5, PRMT5, is the main type IIenzyme responsible for the majority of symmetric dimethylarginine formation inpolypeptides. Recent study reported that PRMT5 restricts Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication through epigenetic repression of HBV DNA transcription andinterference with encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Here we demonstrate that PRMT5interacts with the HBV core (HBc) protein and dimethylates arginine residueswithin the arginine-rich domain (ARD) of the carboxyl-terminus. ARD consists offour arginine rich subdomains, ARDI, ARDII, ARDIII and ARDIV. Mutation analysisof ARDs revealed that arginine methylation of HBc required the wild-type statusof both ARDI and ARDII. Mass spectrometry analysis of HBc identified multiplepotential ubiquitination, methylation and phosphorylation sites, out of whichlysine K7 and arginines R150 (within ARDI) and R156 (outside ARDs) were shown to be modified by ubiquitination and methylation, respectively. The HBc symmetricdimethylation appeared to be linked to serine phosphorylation and nuclear import of HBc protein. Conversely, the monomethylated HBc retained in the cytoplasm.Thus, overexpression of PRMT5 led to increased nuclear accumulation of HBc, andvice versa, down-regulation of PRMT5 resulted in reduced levels of HBc in nuclei of transfected cells. In summary, we identified PRMT5 as a potent controller ofHBc cell trafficking and function and described two novel types of HBcpost-translational modifications (PTMs), arginine methylation and ubiquitination.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0186982 PMCID: PMC5655436PMID: 29065155  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
