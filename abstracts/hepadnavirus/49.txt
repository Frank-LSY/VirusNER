Many viral factors, such as viral load,genotype, and specific viral mutations, are known to affect disease progression. HBV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading function, therefore, many HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, mutants, and recombinants emerge. Differencesbetween genotypes in response to antiviral treatment have been determined. Todate, 10 HBV genotypes, scattered across different geographical regions, havebeen identified. For example, genotype A has a tendency for chronicity, whereasviral mutations are frequently encountered in genotype C. Both chronicity andmutation frequency are common in genotype D. LC and progression to HCC are morecommonly encountered with genotypes C and D than the other genotypes. Pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes explain disease intensity, progression to LC,and HCC. In conclusion, genotype determination in CHB infection is important inestimating disease progression and planning optimal antiviral treatment.DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v20.i18.5427 PMCID: PMC4017058PMID: 24833873  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
