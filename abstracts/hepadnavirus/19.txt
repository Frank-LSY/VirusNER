Electronicaddress: jamesou@hsc.usc.edu.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects 250 million people worldwide,resulting in nearly one million deaths annually. Studies in recent years havesignificantly improved our knowledge on the mechanisms of HBV persistence. HBVuses multiple pathways to harness host innate immunity to enhance itsreplication. It can also take advantage of the developing immune system and thenot-yet-stabilized gut microbiota of young children to facilitate itspersistence, and use maternal viral e antigen to educate immunity of theoffspring to support its persistence after vertical transmission. The knowledgegained from these recent studies paves the way for the development of newtherapies for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, which has so far been very challenging.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
