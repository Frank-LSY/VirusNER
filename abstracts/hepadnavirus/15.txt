The potential antiviral activity of Flavocoxid against hepatitis Bvirus (HBV) was evaluated. Additionally, it was investigated if Flavocoxid usedin combination with Entecavir could potentiate its anti-HBV activity.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatoma cells replicating HBV were treated withFlavocoxid, or Entecavir alone or in combination for up to 5 days. Viralreplicative intermediates, transcripts, and cccDNA levels were evaluated inHBV-replicating cells by real-time PCR, Southern and Northern blotting.Expression profiling was performed using TaqMan low-density arrays.RESULTS: Flavocoxid treatment induced a reduction of HBV replicativeintermediates, the amount of transcripts, and HBsAg levels. Flavocoxid andEntecavir combination therapy further decreased the amount of HBV replicativeintermediates, compared to Flavocoxid alone. Importantly, Flavocoxid alone or in combination with Entecavir also induced a reduction of cccDNA. Gene-expressionanalysis showed that Flavocoxid activates type I IFNs-signaling and dampens theHBV-induced inflammatory response.CONCLUSIONS: Flavocoxid inhibits HBV replication by targeting multiple steps ofviral life cycle. These results indicate that the antiviral activity of Entecaviris potentiated by Flavocoxid, suggesting that this medical food might beconsidered as an adjuvant for anti-HBV therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00011-017-1099-2 PMID: 29018874  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
