Perinatal transmission is one of the most common routes of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) transmission. This study aims to identify the epidemiological features of
HBV among pregnant Iranian women. This study followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Two authors
independently searched several online databases without time limit until May
2017. The databases include Magiran, Iranmedex, SID, Medlib, IranDoc, Scopus,
PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The data
were analyzed based on a random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
software version 2. Thirty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The 
prevalence of HBV among pregnant Iranian women was 1.18% (95% CI: 0.09%-1.53%).
The prevalence of HBV among pregnant women living in urban and rural areas was
1.60% (95% CI: 0.06%-4.30%) and 1.70% (95% CI: 0.09%-3.2%), respectively. The
prevalence of HBV among housewives and working pregnant women was 4.3% (95% CI:
1.4%-12.5%) and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.02%-5.8%), respectively. The risk of developing
an HBV infection was significantly associated with illiteracy (p = 0.013),
abortion (p = 0.001), blood transfusion (p < 0.001) and addicted spouse
(p = 0.045). However, no significant relationship was observed between HBV
infection and urbanization (p = 0.65), occupation (p = 0.37), history of surgery 
(p = 0.32) or tattooing (p = 0.69). Vaccination coverage (receiving at least a
single dose) in pregnant women was 9.8% (95% CI: 5.3%-17.5%). The prevalence of
HBV among pregnant women is lower than in the general population of Iran. HBV
vaccination coverage was low among pregnant Iranian women. Therefore, health
policy-makers are recommended to enforce immunization programs for HBV
vaccination among high-risk pregnant women.
