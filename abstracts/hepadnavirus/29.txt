Importantly, hepatocyte intrusion by HBV particles results ina complex deregulation of both viral and host cellular genetic and epigeneticprocesses. Among the attempts to develop novel therapeutic approaches against HBVinfection, several options targeting the epigenomic regulation of HBV replicationare gaining attention. These include the experimental treatment with 'epidrugs'. Moreover, as a targeted approach, the principle of 'epigenetic editing' recently is being exploited to control viral replication. Silencing of HBV by specificrewriting of epigenetic marks might diminish viral replication, viremia, andinfectivity, eventually controlling the disease and its complications.Additionally, epigenetic editing can be used as an experimental tool to increase our limited understanding regarding the role of epigenetic modifications in viralinfections. Aiming for permanent epigenetic reprogramming of the viral genomewithout unspecific side effects, this breakthrough may pave the roads for anambitious technological pursuit: to start designing a curative approach utilizingmanipulative molecular therapies for viral infections in vivo.Â© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.DOI: 10.1111/febs.14094 PMID: 28457020  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
