Electronic address: haitguo@iupui.edu.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA is essential to the virus life cycle, its elimination during chronic infection is considered criticalto a durable therapy but has not been achieved by current antivirals. Despitebeing essential, cccDNA has not been the major target of high throughputscreening (HTS), largely because of the limitations of current HBV tissue culturesystems, including the impracticality of detecting cccDNA itself. In response to this need, we have previously developed a proof-of-concept HepDE19 cell line inwhich the production of wildtype e antigen (HBeAg) is dependent upon cccDNA.However, the existing assay system is not ideal for HTS because the HBeAg ELISAcross reacts with a viral HBeAg homologue, which is the core antigen (HBcAg)expressed largely in a cccDNA-independent fashion in HepDE19 cells. To furtherimprove the assay specificity, we report herein a "second-generation" cccDNAreporter cell line, termed HepBHAe82. In the similar principle of HepDE19 line,an in-frame HA epitope tag was introduced into the precore domain of HBeAg openreading frame in the transgene of HepBHAe82 cells without disrupting anycis-element critical for HBV replication and HBeAg secretion. A chemiluminescenceELISA assay (CLIA) for the detection of HA-tagged HBeAg with HA antibody serving as capture antibody and HBeAb serving as detection antibody has been developed toeliminate the confounding signal from HBcAg. The miniaturized HepBHAe82 cellbased assay system exhibits high level of cccDNA-dependent HA-HBeAg productionand high specific readout signals with low background. We have also established aHepHA-HBe4 cell line expressing transgene-dependent HA-HBeAg as a counter screen to identify HBeAg inhibitors. The HepBHAe82 system is amenable to antiviral HTSdevelopment, and can be used to identify host factors that regulate cccDNAmetabolism and transcription.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
