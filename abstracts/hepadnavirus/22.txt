Metabolic remodeling occurs in immune cells during an infection. Host cells must 
upregulate energy production for growth, proliferation, and effector functions to
limit the damage imposed by pathogens. One example, the hepatitis B virus,
induces hepatic injury in human hepatocytes through dysregulation of aerobic
glycolysis and lipid metabolism. Increased glycolytic metabolism mediated by
elevated expression of Glut1, glucose influx, and lactate secretion is associated
with this Warburg phenotype, a classic metabolic signature also observed in
cancer cells. This article brings into focus the tight interaction between HBV
infection and metabolic dysfunction and how these processes facilitate the
progression of end-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. We
also provide evidence and models by which other viruses such as HIV and Zika
disrupt their host metabolic machinery. The emergence of the immunometabolism
field provides novel opportunities to take advantage of intermediary metabolites 
and key metabolic pathways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
