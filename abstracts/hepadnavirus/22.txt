Host cells must upregulate energy production for growth, proliferation, and effector functions tolimit the damage imposed by pathogens. One example, the hepatitis B virus,induces hepatic injury in human hepatocytes through dysregulation of aerobicglycolysis and lipid metabolism. Increased glycolytic metabolism mediated byelevated expression of Glut1, glucose influx, and lactate secretion is associatedwith this Warburg phenotype, a classic metabolic signature also observed incancer cells. This article brings into focus the tight interaction between HBVinfection and metabolic dysfunction and how these processes facilitate theprogression of end-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Wealso provide evidence and models by which other viruses such as HIV and Zikadisrupt their host metabolic machinery. The emergence of the immunometabolismfield provides novel opportunities to take advantage of intermediary metabolites and key metabolic pathways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.DOI: 10.1177/2040206617701372 PMCID: PMC5890528PMID: 28768434  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
