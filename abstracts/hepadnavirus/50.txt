Epub 2014 May 4.The role of Kupffer cells in hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections.Boltjes A(1), Movita D(1), Boonstra A(1), Woltman AM(2).Author information: (1)Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC University MedicalCenter, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.(2)Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC University MedicalCenter, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Electronic address: a.woltman@erasmusmc.nl.Globally, over 500 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis Bvirus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These chronic infections cause liverinflammation, and may result in fibrosis/cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.Albeit that HBV and HCV differ in various aspects, clearance, persistence, andimmunopathology of either infection depends on the interplay between the innateand adaptive responses in the liver. Kupffer cells, the liver-residentmacrophages, are abundantly present in the sinusoids of the liver. These cellshave been shown to be crucial players to maintain homeostasis, but alsocontribute to pathology. However, it is important to note that especially during pathology, Kupffer cells are difficult to distinguish from infiltratingmonocytes/macrophages and other myeloid cells. In this review we discuss ourcurrent understanding of Kupffer cells, and assess their role in the regulationof anti-viral immunity and disease pathogenesis during HBV and HCV infection.Copyright Â© 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.
