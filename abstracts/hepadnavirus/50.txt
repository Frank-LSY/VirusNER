Globally, over 500 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B
virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These chronic infections cause liver
inflammation, and may result in fibrosis/cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.
Albeit that HBV and HCV differ in various aspects, clearance, persistence, and
immunopathology of either infection depends on the interplay between the innate
and adaptive responses in the liver. Kupffer cells, the liver-resident
macrophages, are abundantly present in the sinusoids of the liver. These cells
have been shown to be crucial players to maintain homeostasis, but also
contribute to pathology. However, it is important to note that especially during 
pathology, Kupffer cells are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating
monocytes/macrophages and other myeloid cells. In this review we discuss our
current understanding of Kupffer cells, and assess their role in the regulation
of anti-viral immunity and disease pathogenesis during HBV and HCV infection.
