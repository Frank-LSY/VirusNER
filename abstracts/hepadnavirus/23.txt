The molecular mechanisms determining HBV persistence are not fully understood,but these appear to be multifactorial and the unique replication strategyemployed by HBV enables its maintenance in infected hepatocytes. Both thestability of the HBV genome, which forms a stable minichromosome, the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the hepatocyte nucleus, and the inability of the immune system to resolve chronic HBV infection are believed to be key mechanisms of HBV chronicity. Since a true cure of HBV requires clearance of intranuclearcccDNA from infected hepatocytes, understanding the mechanisms involved in cccDNAbiogenesis, regulation and stability is mandatory to achieve HBV eradication.This review will summarize the state of knowledge on these mechanisms includingthe impact of current treatments on the cccDNA stability and activity. We willfocus on events challenging cccDNA persistence in dividing hepatocytes.DOI: 10.3390/v9060156 PMCID: PMC5490831PMID: 28635668  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
