Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are thought to be among theimportant host targets of HBx. However, the structure and function of HBx arepoorly understood and the molecular mechanism of HBx-induced carcinogenesisremains unknown. In this study, we report biochemical and structuralcharacterization of HBx. The recombinant HBx protein contains metal ions, inparticular iron and zinc. A BH3-like motif in HBx (residues 110-135) binds Bcl-2 with a dissociation constant of ∼193 μM, which is drastically lower than that fora canonical BH3 motif from Bim or Bad. Structural analysis reveals that, similar to other BH3 motifs, the BH3-like motif of HBx adopts an amphipathic α-helix and binds the conserved BH3-binding groove on Bcl-2. Unlike the helical Bim or BadBH3 motif, the C-terminal portion of the bound HBx BH3-like motif has an extendedconformation and makes considerably fewer interactions with Bcl-2. Theseobservations suggest that HBx may modulate Bcl-2 function in a way that isdifferent from that of the classical BH3-only proteins.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1525616113 PMCID: PMC4776483PMID: 26858413  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
