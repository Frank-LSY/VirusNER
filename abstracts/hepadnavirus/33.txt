Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a para-retrovirus or retroid virus that contains a
double-stranded DNA genome and replicates this DNA via reverse transcription of a
RNA pregenome. Viral reverse transcription takes place within a capsid upon
packaging of the RNA and the viral reverse transcriptase. A major characteristic 
of HBV replication is the selection of capsids containing the double-stranded
DNA, but not those containing the RNA or the single-stranded DNA replication
intermediate, for envelopment during virion secretion. The complete HBV virion
particles thus contain an outer envelope, studded with viral envelope proteins,
that encloses the capsid, which, in turn, encapsidates the double-stranded DNA
genome. Furthermore, HBV morphogenesis is characterized by the release of
subviral particles that are several orders of magnitude more abundant than the
complete virions. One class of subviral particles are the classical surface
antigen particles (Australian antigen) that contain only the viral envelope
proteins, whereas the more recently discovered genome-free (empty) virions
contain both the envelope and capsid but no genome. In addition, recent evidence 
suggests that low levels of RNA-containing particles may be released, after all. 
We will summarize what is currently known about how the complete and incomplete
HBV particles are assembled. We will discuss briefly the functions of the
subviral particles, which remain largely unknown. Finally, we will explore the
utility of the subviral particles, particularly, the potential of empty virions
and putative RNA virions as diagnostic markers and the potential of empty virons 
as a vaccine candidate.
