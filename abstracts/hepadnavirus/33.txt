Viral reverse transcription takes place within a capsid uponpackaging of the RNA and the viral reverse transcriptase. A major characteristic of HBV replication is the selection of capsids containing the double-strandedDNA, but not those containing the RNA or the single-stranded DNA replicationintermediate, for envelopment during virion secretion. The complete HBV virionparticles thus contain an outer envelope, studded with viral envelope proteins,that encloses the capsid, which, in turn, encapsidates the double-stranded DNAgenome. Furthermore, HBV morphogenesis is characterized by the release ofsubviral particles that are several orders of magnitude more abundant than thecomplete virions. One class of subviral particles are the classical surfaceantigen particles (Australian antigen) that contain only the viral envelopeproteins, whereas the more recently discovered genome-free (empty) virionscontain both the envelope and capsid but no genome. In addition, recent evidence suggests that low levels of RNA-containing particles may be released, after all. We will summarize what is currently known about how the complete and incompleteHBV particles are assembled. We will discuss briefly the functions of thesubviral particles, which remain largely unknown. Finally, we will explore theutility of the subviral particles, particularly, the potential of empty virionsand putative RNA virions as diagnostic markers and the potential of empty virons as a vaccine candidate.DOI: 10.3390/v9030056 PMCID: PMC5371811PMID: 28335554  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
