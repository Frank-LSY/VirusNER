Electronic address: harrisau@mail.nih.gov.While nanoparticle vaccine technology is gaining interest due to the success ofvaccines like those for the human papillomavirus that is based on viral capsidnanoparticles, little information is available on the disassembly and reassembly of viral surface glycoprotein-based nanoparticles. One such particle is thehepatitis B virus surface antigen (sAg) that exists as nanoparticles. Here weshow, using biochemical analysis coupled with electron microscopy, that sAgnanoparticle disassembly requires both reducing agent to disrupt intermoleculardisulfide bonds, and detergent to disrupt hydrophobic interactions that stabilizethe nanoparticle. Particles were otherwise resistant to salt and urea, suggestingthe driving mechanism of particle formation involves hydrophobic interactions. Wereassembled isolated sAg protein into nanoparticles by detergent removal andreassembly resulted in a wider distribution of particle diameters. Knowledge ofthese driving forces of nanoparticle assembly and stability should facilitateconstruction of epitope-displaying nanoparticles that can be used as immunogensin vaccines.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.virol.2016.12.025 PMCID: PMC5276716PMID: 28061386  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
