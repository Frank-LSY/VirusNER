Extant hepadnaviruses include avihepadnaviruses of birds andorthohepadnaviruses of mammals. The core promoter (Cp) of hepadnaviruses is vitalfor viral gene expression and replication. We previously identified in thebudgerigar genome two EVEs that contain the full-length genome of an ancientbudgerigar hepadnavirus (eBHBV1 and eBHBV2). Here, we found eBHBV1 Cp and eBHBV2 Cp were active in several human and chicken cell lines. A region from nt -85to -11 in eBHBV1 Cp was critical for the promoter activity. Bioinformaticanalysis revealed a putative binding site of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), aubiquitous transcription factor, at nt -64 to -50 in eBHBV1 Cp. The NF-Y corebinding site (ATTGG, nt -58 to -54) was essential for eBHBV1 Cp activity. Thesame results were obtained with eBHBV2 Cp and duck hepatitis B virus Cp. Thesubunit A of NF-Y (NF-YA) was recruited via the NF-Y core binding site to eBHBV1 Cp and upregulated the promoter activity. Finally, the NF-Y core binding site is conserved in the Cps of all the extant avihepadnaviruses but not oforthohepadnaviruses. Interestingly, a putative and functionally important NF-Ycore binding site is located at nt -21 to -17 in the Cp of human hepatitis Bvirus. In conclusion, our findings have pinpointed an evolutionary conserved and functionally critical NF-Y binding element in the Cps of avihepadnaviruses.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.
