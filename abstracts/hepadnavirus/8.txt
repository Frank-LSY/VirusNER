The heterogeneous clinical courses of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infectionreflect the complex host-virus interactions, and point to the difficulty andnecessity of identifying the patients at risk. With the advance of HBV virology, several viral factors have been found to be associated with the long-termclinical outcomes of CHB patients. Different viral factors probe differentaspects of CHB. Integration of these viral factors may help to determine thedisease state of patients more accurately, and identify the patients who require timely antiviral therapy to prevent the development of detrimental clinicaloutcomes. In this article, we will introduce the conventional and emerging viral factors that are associated with clinical outcomes and discuss their utility in aclinical setting.Â© The Author 2017.
