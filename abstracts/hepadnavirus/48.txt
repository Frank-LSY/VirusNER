Based on an intergroup divergence of greaterthan 7.5% across the complete genome, HBV has been classified phylogeneticallyinto 9 genotypes, A-I, with a putative 10th genotype 'J', isolated from a single individual. With between approximately 4 and 8% intergroup nucleotide divergence across the complete genome and good bootstrap support, genotypes A-D, F, H, and Iare classified further into subgenotypes. There is a broad and highlystatistically significant correlation between serological subtypes and genotypes,and in some cases, serological subtypes can be used to differentiatesubgenotypes. The genotypes, and certain subgenotypes, have distinct geographicaldistributions and are important in both the clinical manifestation of infectionand response to antiviral therapy. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and geneticvariability of HBV are useful in epidemiological and transmission studies,tracing human migrations, and in predicting the risk for the development ofsevere liver disease and response to antiviral therapy. Moreover, knowledge ofthe genotype/subgenotype is important in implementing preventative strategies.Thus, it is crucial that new strains are correctly assigned to their respectivegenotype/subgenotype and consistent, unambiguous, and generally acceptednomenclature is utilized.Â© 2014 S.
