However, analysis of reassembled viral sequences revealed a relatively narrow distributionof variants in children, which was confirmed by a lower viral diversity inchildren than that in mothers. New closely related variants with combinations of two to five high-frequency mutations were observed in seven children withelevated ALT levels; the new variants out-competed the transmitted maternalvariants to become the dominant strains in five of them. Furthermore, 30mutations with a frequency >1% of all viruses within-host were present in thosechildren; the mutations caused 19 amino-acid substitutions. Interestingly, almostall were located within the well-known T-cell or B-cell epitopes.CONCLUSIONS: There are restrictive changes that occur in the early stages ofchronic HBV infection through MTCT with different clinical consequences. Thesedata might have important implications for future investigations of interrelated immunopathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2017 The British Infection Association.
