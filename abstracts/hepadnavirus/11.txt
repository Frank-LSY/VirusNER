Epub 2017Nov 2.Hepatitis B virus: virology, molecular biology, life cycle and intrahepaticspread.Karayiannis P(1).Author information: (1)Medical School, University of Nicosia, 21 Ilia Papakyriakou, 2414 Engomi, P.O.Box 24005, CY-1700, Nicosia, Cyprus. karayiannis.p@unic.ac.cy.Hepatitis B virus is a member of the Hepadnaviridae family and responsible forcausing acute and chronic hepatitis in humans. The current estimates of peoplechronically infected with the virus are put at 250 million worldwide.Immune-mediated liver damage in these individuals may lead to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. This review deals with our current understanding of the virology, molecular biology, life cycle andcell-to-cell spread of this very important pathogen, all of which are considered essential for current and future approaches to antiviral treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s12072-017-9829-7 PMID: 29098564  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
