Australian antigen, the envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), was
discovered in 1967 as a prevalent serum antigen in hepatitis B patients. Early
electron microscopy (EM) studies showed that this antigen was present in 22-nm
particles in patient sera, which were believed to be incomplete virus. Complete
virus, much less abundant than the 22-nm particles, was finally visualized in
1970. HBV was soon found to infect chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbon
apes, and, more recently, tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) and cynomolgus macaques 
(Macaca fascicularis). This restricted host range placed limits on the kinds of
studies that might be performed to better understand the biology and molecular
biology of HBV and to develop antiviral therapies to treat chronic infections.
About 10 years after the discovery of HBV, this problem was bypassed with the
discovery of viruses related to HBV in woodchucks, ground squirrels, and ducks.
Although unlikely animal models, their use revealed the key steps in hepadnavirus
replication and in the host response to infection, including the fact that the
viral nuclear episome is the ultimate target for immune clearance of transient
infections and antiviral therapy of chronic infections. Studies with these and
other animal models have also suggested interesting clues into the link between
chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.
