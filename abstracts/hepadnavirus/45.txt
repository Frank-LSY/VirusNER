Earlyelectron microscopy (EM) studies showed that this antigen was present in 22-nmparticles in patient sera, which were believed to be incomplete virus. Completevirus, much less abundant than the 22-nm particles, was finally visualized in1970. HBV was soon found to infect chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbonapes, and, more recently, tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). This restricted host range placed limits on the kinds ofstudies that might be performed to better understand the biology and molecularbiology of HBV and to develop antiviral therapies to treat chronic infections.About 10 years after the discovery of HBV, this problem was bypassed with thediscovery of viruses related to HBV in woodchucks, ground squirrels, and ducks.Although unlikely animal models, their use revealed the key steps in hepadnavirusreplication and in the host response to infection, including the fact that theviral nuclear episome is the ultimate target for immune clearance of transientinfections and antiviral therapy of chronic infections. Studies with these andother animal models have also suggested interesting clues into the link betweenchronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright Â© 2015 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.DOI: 10.1101/cshperspect.a021352 PMCID: PMC4382722PMID: 25833941  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
