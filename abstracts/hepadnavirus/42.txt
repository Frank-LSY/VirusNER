The detection of endogenous avian hepadnavirus DNA integrated into thegenomes of zebra finches has revealed a deep evolutionary origin ofhepadnaviruses that was not previously recognized, dating back at least 40million and possibly >80 million years ago. The nonprimate mammalian members ofthe Hepadnaviridae include the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), the groundsquirrel hepatitis virus, and arctic squirrel hepatitis virus, as well as anumber of members of the recently described bat hepatitis virus. Theidentification of hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) in higher primates, such aschimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbons that cluster with the human HBV, aswell as a number of recombinant forms between humans and primates, furtherimplies a more complex origin of this virus. We discuss the current theories ofthe origin and evolution of HBV and propose a model that includes cross-speciestransmissions and subsequent recombination events on a genetic backbone ofgenotype C HBV infection. The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective RNAvirus requiring the presence of the HBV for the completion of its life cycle. Theorigins of this virus remain unknown, although some recent studies have suggestedan ancient African radiation. The age of the association between HDV and HBV isalso unknown.Copyright Â© 2016 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.DOI: 10.1101/cshperspect.a021360 PMCID: PMC4691804PMID: 26729756  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
