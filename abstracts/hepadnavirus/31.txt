This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positivechronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negativechronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBVinfection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy isto improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, andconsequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBVreplication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, whileHBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA >2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated.Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patientsrequiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of apotent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir,tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment ofchoice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild tomoderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generallyrecommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression andHCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCCremains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Severalsubgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatmentstrategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.Copyright Â© 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published byElsevier B.V.
