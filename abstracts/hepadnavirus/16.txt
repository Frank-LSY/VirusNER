Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs), which are enveloped viruses with reverse-transcribed 
DNA genomes, constitute the family Hepadnaviridae. An outstanding feature of HBVs
is their streamlined genome organization with extensive gene overlap. Remarkably,
the ∼1,100 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding the envelope proteins is fully
nested within the ORF of the viral replicase P. Here, we report the discovery of 
a diversified family of fish viruses, designated nackednaviruses, which lack the 
envelope protein gene, but otherwise exhibit key characteristics of HBVs
including genome replication via protein-primed reverse-transcription and
utilization of structurally related capsids. Phylogenetic reconstruction
indicates that these two virus families separated more than 400 million years ago
before the rise of tetrapods. We show that HBVs are of ancient origin, descending
from non-enveloped progenitors in fishes. Their envelope protein gene emerged de 
novo, leading to a major transition in viral lifestyle, followed by co-evolution 
with their hosts over geologic eras.
