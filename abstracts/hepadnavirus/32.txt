Hepatitis B X protein (HBx) plays an essential role in the hepatitis B virus
(HBV) replication cycle, but the function of HBx has been elusive until recently.
It was recently shown that transcription from the HBV genome (covalently-closed
circular DNA, cccDNA) is inhibited by the structural maintenance of chromosome
5/6 complex (Smc5/6), and that a key function of HBx is to redirect the
DNA-damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) E3 ubiquitin ligase to target this complex
for degradation. By doing so, HBx alleviates transcriptional repression by Smc5/6
and stimulates HBV gene expression. In this review, we discuss in detail how the 
interplay between HBx and Smc5/6 was identified and characterized. We also
discuss what is known regarding the repression of cccDNA transcription by Smc5/6,
the timing of HBx expression, and the potential role of HBx in promoting
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
