Covalently closed circular DNA(cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected cells cannot be eliminated by presenttherapeutics and may result in persistence and relapse. Drug developmenttargeting cccDNA formation and maintenance is hindered by the lack of efficientcccDNA models and reliable cccDNA detection methods. Southern blotting isregarded as the gold standard for quantitative cccDNA detection, but it iscomplicated and not suitable for high-throughput drug screening, so moresensitive and simple methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-basedmethods, Invader assays, in situ hybridization and surrogates, have beendeveloped for cccDNA detection. However, most methods are not reliable enough,and there are no unified standards for these approaches. This review willsummarize available methods for cccDNA detection. It is hoped that more robustmethods for cccDNA monitoring will be developed and that standard operationprocedures for routine cccDNA detection in scientific research and clinicalmonitoring will be established.DOI: 10.3390/v9060139 PMCID: PMC5490816PMID: 28587292  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
