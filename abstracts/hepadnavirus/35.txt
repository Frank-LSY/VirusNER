HBx interacts withchromatin modifying enzymes and transcription factors to modulate histonepost-translational modifications and to regulate viral cccDNA transcription andcellular gene expression. Aiming to identify genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)directly targeted by HBx, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing(ChIP-Seq) to analyse HBV recruitment on host cell chromatin in cells replicatingHBV.RESULTS: ChIP-Seq high throughput sequencing of HBx-bound fragments was used toobtain a high-resolution, unbiased, mapping of HBx binding sites across thegenome in HBV replicating cells. Protein-coding genes and ncRNAs involved in cellmetabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer were enriched among HBx targetstogether with genes/ncRNAs known to modulate HBV replication. The directtranscriptional activation of genes/miRNAs that potentiate endocytosis(Ras-related in brain (RAB) GTPase family) and autophagy (autophagy related (ATG)genes, beclin-1, miR-33a) and the transcriptional repression of microRNAs(miR-138, miR-224, miR-576, miR-596) that directly target the HBV pgRNA and wouldinhibit HBV replication, contribute to HBx-mediated increase of HBV replication.CONCLUSIONS: Our ChIP-Seq analysis of HBx genome wide chromatin recruitmentdefined the repertoire of genes and ncRNAs directly targeted by HBx and led tothe identification of new mechanisms by which HBx positively regulates cccDNAtranscription and HBV replication.DOI: 10.1186/s12864-017-3561-5 PMCID: PMC5316204PMID: 28212627  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
