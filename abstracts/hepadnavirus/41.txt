The exact contributions of HBx are not fullyunderstood, in part because of the limitations of the assays used for its study. When HBV replication is driven from a plasmid DNA, the contribution of HBx ismodest. However, there is an absolute requirement for HBx in assays thatrecapitulate the infectious virus life cycle. There is much evidence that HBx cancontribute directly to HBV replication by acting on viral promoters embeddedwithin protein coding sequences. In addition, HBx may also contribute indirectly by modulating cellular pathways to benefit virus replication. Understanding themechanism(s) of HBx action during virus replication may provide insight intonovel ways to disrupt chronic HBV replication.Copyright Â© 2016 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.DOI: 10.1101/cshperspect.a021402 PMCID: PMC4772081PMID: 26747833  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
