The efficient replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) requires the HBV regulatory 
hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein. The exact contributions of HBx are not fully
understood, in part because of the limitations of the assays used for its study. 
When HBV replication is driven from a plasmid DNA, the contribution of HBx is
modest. However, there is an absolute requirement for HBx in assays that
recapitulate the infectious virus life cycle. There is much evidence that HBx can
contribute directly to HBV replication by acting on viral promoters embedded
within protein coding sequences. In addition, HBx may also contribute indirectly 
by modulating cellular pathways to benefit virus replication. Understanding the
mechanism(s) of HBx action during virus replication may provide insight into
novel ways to disrupt chronic HBV replication.
