Epub 2017 Nov 6.Epigenetic regulation of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA:Implications for epigenetic therapy against chronic hepatitis B.Hong X(1), Kim ES(2), Guo H(2).Author information: (1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Georgetown University MedicalCenter, Washington, DC.(2)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School ofMedicine, Indianapolis, IN.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a significant public health burdenworldwide. Although current therapeutics manage to control the diseaseprogression, lifelong treatment and surveillance are required because drugresistance develops during treatment and reactivations frequently occur followingmedication cessation. Thus, the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma isdecreased, but not eliminated. One major reason for failure of HBV treatment isthe inability to eradicate or inactivate the viral covalently closed circular DNA(cccDNA), which is a stable episomal form of the viral genome decorated with hosthistones and nonhistone proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications of cccDNA contribute to viral replication and the outcome ofchronic HBV infection. Here, we summarize current progress on HBV epigeneticsresearch and the therapeutic implications for chronic HBV infection by learningfrom the epigenetic therapies for cancer and other viral diseases, which may opena new venue to cure chronic hepatitis B.
