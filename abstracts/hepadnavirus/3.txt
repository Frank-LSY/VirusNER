Although many studies for the roles of HBV on pathogenesis ofthe liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepaticinflammation, cirrhosis, and HCC, have been reported, the mechanisms are notfully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have the protectivemechanisms to restore their damaged function by intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, but their chronic dysfunctions are associated with the pathogenesis of thevarious diseases. Furthermore, HBV can affect intra- or extracellular homeostasisthrough induction of ER and mitochondrial dysfunctions, leading to liver injury. Therefore, the mechanism by which HBV induces ER or mitochondrial stresses may bea therapeutic target for treatment of liver diseases.DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v23.i43.7657 PMCID: PMC5703926PMID: 29209107  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
