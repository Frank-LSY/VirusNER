Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic virus that causes acute and chronic
inflammatory liver diseases, often leading to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Although many studies for the roles of HBV on pathogenesis of
the liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic
inflammation, cirrhosis, and HCC, have been reported, the mechanisms are not
fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have the protective
mechanisms to restore their damaged function by intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, 
but their chronic dysfunctions are associated with the pathogenesis of the
various diseases. Furthermore, HBV can affect intra- or extracellular homeostasis
through induction of ER and mitochondrial dysfunctions, leading to liver injury. 
Therefore, the mechanism by which HBV induces ER or mitochondrial stresses may be
a therapeutic target for treatment of liver diseases.
