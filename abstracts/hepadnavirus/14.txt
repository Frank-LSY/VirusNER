Clinical observations have suggestedthat HBV genotype is associated with the response to IFN therapy; however, itsrole in viral responsiveness to IFN in HBV-infected hepatocytes remains unclear. Here, we produced infectious virions of HBV genotypes A to D to infect threewell-recognized cell-culture-based HBV infection systems, including primary humanhepatocytes (PHH), differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG), and HepG2-NTCP cells toquantitatively compare the antiviral effect of IFN-α on HBV across genotypes and cell models. The efficacy of IFN-α against HBV in hepatocytes was generallysimilar across genotypes A2, B5, C2, and D3; however, it was significantlydifferent among the infection models given that the half maximal inhibitoryconcentration value of IFN-α for inhibition of viral DNA replication in PHH (<20 U/mL) and dHepaRG cells were much lower than that in HepG2-NTCP cells (>500U/mL). Notably, even in PHH, IFN-α did not reduce HBV covalently closed circular DNA at the concentrations for which viral antigens and DNA replicationintermediates were strongly reduced. The three cell-culture models exhibiteddifferential cellular response to IFN-α. The genes reported to be associated withresponsiveness to IFN-α in patients were robustly induced in PHH while weaklyinduced in HepG2-NTCP cells upon IFN-α treatment. Reduction or promotion of IFNresponse in PHH or HepG2-NTCP cells significantly attenuated or improved theinhibitory capacity of IFN-α on HBV replication, respectively.CONCLUSION: In the cell-culture-based HBV infection models, the sensitivity of HBV to IFN-α inhepatocytes is determined more by the cell-intrinsic IFN response than by viralgenotype, and improvement of the IFN response in HepG2-NTCP cells promotes theefficacy of IFN-α against HBV.
