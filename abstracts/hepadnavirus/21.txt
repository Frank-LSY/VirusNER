The landscape for chronic HBV therapy is rapidly evolving. The latest generation 
of antiviral drugs provide robust virus suppression with a high barrier to
resistance that facilitates long-term treatment. However, low rates of HBsAg loss
demonstrate that additional strategies are needed to consistency achieve a
functional cure. The immune system can clear HBV and establish long-term control 
over the virus. Sufficiently boosting HBV immunity in chronic patients has been
very difficult due to immune exhaustion, immune dysregulation, and inhibitory
pathways suppressing the immune response. Therapeutic vaccines employing new
technology, vectors and new immunomodulatory drugs that can elicit direct
antiviral effects and cancel inhibitory mechanism may be able to overcome
exhaustion. This review will discuss the justification for immunotherapy, lessons
from previous trials and new vaccines/drugs in early stage clinical trials. The
challenges of correlating immune responses induced by these drugs to clinical
efficacy will also be addressed.
