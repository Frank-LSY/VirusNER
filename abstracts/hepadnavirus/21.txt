Electronic address:adam.gehring@uhnresearch.ca.The landscape for chronic HBV therapy is rapidly evolving. The latest generation of antiviral drugs provide robust virus suppression with a high barrier toresistance that facilitates long-term treatment. However, low rates of HBsAg lossdemonstrate that additional strategies are needed to consistency achieve afunctional cure. The immune system can clear HBV and establish long-term control over the virus. Sufficiently boosting HBV immunity in chronic patients has beenvery difficult due to immune exhaustion, immune dysregulation, and inhibitorypathways suppressing the immune response. Therapeutic vaccines employing newtechnology, vectors and new immunomodulatory drugs that can elicit directantiviral effects and cancel inhibitory mechanism may be able to overcomeexhaustion. This review will discuss the justification for immunotherapy, lessonsfrom previous trials and new vaccines/drugs in early stage clinical trials. Thechallenges of correlating immune responses induced by these drugs to clinicalefficacy will also be addressed.Crown Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
