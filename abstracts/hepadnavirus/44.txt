In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms of hepadnavirusreverse transcription and the biochemical and structural properties of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). We highlight important gaps in knowledge regardingcccDNA biosynthesis and stability. In addition, we discuss the impact of current antiviral therapies on viral persistence, particularly on cccDNA.Copyright Â© 2015 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.DOI: 10.1101/cshperspect.a021386 PMCID: PMC4484952PMID: 26134841  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
