Because commercially available assays differ in performance, we compared herein the performance of the Hologic AptimaHBV Quant assay (Aptima) to that of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV test for use with the high pure system (HPS/CTM).METHODS: Assay performance was assessed using HBV reference panels as well asplasma and serum samples from chronically HBV-infected patients. Methodcorrelation, analytical sensitivity, precision/reproducibility, linearity, biasand influence of genotype were evaluated. Data analysis was performed usinglinear regression, Deming correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis.RESULTS: Agreement between the assays for the two reference panels was good, witha difference in assay values vs. target <0.5 log. Qualitative assay results for159 clinical samples showed good concordance (88.1%; κ=0.75; 95% confidenceinterval: 0.651-0.845). For the 106 samples quantitated by both assays, viralload results were highly correlated (R=0.92) and differed on average by 0.09 log,with 95.3% of the samples being within the 95% limit of agreement of the assays. Linearity for viral loads 1-7 log was excellent for both assays (R2>0.98). Thetwo assays had similar bias and precision across the different genotypes testedat low viral loads (25-1000 IU/mL).CONCLUSIONS: Aptima has a performance comparable with that of HPS/CTM, making it suitable for use for HBV infection monitoring. Aptima runs on a fully automatedplatform (the Panther system) and therefore offers a significantly improvedworkflow compared with HPS/CTM.DOI: 10.1515/cclm-2017-0701 PMID: 29197859  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
