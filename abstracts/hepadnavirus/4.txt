BACKGROUND: Proper management of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection requires monitoring of plasma or serum HBV DNA levels using a highly
sensitive nucleic acid amplification test. Because commercially available assays 
differ in performance, we compared herein the performance of the Hologic Aptima
HBV Quant assay (Aptima) to that of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV test for use with 
the high pure system (HPS/CTM).
METHODS: Assay performance was assessed using HBV reference panels as well as
plasma and serum samples from chronically HBV-infected patients. Method
correlation, analytical sensitivity, precision/reproducibility, linearity, bias
and influence of genotype were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using
linear regression, Deming correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: Agreement between the assays for the two reference panels was good, with
a difference in assay values vs. target <0.5 log. Qualitative assay results for
159 clinical samples showed good concordance (88.1%; κ=0.75; 95% confidence
interval: 0.651-0.845). For the 106 samples quantitated by both assays, viral
load results were highly correlated (R=0.92) and differed on average by 0.09 log,
with 95.3% of the samples being within the 95% limit of agreement of the assays. 
Linearity for viral loads 1-7 log was excellent for both assays (R2>0.98). The
two assays had similar bias and precision across the different genotypes tested
at low viral loads (25-1000 IU/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: Aptima has a performance comparable with that of HPS/CTM, making it 
suitable for use for HBV infection monitoring. Aptima runs on a fully automated
platform (the Panther system) and therefore offers a significantly improved
workflow compared with HPS/CTM.
