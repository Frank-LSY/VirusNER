Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a recently
recognized disease entity defined by the presence of EBV in gastric carcinoma
cells. EBV infection causes major epigenetic alterations in the EBV genome and
its cellular host genome, suggesting that EBV acts as a direct epigenetic driver 
for EBVaGC. One of the major epigenetic events in the viral and cellular genomes 
to control transcription is DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation. Particularly, local
and global hypermethylation have been reported in EBVaGC. It is therefore
important to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA hypermethylation during
EBVaGC carcinogenesis. To understand the functional roles of DNA methylation and 
suggest therapeutic target candidates for EBVaGC, we reviewed recent literature
reporting DNA hypermethylation in EBVaGC. We summarized the identified candidate 
genes that are markedly hypermethylated in EBVaGC, which can potentially be
targets for chemotherapies with demethylating agents.
