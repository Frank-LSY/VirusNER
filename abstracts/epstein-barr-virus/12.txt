EBV infection causes major epigenetic alterations in the EBV genome andits cellular host genome, suggesting that EBV acts as a direct epigenetic driver for EBVaGC. One of the major epigenetic events in the viral and cellular genomes to control transcription is DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation. Particularly, localand global hypermethylation have been reported in EBVaGC. It is thereforeimportant to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA hypermethylation duringEBVaGC carcinogenesis. To understand the functional roles of DNA methylation and suggest therapeutic target candidates for EBVaGC, we reviewed recent literaturereporting DNA hypermethylation in EBVaGC. We summarized the identified candidate genes that are markedly hypermethylated in EBVaGC, which can potentially betargets for chemotherapies with demethylating agents.DOI: 10.1007/s12272-017-0939-5 PMID: 28779374  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
