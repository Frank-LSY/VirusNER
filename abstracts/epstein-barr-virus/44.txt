Electronic address:h.delecluse@dkfz.de.The Epstein-Barr virus encodes at least 44 microRNAs that are grouped in twoclusters located around the BHRF1 gene and within the BART transcript. Theexpression pattern of these microRNAs both depends on the lineage of the infectedcells and on the type of viral latency. Whilst BART microRNAs are expressed inall EBV-infected tumors, the BHRF1 locus is nearly exclusively expressed in cellsthat display a type III latency. However, the BART microRNA expression level isseveral orders of magnitude higher in epithelial cells than in B cells. Geneticstudies have demonstrated that the BHRF1 microRNA cluster enhances the initialphases of primary B cell transformation through inhibition of apoptosis. Asimilar role has been ascribed to the BART microRNAs although their contribution to this process seems more limited. These microRNAs also enhance the survival of B cell lymphoma cells. Using various strategies including high throughput assays,several groups have identified mRNAs targeted by the EBV microRNAs. Here wecompare the results of the published high throughput screens and review the viraland cellular genes thought to represent high confidence targets for the EBVmicroRNAs. Although genetic studies allow unequivocal evaluation of the functionsserved by the microRNAs, only a few key targets have been identified so far.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
