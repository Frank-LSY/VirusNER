The MEDLINE database was additionally queried from January 1, 1950 to April 1, 2015 for allreports of EBVMCU of the head and neck, and all pertinent clinical data wereextracted.RESULTS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and response of a patient withEBVMCU of the base of tongue are presented. Interim follow-up of the patient has revealed a complete remission with discontinuation of immunosuppression andrituximab therapy. A review of the literature supports conservative managementand reduction of immunosuppression. Overall, 96.6% of patients with follow-upgreater than 2 months achieved complete remission with conservative management.The current study is the largest series to report on the clinical presentationand treatment outcomes of EBVMCU of the head and neck.CONCLUSIONS: EBVMCU tends to follow an indolent and self-limiting clinicalcourse, responding to reduction of immunosuppression and conservative treatment. It is imperative for clinicians to consider EBVMCU in the differential diagnosis of mucocutaneous ulcers of the head and neck to avoid excessive treatment.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Laryngoscope, 126:2500-2504, 2016.Â© 2016 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/lary.26009 PMID: 27113560  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
