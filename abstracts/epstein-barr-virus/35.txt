What is wild-type Epstein-Barr virus and are there genetic differences in EBV
strains that contribute to some of the EBV-associated diseases? Recent progress
in DNA sequencing has resulted in many new Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome
sequences becoming available. EBV isolates worldwide can be grouped into type 1
and type 2, a classification based on the EBNA2 gene sequence. Type 1 transforms 
human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines much more efficiently than type 2
EBV and molecular mechanisms that may account for this difference in cell
transformation are now becoming understood. Study of geographic variation of EBV 
strains independent of the type 1/type 2 classification and systematic
investigation of the relationship between viral strains, infection and disease
are now becoming possible. So we should consider more directly whether viral
sequence variation might play a role in the incidence of some EBV-associated
diseases.
