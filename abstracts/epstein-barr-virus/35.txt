Recent progressin DNA sequencing has resulted in many new Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomesequences becoming available. EBV isolates worldwide can be grouped into type 1and type 2, a classification based on the EBNA2 gene sequence. Type 1 transforms human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines much more efficiently than type 2EBV and molecular mechanisms that may account for this difference in celltransformation are now becoming understood. Study of geographic variation of EBV strains independent of the type 1/type 2 classification and systematicinvestigation of the relationship between viral strains, infection and diseaseare now becoming possible. So we should consider more directly whether viralsequence variation might play a role in the incidence of some EBV-associateddiseases.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22822-8_4 PMID: 26424643  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
