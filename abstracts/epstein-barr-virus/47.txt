Positive studies show staining in thenuclei of the EBV-infected cells, accentuating the chromatin and often excluding the nucleolus. False-negative results are most often the result of RNAdegradation in the tissues, a finding that may be detected through the use of apolyT probe as a control for RNA preservation.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-62703-357-2_16 PMID: 23666702  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
