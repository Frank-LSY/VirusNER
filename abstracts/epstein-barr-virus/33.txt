The virus possesses a 170-kb-largegenome that encodes for multiple proteins and non-coding RNAs. Early on therehave been numerous attempts to link particular diseases with particular EBVstrains, or at least with viral genetic polymorphisms. This has given rise to awealth of information whose value has been difficult to evaluate for at leastfour reasons. First, most studies have looked only at one particular gene andmissed the global picture. Second, they usually have not studied sufficientnumbers of diseased and control cases to reach robust statistical significance.Third, the functional significance of most polymorphisms has remained unclear,although there are exceptions such as the 30-bp deletion in LMP1. Fourth,different biological properties of the virus do not necessarily equate with adifferent pathogenicity. This was best illustrated by the type 1 and type 2viruses that markedly differ in terms of their transformation abilities, yet donot seem to cause different diseases. Reciprocally, environmental and geneticfactors in the host are likely to influence the outcome of infections with thesame virus type. However, with recent developments in recombinant virustechnology and in the availability of high throughput sequencing, the tide is nowturning. The availability of 23 complete or nearly complete genomes has led tothe recognition of viral subtypes, some of which possess nearly identicalgenotypes. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that some genetic polymorphismsamong EBV strains markedly influence the biological and clinical behavior of the virus. Some virus strains are endowed with biological properties that explaincrucial clinical features of patients with EBV-associated diseases. Although wenow have a better overview of the genetic diversity within EBV genomes, it hasalso become clear that defining phenotypic traits evinced by cells infected bydifferent viruses usually result from the combination of multiple polymorphismsthat will be difficult to identify in their entirety. However, the steadilyincreasing number of sequenced EBV genomes and cloned EBV BACS from diseased and healthy patients will facilitate the identification of the key polymorphisms thatcondition the biological and clinical behavior of the viruses. This will allowthe development of preventative and therapeutic approaches against highlypathogenic viral strains.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22822-8_7 PMID: 26424646  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
