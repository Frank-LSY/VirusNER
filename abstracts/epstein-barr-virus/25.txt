Epstein-Barr Virus.

Nowalk A, Green M.

This review covers relevant clinical and laboratory information relating to
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in immunocompromised hosts. It describes the 
epidemiology and clinical manifestations with a primary focus on disease in solid
organ and stem cell transplant recipients. The review pays particular attention
to diagnostic approaches, including serologic testing and imaging, with an
expanded discussion on the role of measuring the EBV load in peripheral blood,
identifying both strengths and limitations of this assay. Additional attention is
paid to potential additional strategies of immunologic monitoring that may
enhance the performance of EBV load monitoring.
