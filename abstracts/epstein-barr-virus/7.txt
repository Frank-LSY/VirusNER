Electronic address:Bryan.cullen@duke.edu.The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) miR-BHRF1 microRNA (miRNA) cluster has been shown tofacilitate B-cell transformation and promote the rapid growth of the resultantlymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). However, we find that expression ofphysiological levels of the miR-BHRF1 miRNAs in LCLs transformed with a miR-BHRF1null mutant (∆123) fails to increase their growth rate. We demonstrate that thepri-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 stem-loops are present in the 3'UTR of transcriptsencoding EBNA-LP and that excision of pre-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 by Droshadestabilizes these mRNAs and reduces expression of the encoded protein.Therefore, mutational inactivation of pri-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 in the ∆123 mutant upregulates the expression of not only EBNA-LP but also EBNA-LP-regulated mRNAsand proteins, including LMP1. We hypothesize that this overexpression causes the reduced transformation capacity of the ∆123 EBV mutant. Thus, in addition toregulating cellular mRNAs in trans, miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 also regulate EBNA-LPmRNA expression in cis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
