The difficulties encountered ininfecting and transforming primary epithelial cells in experimental systemssuggest that the role of EBV in epithelial malignancies is complex andmultifactorial in nature. Genetic alterations in the premalignant epithelium may support the establishment of latent EBV infection, which is believed to be aninitiation event. Oncogenic properties have been reported in multiple EBV latent genes. The BamH1 A rightwards transcripts (BARTs) and the BART-encoded microRNAs (miR-BARTs) are highly expressed in EBV-associated epithelial malignancies andmay induce malignant transformation. However, enhanced proliferation may not bethe crucial function of EBV infection in epithelial malignancies, at least in theearly stages of cancer development. EBV-encoded gene products may conferanti-apoptotic properties and promote the survival of infected premalignantepithelial cells harbouring genetic alterations. Multiple EBV-encoded microRNAshave been reported to have immune evasion functions. Genetic alterations in host cells, as well as inflammatory stroma, could modulate the expression of EBV genesand alter the growth properties of infected premalignant epithelial cells,encouraging their selection during carcinogenesis.Â© 2014 The Authors.
