Electronic address: lhuttf@lsuhsc.edu.The Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein complex gMgN has been implicated in assembly and release of fully enveloped virus, although the precise role that it plays hasnot been elucidated. We report here that the long predicted cytoplasmic tail ofgM is not required for complex formation and that it interacts with the cellular protein p32, which has been reported to be involved in nuclear egress of humancytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Although redistribution of p32 andcolocalization with gM was not observed in virus infected cells, knockdown of p32expression by siRNA or lentivirus-delivered shRNA recapitulated the phenotype of a virus lacking expression of gNgM. A proportion of virus released from cellssedimented with characteristics of virus lacking an intact envelope and there wasan increase in virus trapped in nuclear condensed chromatin. The observationssuggest the possibility that p32 may also be involved in nuclear egress ofEpstein-Barr virus.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.
