In this study we propose a noise-tolerant homologknowledge transfer method to reconstruct functional protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks between Epstein-Barr virus and Homo sapiens. The training set isaugmented via homolog instances and the homolog noise is counteracted by support vector machine (SVM). Additionally we propose two methods to define subcellularco-localization (i.e. stringent and relaxed), based on which to further derivephysical PPI networks. Computational results show that the proposed methodachieves sound performance of cross validation and independent test. In the spaceof 648,672 EBV-human protein pairs, we obtain 51,485 functional interactions(7.94%), 869 stringent physical PPIs and 46,050 relaxed physical PPIs.Fifty-eight evidences are found from the latest database and recent literature tovalidate the model. This study reveals that Epstein-Barr virus interferes withnormal human cell life, such as cholesterol homeostasis, blood coagulation, EGFR binding, p53 binding, Notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, etc. The proteome-widepredictions are provided in the supplementary file for further biomedicalresearch.DOI: 10.1038/srep30612 PMCID: PMC4965740PMID: 27470517  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
