Electronic address: christian.muenz@uzh.ch.Epstein Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus to be described. Despiteits discovery now more than fifty years ago, immune control of this virus isstill not very well understood and no vaccine is available. This knowledge gap isdue in part to the lack of a preclinical small animal model which can faithfully recapitulate EBV infection and immune control, and would allow testing of EBVspecific vaccine candidates. With the advent of mice with reconstituted humanimmune system compartments (HIS mice) during the past decade this is changing. Wewill discuss which aspects of EBV infection and its immune control can already bemodeled in HIS mice, and which shortcomings still need to be overcome in order torecapitulate the immunobiology of oncogenic EBV infection.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
