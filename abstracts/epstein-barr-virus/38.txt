Epstein Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus to be described. Despite
its discovery now more than fifty years ago, immune control of this virus is
still not very well understood and no vaccine is available. This knowledge gap is
due in part to the lack of a preclinical small animal model which can faithfully 
recapitulate EBV infection and immune control, and would allow testing of EBV
specific vaccine candidates. With the advent of mice with reconstituted human
immune system compartments (HIS mice) during the past decade this is changing. We
will discuss which aspects of EBV infection and its immune control can already be
modeled in HIS mice, and which shortcomings still need to be overcome in order to
recapitulate the immunobiology of oncogenic EBV infection.
