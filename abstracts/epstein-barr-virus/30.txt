Humoral immune responses to EBV have been studied for diagnostic,pathogenic and protective (vaccine) purposes. These studies use a range ofmethodologies, from cell-based immunofluorescence testing to antibody-diversityanalysis using immunoblot and epitope analysis using recombinant or syntheticpeptide-scanning. First, the individual EBV antigen complexes (VCA , MA, EA(D),EA(R) and EBNA) are defined at cellular and molecular levels, providing ahistoric overview. The characteristic antibody responses to these complexes inhealth and disease are described, and differences are highlighted by clinicalexamples. Options for EBV vaccination are briefly addressed. For a selectednumber of immunodominant proteins, in particular EBNA1, the interaction withhuman antibodies is further detailed at the epitope level, revealing interesting insights for structure, function and immunological aspects, not consideredpreviously. Humoral immune responses against EBV-encoded tumour antigens LMP1,LMP2 and BARF1 are addressed, which provide novel options for targetedimmunotherapy. Finally, some considerations on EBV-linked autoimmune diseases aregiven, and mechanisms of antigen mimicry are briefly discussed. Further analysis of humoral immune responses against EBV in health and disease in carefullyselected patient cohorts will open new options for understanding pathogenesis of individual EBV-linked diseases and developing targeted diagnostic and therapeuticapproaches.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22834-1_10 PMID: 26428379  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
