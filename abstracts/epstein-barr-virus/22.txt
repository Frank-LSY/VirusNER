Transmitted through infected saliva, EBV is the causative agent ofinfectious mononucleosis (IM) and is further implicated in malignancies oflymphoid and epithelial origins. In the past few decades, research effortsprimarily focused on dissecting the mechanism of EBV-induced oncogenesis. Here,we present an alternate facet of the oncovirus EBV, on its applications inresearch and therapy. Finally, discussions on the prospective utilization of EBV in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) diagnosis and therapy will also be presented.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
