Some Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseasesare uniquely prevalent in populations with different geographic origins. However,the features of the disease and geographically associated Epstein-Barr virusgenetic variation as well as the roles that the variation plays in carcinogenesisand evolution remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we sequenced 95geographically distinct Epstein-Barr virus isolates from Epstein-Barrvirus-associated gastric carcinoma biopsies and saliva of healthy donors todetect variants and genes associated with gastric carcinoma and populationstructure from a genome-wide spectrum. We demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virusrevealed the population structure between North China and South China. Inaddition, we observed population stratification between Epstein-Barr virusstrains from gastric carcinoma and healthy controls, indicating that certainEpstein-Barr virus subtypes are associated with different gastric carcinomarisks. We identified that the BRLF1, BBRF3, and BBLF2/BBLF3 genes had significantassociations with gastric carcinoma. LMP1 and BNLF2a genes were stronglygeographically associated genes in Epstein-Barr virus. Our study providesinsights into the genetic basis of oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus for gastriccarcinoma, and the genetic variants associated with gastric carcinoma can serveas biomarkers for oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus.DOI: 10.1177/1010428317714195 PMID: 29034771  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
