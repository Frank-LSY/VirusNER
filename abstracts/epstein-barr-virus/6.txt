Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous virus and is associated with several human
malignances, including the significant subset of gastric carcinoma, Epstein-Barr 
virus-associated gastric carcinoma. Some Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases
are uniquely prevalent in populations with different geographic origins. However,
the features of the disease and geographically associated Epstein-Barr virus
genetic variation as well as the roles that the variation plays in carcinogenesis
and evolution remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we sequenced 95
geographically distinct Epstein-Barr virus isolates from Epstein-Barr
virus-associated gastric carcinoma biopsies and saliva of healthy donors to
detect variants and genes associated with gastric carcinoma and population
structure from a genome-wide spectrum. We demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus
revealed the population structure between North China and South China. In
addition, we observed population stratification between Epstein-Barr virus
strains from gastric carcinoma and healthy controls, indicating that certain
Epstein-Barr virus subtypes are associated with different gastric carcinoma
risks. We identified that the BRLF1, BBRF3, and BBLF2/BBLF3 genes had significant
associations with gastric carcinoma. LMP1 and BNLF2a genes were strongly
geographically associated genes in Epstein-Barr virus. Our study provides
insights into the genetic basis of oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus for gastric
carcinoma, and the genetic variants associated with gastric carcinoma can serve
as biomarkers for oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus.
