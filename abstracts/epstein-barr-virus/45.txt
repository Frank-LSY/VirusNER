EBV infection is seen in many oncologicalconditions, although there is controversy regarding whether EBV is causative, acofactor, or just a coincidental infection. Some of these conditions involve the skin as the main or as a secondary organ. In this report, we review severaltumoral and nontumoral cutaneous conditions, which are related to EBV infection, and describe the epidemiology of infection and the life cycle of the virus.DOI: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e318287e0c6 PMID: 24257189  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
