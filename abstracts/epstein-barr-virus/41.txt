Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is present in the malignant
Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of a proportion of cases of classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL), how the virus contributes to the pathogenesis of this disease
remains poorly defined. It is clear from the studies of other EBV-associated
cancers that the virus is usually not sufficient for tumor development and that
other oncogenic co-factors are required. This article reviews what is known about
the contribution of EBV to the pathogenesis of cHL and focuses on emerging
evidence implicating chronic inflammation as a potential oncogenic co-factor in
this malignancy.
