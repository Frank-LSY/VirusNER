It is clear from the studies of other EBV-associatedcancers that the virus is usually not sufficient for tumor development and thatother oncogenic co-factors are required. This article reviews what is known aboutthe contribution of EBV to the pathogenesis of cHL and focuses on emergingevidence implicating chronic inflammation as a potential oncogenic co-factor inthis malignancy.DOI: 10.5732/cjc.014.10193 PMCID: PMC4308654PMID: 25418190  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
