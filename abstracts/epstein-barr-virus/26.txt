In a systematic review thatinvestigated studies published until September 2014, the authors did notcalculate the summary odds ratio (SOR) due to heterogeneity across studies.Therefore, we include here additional studies published until October 2015 andconduct a meta-analysis with meta-regression that controls for the heterogeneity among studies.METHODS: Using the studies selected in the previously published systematicreview, we formulated lists of references, cited articles, and related articlesprovided by PubMed. From the lists, only case-control studies that detected EBVin tissue samples were selected. In order to control for the heterogeneity among studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed.RESULTS: In the 33 case-control results with adjacent non-cancer tissue, thetotal number of test samples in the case and control groups was 5280 and 4962,respectively. In the 14 case-control results with normal tissue, the total numberof test samples in case and control groups was 1393 and 945, respectively. Uponmeta-regression, the type of control tissue was found to be a statisticallysignificant variable with regard to heterogeneity. When the control tissue wasnormal tissue of healthy individuals, the SOR was 3.41 (95% CI, 1.78 to 6.51;I-squared, 65.5%).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the argument that EBVinfection increases the risk of gastric cancer. In the future, age-matched andsex-matched case-control studies should be conducted.DOI: 10.3961/jpmph.15.068 PMCID: PMC4829373PMID: 27055546  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
