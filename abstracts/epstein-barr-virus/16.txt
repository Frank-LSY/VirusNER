This latent infection lasts a lifetime. However, EBV can infect T or NK cells (T/NK cells) in rare cases. Therefore, EBV causes various hematologicaldiseases. Among these diseases, CAEBV is regarded as the most problematicbecause, although it is not particularly uncommon, the diagnostic tests for this disease are not covered by health insurance, a serious illness in the"non-active" periods is lacking, and the appropriate motivation for earlyinitiation of treatment can easily be lost. However, the symptoms may suddenlychange; and if the manifestations are resistant when such exacerbation occurs,CAEBC is potentially lethal. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) is the only cure. Once the diagnosis has been made, earlier treatmentinitiation, safer bridging to allogeneic HSCT with multi-drug chemotherapy, andthen, planned HSCT can be completed more safely and thereby achieve a betteroutcome.DOI: 10.11406/rinketsu.57.2267 PMID: 27795539  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
