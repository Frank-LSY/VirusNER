Recentstudies suggested Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis ofperiodontitis. We investigated the association between EBV and Porphyromonasgingivalis in Japanese PI patients.METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy individuals, 15 healthy implant patientsand 15 PI patients were recruited. Forty five subgingival plaque samples werecollected from the deepest probing pocket depth (PPD) site from each patient.Real-time PCR was used to detect EBV DNA and P. gingivalis.RESULTS: EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in 7 and 3 PPD sites of the healthy controls, in 9 and 4 PPD sites of the healthy implants, and in 13 and 14 PPDsites of the PI patients. P. gingivalis and coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis were detected significantly higher in the PI patients than healthy controls andhealthy implant patients. EBV was detected significantly higher in the PIpatients than healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in PPD sites ofPI patients. These results suggest that coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis may serve pathogenic factors cause for PI in Japanese dental patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12903-017-0438-6 PMCID: PMC5727789PMID: 29233156  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
