BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis (PI) is an inflammatory reaction associated with
functional deterioration of supporting bones around the dental implant. Recent
studies suggested Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of
periodontitis. We investigated the association between EBV and Porphyromonas
gingivalis in Japanese PI patients.
METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy individuals, 15 healthy implant patients
and 15 PI patients were recruited. Forty five subgingival plaque samples were
collected from the deepest probing pocket depth (PPD) site from each patient.
Real-time PCR was used to detect EBV DNA and P. gingivalis.
RESULTS: EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in 7 and 3 PPD sites of the healthy 
controls, in 9 and 4 PPD sites of the healthy implants, and in 13 and 14 PPD
sites of the PI patients. P. gingivalis and coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis 
were detected significantly higher in the PI patients than healthy controls and
healthy implant patients. EBV was detected significantly higher in the PI
patients than healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in PPD sites of
PI patients. These results suggest that coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis may 
serve pathogenic factors cause for PI in Japanese dental patients.
