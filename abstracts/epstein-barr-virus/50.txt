Nat Rev Immunol. 2001 Oct;1(1):75-82.Epstein-Barr virus: exploiting the immune system.Thorley-Lawson DA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston,Massachusetts 02111, USA. david.thorley-lawson@tufts.eduIn vitro, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will infect any resting B cell, driving it outof the resting state to become an activated proliferating lymphoblast.Paradoxically, EBV persists in vivo in a quiescent state in resting memory Bcells that circulate in the peripheral blood. How does the virus get there, andwith such specificity for the memory compartment? An explanation comes from theidea that two genes encoded by the virus--LMP1 and LMP2A--allow EBV to exploitthe normal pathways of B-cell differentiation so that the EBV-infected B blastcan become a resting memory cell.DOI: 10.1038/35095584 PMID: 11905817  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
