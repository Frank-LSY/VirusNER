In vitro, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will infect any resting B cell, driving it out
of the resting state to become an activated proliferating lymphoblast.
Paradoxically, EBV persists in vivo in a quiescent state in resting memory B
cells that circulate in the peripheral blood. How does the virus get there, and
with such specificity for the memory compartment? An explanation comes from the
idea that two genes encoded by the virus--LMP1 and LMP2A--allow EBV to exploit
the normal pathways of B-cell differentiation so that the EBV-infected B blast
can become a resting memory cell.
