Determination of type 1 and type 2 EBV in salivasamples from people from a wide range of geographic and ethnic backgroundsdemonstrates a small percentage of healthy white Caucasian British peoplecarrying predominantly type 2 EBV. Linkage of Zp and gp350 variants to type 2 EBVis likely to be due to their genes being adjacent to the EBNA3 locus, which isone of the major determinants of the type 1/type 2 distinction. A novelclassification of EBNA1 DNA binding domains, named QCIGP, results from phylogeny analysis of their protein sequences but is not linked to the type 1/type 2classification. The BART cluster 2 miRNA region is classified into three majorvariants through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the primary miRNAoutside the mature miRNA sequences. These SNPs can result in altered levels ofexpression of some miRNAs from the BART variant frequently present in Chinese andIndonesian nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) samples. The EBV genetic variantsidentified here provide a basis for future, more directed analysis of associationof specific EBV variations with EBV biology and EBV-associateddiseases.IMPORTANCE Incidence of diseases associated with EBV varies greatly indifferent parts of the world. Thus, relationships between EBV genome sequencevariation and health, disease, geography, and ethnicity of the host may beimportant for understanding the role of EBV in diseases and for development of aneffective EBV vaccine. This paper provides the most comprehensive analysis so farof variation in specific EBV genes relevant to these diseases and proposed EBVvaccines. By focusing on variation in LMP1, Zp, gp350, EBNA1, and the BART miRNA cluster 2, new relationships with the known type 1/type 2 strains aredemonstrated, and a novel classification of EBNA1 and the BART miRNAs isproposed.Copyright © 2017 Correia et al.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00375-17 PMCID: PMC5512239PMID: 28515295  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
