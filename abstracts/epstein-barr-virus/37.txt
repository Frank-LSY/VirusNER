Electronic address: iwakiri@igm.hokudai.ac.jp.Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known as an oncogenic herpesvirus implicated in thepathogenesis of various malignancies. It has been reported that EBV non-codingRNAs (ncRNAs) including EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and EBV-miRNAs contribute to viral pathogenesis. EBERs that are expressed abundantly in latentlyEBV-infected cells have been reported to play significant roles in tumorigenesis by EBV. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the modulation of host innateimmune signals by EBERs contributes to EBV-mediated pathogenesis includingoncogenesis. Recently it was demonstrated that EBERs are secreted via exosomes byEBV-infected cells. It was also demonstrated that exosomes contain a number ofEBV-encoded miRNAs. Various mRNAs have been identified as targets for regulation by EBV-miRNAs in host cells, therefore, EBERs and EBV-miRNAs might functionthrough the transfer of exosomes.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
