Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known as an oncogenic herpesvirus implicated in the
pathogenesis of various malignancies. It has been reported that EBV non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) including EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and EBV-miRNAs contribute 
to viral pathogenesis. EBERs that are expressed abundantly in latently
EBV-infected cells have been reported to play significant roles in tumorigenesis 
by EBV. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the modulation of host innate
immune signals by EBERs contributes to EBV-mediated pathogenesis including
oncogenesis. Recently it was demonstrated that EBERs are secreted via exosomes by
EBV-infected cells. It was also demonstrated that exosomes contain a number of
EBV-encoded miRNAs. Various mRNAs have been identified as targets for regulation 
by EBV-miRNAs in host cells, therefore, EBERs and EBV-miRNAs might function
through the transfer of exosomes.
