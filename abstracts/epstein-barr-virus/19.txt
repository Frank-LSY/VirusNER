Real-time PCR identifiedseveral highly induced (>90-fold) EBV lytic genes over a 48 h time course during the lytic induction phase. Latent genes were induced at low levels during thisphase. The cellular response to lytic viral replication is poorly understood.Whole human genome microarray analysis identified 113 cellular genes regulatedtwofold or more by EBV, including 63 upregulated and 46 downregulated genes, overa 24 h time course post-induction. The most upregulated gene was CHI3L1, achitinase-3-like 1 protein (18.1-fold; P<0.0084), and the most downregulated genewas TYMS, a thymidylate synthetase (-7.6-fold). Gene Ontology enrichment analysisusing MetaCore software revealed cell cycle (core), cell cycle (role ofanaphase-promoting complex) in cell cycle regulation) and lymphatic diseases asthe most significantly represented biological network processes, canonicalpathways and disease biomarkers, respectively. Chemotaxis, DNA damage andinflammation (IL-4 signalling) together with lymphoproliferative disorders andnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma were significantly represented biological processes anddisease biomarkers.DOI: 10.1099/jmm.0.000352 PMID: 27625030  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
