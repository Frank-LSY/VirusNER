Electronic address: v.bolis7@gmail.com.(2)Child Health Department, University Hospital of Ioannina (UHI), Ioannina,Greece.OBJECTIVE: Clarify the frequency and the pathophysiological mechanisms of therare manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus infection.SOURCES: Original research studies published in English between 1985 and 2015were selected through a computer-assisted literature search (PubMed and Scopus). Computer searches used combinations of key words relating to "EBV infections" and"atypical manifestation."SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Epstein-Barr virus is a herpes virus responsible for alifelong latent infection in almost every adult. The primary infection concernsmostly children and presents with the clinical syndrome of infectiousmononucleosis. However, Epstein-Barr virus infection may exhibit numerous rare,atypical and threatening manifestations. It may cause secondary infections andvarious complications of the respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary,gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Epstein-Barr virus also plays asignificant role in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, allergies, andneoplasms, with Burkitt lymphoma as the main representative of the latter. Themechanisms of these manifestations are still unresolved. Therefore, the mainsuggestions are direct viral invasion and chronic immune response due to thereactivation of the latent state of the virus, or even various DNA mutations.CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be cautious about uncommon presentations of theviral infection and consider EBV as a causative agent when they encounter similarclinical pictures.Copyright Â© 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.
