OBJECTIVE: Clarify the frequency and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the
rare manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus infection.
SOURCES: Original research studies published in English between 1985 and 2015
were selected through a computer-assisted literature search (PubMed and Scopus). 
Computer searches used combinations of key words relating to "EBV infections" and
"atypical manifestation."
SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Epstein-Barr virus is a herpes virus responsible for a
lifelong latent infection in almost every adult. The primary infection concerns
mostly children and presents with the clinical syndrome of infectious
mononucleosis. However, Epstein-Barr virus infection may exhibit numerous rare,
atypical and threatening manifestations. It may cause secondary infections and
various complications of the respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary,
gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Epstein-Barr virus also plays a
significant role in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and
neoplasms, with Burkitt lymphoma as the main representative of the latter. The
mechanisms of these manifestations are still unresolved. Therefore, the main
suggestions are direct viral invasion and chronic immune response due to the
reactivation of the latent state of the virus, or even various DNA mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be cautious about uncommon presentations of the
viral infection and consider EBV as a causative agent when they encounter similar
clinical pictures.
