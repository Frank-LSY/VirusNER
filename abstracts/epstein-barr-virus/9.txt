Like other herpesviruses, EBV hasdiversified through both coevolution with its host and genetic exchange betweenvirus strains. Sequence analysis of the EBV genome is unusually challengingbecause of the large number and lengths of repeat regions within the virus. Here we describe the sequence assembly and analysis of the large internal repeat 1 of EBV (IR1; also known as the BamW repeats) for more than 70 strains. The diversityof the latency protein EBV nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) residespredominantly within the exons downstream of IR1. The integrity of the putativeBWRF1 open reading frame (ORF) is retained in over 80% of strains, and deletions truncating IR1 always spare BWRF1. Conserved regions include the IR1 latencypromoter (Wp) and one zone upstream of and two within BWRF1. IR1 is heterogeneousin 70% of strains, and this heterogeneity arises from sequence exchange betweenstrains as well as from spontaneous mutation, with interstrain recombinationbeing more common in tumor-derived viruses. This genetic exchange oftenincorporates regions of <1 kb, and allelic gene conversion changes the frequency of small regions within the repeat but not close to the flanks. Theseobservations suggest that IR1-and, by extension, EBV-diversifies through bothrecombination and breakpoint repair, while concerted evolution of IR1 is drivenby gene conversion of small regions. Finally, the prototype EBV strain B95-8contains four nonconsensus variants within a single IR1 repeat unit, including a stop codon in the EBNA-LP gene. Repairing IR1 improves EBNA-LP levels and thequality of transformation by the B95-8 bacterial artificial chromosome(BAC).IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the majority of the worldpopulation but causes illness in only a small minority of people. Nevertheless,over 1% of cancers worldwide are attributable to EBV. Recent sequencing projects investigating virus diversity to see if different strains have different disease impacts have excluded regions of repeating sequence, as they are more technicallychallenging. Here we analyze the sequence of the largest repeat in EBV (IR1). We first characterized the variations in protein sequences encoded across IR1. Instudying variations within the repeat of each strain, we identified a mutation inthe main laboratory strain of EBV that impairs virus function, and we suggestthat tumor-associated viruses may be more likely to contain DNA mixed from twostrains. The patterns of this mixing suggest that sequences can spread betweenstrains (and also within the repeat) by copying sequence from another strain (or repeat unit) to repair DNA damage.Copyright Â© 2017 Ba abdullah et al.DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00920-17 PMCID: PMC5686732PMID: 28904201  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
