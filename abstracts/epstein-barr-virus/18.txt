Wesequenced 27 complete EBV genomes from a cohort of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)patients and healthy controls from Italy, although no variants showed astatistically significant association with MS. Taking advantage of theavailability of ∼130 EBV genomes with known geographical origins, we reveal astriking geographic distribution of EBV sub-populations with distinct allelefrequency distributions. We discuss mechanisms that potentially explain theseobservations, and their implications for understanding the association of EBVwith human disease.© The Author 2016.
