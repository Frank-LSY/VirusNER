Moreover, transmission of EBV through the placenta has been reported.However, the focus of EBV infection within the placenta has remained unknown todate. In this study, we proved the expression of latent EBV genes in theendometrial glandular epithelial cells of the placenta and investigated thecytological characteristics of these cells. Sixty-eight placentas were obtainedfrom pregnant women. Tissue microarray was constructed. EBV latent genesincluding EBV-encoding RNA-1 (EBER1), Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1(EBNA1), late membrane antigen (LMP1), and RPMS1 were detected with silver insitu hybridization and/or mRNA in situ hybridization. Nuclear features ofEBV-positive cells in EBV-infected placenta were compared with those ofEBV-negative cells via image analysis. Sixteen placentas (23.5%) showed positive expression of all 4 EBV latent genes; only the glandular epithelial cells of the decidua showed EBV gene expression. EBV infection status was not significantlycorrelated with maternal, fetal, or placental factors. The nuclei of EBV-positivecells were significantly larger, longer, and round-shaped than those ofEBV-negative cells regardless of EBV-infection status of the placenta. For thefirst time, evidence of EBV gene expression has been shown in placental tissues. Furthermore, we have characterized its cytological features, allowing screeningof EBV infection through microscopic examination.Â© 2017 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2017.32.12.1959 PMCID: PMC5680494PMID: 29115077  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
