Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common pathogen in humans, is suspected as the cause 
of multiple pregnancy-related pathologies including depression, preeclampsia, and
stillbirth. Moreover, transmission of EBV through the placenta has been reported.
However, the focus of EBV infection within the placenta has remained unknown to
date. In this study, we proved the expression of latent EBV genes in the
endometrial glandular epithelial cells of the placenta and investigated the
cytological characteristics of these cells. Sixty-eight placentas were obtained
from pregnant women. Tissue microarray was constructed. EBV latent genes
including EBV-encoding RNA-1 (EBER1), Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1
(EBNA1), late membrane antigen (LMP1), and RPMS1 were detected with silver in
situ hybridization and/or mRNA in situ hybridization. Nuclear features of
EBV-positive cells in EBV-infected placenta were compared with those of
EBV-negative cells via image analysis. Sixteen placentas (23.5%) showed positive 
expression of all 4 EBV latent genes; only the glandular epithelial cells of the 
decidua showed EBV gene expression. EBV infection status was not significantly
correlated with maternal, fetal, or placental factors. The nuclei of EBV-positive
cells were significantly larger, longer, and round-shaped than those of
EBV-negative cells regardless of EBV-infection status of the placenta. For the
first time, evidence of EBV gene expression has been shown in placental tissues. 
Furthermore, we have characterized its cytological features, allowing screening
of EBV infection through microscopic examination.
