Forexample, the capacity for efficient productive infection of cultured cells byherpes simplex virus 1 has made it a paradigm for this mode of infection forherpesviruses in general. Epstein-Barr virus, another herpesvirus, has twoproperties that have driven its study: It causes human cancers, and it exhibits atractable transition from its latent to its productive cycle in cell culture.Here, we review our understanding of the path Epstein-Barr virus follows to move from a latent infection to and through its productive cycle. We use informationfrom human infections to provide a framework for describing studies in cellculture and, where possible, the molecular resolutions from these studies. Wealso pose questions whose answers we think are pivotal to understanding thispath, and we provide answers where we can.DOI: 10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042358 PMID: 27578440  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
