EBV infection is associated with multiple human cancers, includingBurkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, a subset of gastric carcinomas, andalmost all undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Intensive research has shown that EBV triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) during primaryinfection and lytic reactivation. The EBV-encoded viral proteins have beenimplicated in deregulating the DDR signaling pathways. The consequences of DDRinactivation lead to genomic instability and promote cellular transformation.This review summarizes the current understanding of the relationship between EBV infection and the DDR transducers, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated),ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), anddiscusses how EBV manipulates the DDR signaling pathways to complete thereplication process of viral DNA during lytic reactivation.DOI: 10.3390/v9110341 PMCID: PMC5707548PMID: 29144413  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
