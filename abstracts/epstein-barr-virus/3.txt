The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus that infects most of the human
population. EBV infection is associated with multiple human cancers, including
Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, a subset of gastric carcinomas, and
almost all undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Intensive 
research has shown that EBV triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) during primary
infection and lytic reactivation. The EBV-encoded viral proteins have been
implicated in deregulating the DDR signaling pathways. The consequences of DDR
inactivation lead to genomic instability and promote cellular transformation.
This review summarizes the current understanding of the relationship between EBV 
infection and the DDR transducers, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated),
ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), and
discusses how EBV manipulates the DDR signaling pathways to complete the
replication process of viral DNA during lytic reactivation.
