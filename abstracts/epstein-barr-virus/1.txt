Technologies used for genome analysis and whole genome sequencing are useful for 
us to understand genomic characterization and divergence. The Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) is an oncogenic virus that causes diverse diseases such as Burkitt's
lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and
gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV genomes found in these diseases can be classified
either by phases of EBV latency (type-I, -II, and -III latency) or types of EBNA2
sequence difference (type-I EBV, type-II EBV or EBV-1, EBV-2). EBV from
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) establishes type-III latency, EBV 
from NPC establishes type-II latency, and EBV from GC establishes type-I latency.
However, other important factors play key roles in classifying numerous EBV
strains because EBV genomes are highly diverse and not phylogenetically related
to types of EBV-associated diseases. Herein, we first reviewed previous studies
to describe molecular characteristics of EBV genomes. Then, using comparative and
phylogenetic analyses, we phylogenetically analyzed molecular variations of EBV
genomes and proteins. The review of previous studies and our phylogenetic
analysis showed that EBV genomes and proteins were highly diverse regardless of
types of EBV-associated diseases. Other factors should be considered in
determining EBV taxonomy. This review will be helpful to understand complicated
phylogenetic relationships of EBV genomes.
