Background: The 2 strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV type 1 (EBV-1) and
EBV-2, differ in latency genes, suggesting that they use distinct mechanisms to
establish latency. We previously reported that EBV-2 infects T cells in vitro. In
this study, we tested the possibility that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo.
Methods: Purified T-cell fractions isolated from children positive for EBV-1 or
EBV-2 and their mothers were examined for the presence of EBV and for EBV type.
Results: We detected EBV-2 in all T-cell samples obtained from EBV-2-infected
children at 12 months of age, with some children retaining EBV-2-positive T cells
through 24 months of age, suggesting that EBV-2 persists in T cells. We were
unable to detect EBV-2 in T-cell samples from mothers but could detect EBV-2 in
samples of their breast milk and saliva.
Conclusions: These data suggest that EBV-2 uses T cells as an additional latency 
reservoir but that, over time, the frequency of infected T cells may drop below
detectable levels. Alternatively, EBV-2 may establish a prolonged transient
infection in the T-cell compartment. Collectively, these novel findings
demonstrate that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo and suggest EBV-2 may use the
T-cell compartment to establish latency.
