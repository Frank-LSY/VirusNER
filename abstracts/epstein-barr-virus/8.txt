We previously reported that EBV-2 infects T cells in vitro. Inthis study, we tested the possibility that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo.Methods: Purified T-cell fractions isolated from children positive for EBV-1 orEBV-2 and their mothers were examined for the presence of EBV and for EBV type.Results: We detected EBV-2 in all T-cell samples obtained from EBV-2-infectedchildren at 12 months of age, with some children retaining EBV-2-positive T cellsthrough 24 months of age, suggesting that EBV-2 persists in T cells. We wereunable to detect EBV-2 in T-cell samples from mothers but could detect EBV-2 insamples of their breast milk and saliva.Conclusions: These data suggest that EBV-2 uses T cells as an additional latency reservoir but that, over time, the frequency of infected T cells may drop belowdetectable levels. Alternatively, EBV-2 may establish a prolonged transientinfection in the T-cell compartment. Collectively, these novel findingsdemonstrate that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo and suggest EBV-2 may use theT-cell compartment to establish latency.Â© The Author 2017.
