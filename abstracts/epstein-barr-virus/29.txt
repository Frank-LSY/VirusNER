In response to primary EBV infection, the host mountsan antiviral immune response comprising both innate and adaptive effectorfunctions. Although the immune system can control EBV infection to a largeextent, the virus is not cleared. Instead, EBV establishes a latent infection in B lymphocytes characterized by limited viral gene expression. For the production of new viral progeny, EBV reactivates from these latently infected cells. During the productive phase of infection, a repertoire of over 80 EBV gene products isexpressed, presenting a vast number of viral antigens to the primed immunesystem. In particular the EBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T lymphocytes canrespond within hours, potentially destroying the virus-producing cells beforeviral replication is completed and viral particles have been released. Preceding the adaptive immune response, potent innate immune mechanisms provide a firstline of defense during primary and recurrent infections. In spite of this broadrange of antiviral immune effector mechanisms, EBV persists for life andcontinues to replicate. Studies performed over the past decades have revealed awide array of viral gene products interfering with both innate and adaptiveimmunity. These include EBV-encoded proteins as well as small noncoding RNAs withimmune-evasive properties. The current review presents an overview of the evasionstrategies that are employed by EBV to facilitate immune escape during latencyand productive infection. These evasion mechanisms may also compromise theelimination of EBV-transformed cells, and thus contribute to malignanciesassociated with EBV infection.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22834-1_12 PMID: 26428381  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
