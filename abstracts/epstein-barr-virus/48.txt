Ourprevious work has demonstrated that years before diagnosis abnormal autoantibody responses are present in the sera of patients who will subsequently develop lupusand, further, that the initial targets of two of these key responses (anti-Sm B' and anti-60 kD Ro alone) have been identified for some patients. Indeed, ourresults suggest that the first lupus-specific autoantibodies arise fromparticular antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus Nuclear Antigen-1(EBNA-1) and that infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an environmentalrisk factor for lupus. The predicted sequence of events is normal immunity,followed by Epstein- Barr virus infection, the generation of anti-EBNA-1antibodies, then followed by those particular anti-EBNA-1 antibodies that alsobind lupus-specific autoantigens (Sm or Ro), followed by the development of more complex autoimmune responses, and, finally, culminating in clinical disease.Studies from others and those underway suggest that lupus patients have unusualimmune responses to Epstein-Barr virus. In aggregate, these results areconsistent with an immune response against Epstein-Barr virus being important in at least some patients for the initiation of lupus autoimmunity.PMID: 17121489  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
