Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a human γ-herpesvirus that was discovered in
Burkitt's lymphoma more than 50 years ago. Since then it has been proposed as the
causative agent of up to 2% of all tumors worldwide, mainly lymphomas and
epithelial cell carcinomas. Surprisingly, persistent EBV infection is at the same
time found in more than 90% of healthy human adults. Even the very same programs 
of EBV infection that are found in the associated malignancies are continuously
present in healthy EBV carriers. We will discuss primary immunodeficiencies and
immune compartment changes during the first decade of human life that give us
insights into how tumorigenesis by persistent EBV infection and Hodgkin's
lymphoma predisposing infectious mononucleosis is prevented during primary
infection. These insights should allow identifying individuals at risk to develop
EBV associated malignancies, who would benefit from EBV specific vaccination.
