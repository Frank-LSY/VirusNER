Epub 2016 Sep 1.Epstein Barr virus - a tumor virus that needs cytotoxic lymphocytes to persistasymptomatically.Münz C(1).Author information: (1)Viral Immunobiology, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University ofZürich, Switzerland. Electronic address: christian.muenz@uzh.ch.Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a human γ-herpesvirus that was discovered inBurkitt's lymphoma more than 50 years ago. Since then it has been proposed as thecausative agent of up to 2% of all tumors worldwide, mainly lymphomas andepithelial cell carcinomas. Surprisingly, persistent EBV infection is at the sametime found in more than 90% of healthy human adults. Even the very same programs of EBV infection that are found in the associated malignancies are continuouslypresent in healthy EBV carriers. We will discuss primary immunodeficiencies andimmune compartment changes during the first decade of human life that give usinsights into how tumorigenesis by persistent EBV infection and Hodgkin'slymphoma predisposing infectious mononucleosis is prevented during primaryinfection. These insights should allow identifying individuals at risk to developEBV associated malignancies, who would benefit from EBV specific vaccination.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
