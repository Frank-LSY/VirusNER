In the present study, 22 EBV whole-genome sequences from diseased andhealthy individuals were analysed to explore EBV sequence variations at thewhole-genome level. We found that the 22 EBV genomes were generally highlysimilar to each other at the genome level. However, varying degrees of geneticdiversity were detected across the entire genome, especially in the latent genes.In contrast, the sequences of promoters and non-coding RNAs were strictlyconserved. These findings suggested that both latent genes and non-coding RNAsplay important roles in the EBV life cycle. When we investigated changes in knownT-cell epitopes in some latent and lytic proteins, we observed that some T-cellepitopes were changed, while others were conserved. These findings indicate that the effect of EBV variations in protein sequences that seem to have been selectedby the host immune system should be considered when conducting EBV-targetedimmunotherapy. Taken together, our results provide a global view of EBV genomesequence variation, which not only is important for designing vaccines andimmunotherapy for EBV but also adds to the understanding of EBV biology and therelationships between viral sequence variation and EBV-associated diseases.DOI: 10.1099/jgv.0.000699 PMID: 28036243  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
