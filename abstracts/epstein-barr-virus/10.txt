The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that infects over 90 % of
adults. EBV is the primary etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is
closely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkin
lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Clinical serological assays for EBV diagnosis only
survey a small portion of the viral proteome, which does not represent the total 
antigenic breadth presented to the immune system during viral infection. In this 
study, we have generated an expression library containing the majority of EBV
ORFs, and have systematically evaluated IgG responses to those EBV proteins in
sera from EBV carriers. In addition to confirming previously recognized dominant 
EBV antigens, this study has identified additional immunodominant antigens, and
has revealed a more expansive antigenic profile of the humoral responses to EBV
in asymptomatic carriers. This EBV expression library will be deposited in a
public repository with the goal of disseminating this new research tool for the
application of identifying potential new biomarkers for EBV-associated diseases.
