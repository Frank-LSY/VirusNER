EBV is the primary etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and isclosely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkinlymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Clinical serological assays for EBV diagnosis onlysurvey a small portion of the viral proteome, which does not represent the total antigenic breadth presented to the immune system during viral infection. In this study, we have generated an expression library containing the majority of EBVORFs, and have systematically evaluated IgG responses to those EBV proteins insera from EBV carriers. In addition to confirming previously recognized dominant EBV antigens, this study has identified additional immunodominant antigens, andhas revealed a more expansive antigenic profile of the humoral responses to EBVin asymptomatic carriers. This EBV expression library will be deposited in apublic repository with the goal of disseminating this new research tool for theapplication of identifying potential new biomarkers for EBV-associated diseases.DOI: 10.1099/jgv.0.000891 PMID: 28795661  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
