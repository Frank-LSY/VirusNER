However, manycircumstances disturb the delicate EBV-host balance and cause the virus todisplay its pathogenic potential. Thus, primary infection in adolescence canmanifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM), as a fatal illness that magnifies the immunopathology of IM in boys with the X-linked lymphoproliferative diseasetrait, and as a chronic active disease leading to life-threateninghemophagocytosis in rare cases of T or natural killer (NK) cell infection.Patients with primary immunodeficiencies affecting the NK and/or T cell systems, as well as immunosuppressed transplant recipients, handle EBV infections poorly, and many are at increased risk of virus-driven B-lymphoproliferative disease. By contrast, a range of other EBV-positive malignancies of lymphoid or epithelialorigin arise in individuals with seemingly intact immune systems throughmechanisms that remain to be understood.DOI: 10.1146/annurev-immunol-032414-112326 PMID: 25706097  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
