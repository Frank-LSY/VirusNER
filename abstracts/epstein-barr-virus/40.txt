Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is usually acquired silently early in life and carried
thereafter as an asymptomatic infection of the B lymphoid system. However, many
circumstances disturb the delicate EBV-host balance and cause the virus to
display its pathogenic potential. Thus, primary infection in adolescence can
manifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM), as a fatal illness that magnifies the 
immunopathology of IM in boys with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
trait, and as a chronic active disease leading to life-threatening
hemophagocytosis in rare cases of T or natural killer (NK) cell infection.
Patients with primary immunodeficiencies affecting the NK and/or T cell systems, 
as well as immunosuppressed transplant recipients, handle EBV infections poorly, 
and many are at increased risk of virus-driven B-lymphoproliferative disease. By 
contrast, a range of other EBV-positive malignancies of lymphoid or epithelial
origin arise in individuals with seemingly intact immune systems through
mechanisms that remain to be understood.
