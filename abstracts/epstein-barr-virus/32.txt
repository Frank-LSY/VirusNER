A.I.BELL@bham.ac.uk.The morphology of the pathognomonic Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS) ofHodgkin lymphoma was described over a century ago, yet it was only relativelyrecently that the B-cell origin of these cells was identified. In a proportion ofcases, HRS cells harbour monoclonal forms of the B lymphotropic Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV). This review summarises current knowledge of the pathogenesis ofHodgkin lymphoma with a particular emphasis on the contribution of EBV.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22822-8_12 PMID: 26424651  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
