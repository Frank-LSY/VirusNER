Since the initial report of unusual manifestations possibly associated with
chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (CAEBV), nearly three decades
have passed. During this period, reported cases with this entity have
dramatically increased in the world. Additionally, recent development of
diagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunological
techniques, have provided us with the ability to define certain diseases,
especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the current
literature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV are
proposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.
