During this period, reported cases with this entity havedramatically increased in the world. Additionally, recent development ofdiagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunologicaltechniques, have provided us with the ability to define certain diseases,especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the currentliterature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV areproposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/ajh.20398 PMID: 16138335  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
