Electronic address:rscott1@lsuhsc.edu.Like all herpesviruses, the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establishlife-long persistent infections is related to a biphasic viral lifecycle thatinvolves latency and reactivation/lytic replication. Memory B cells serve as the EBV latency compartment where silencing of viral gene expression allowsmaintenance of the viral genome, avoidance of immune surveillance, and life-long carriage. Upon viral reactivation, viral gene expression is induced forreplication, progeny virion production, and viral spread. EBV uses the hostepigenetic machinery to regulate its distinct viral gene expression states.However, epigenetic manipulation by EBV affects the host epigenome byreprogramming cells in ways that leave long-lasting, oncogenic phenotypes. Suchvirally-induced epigenetic alterations are evident in EBV-associated cancers.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.
