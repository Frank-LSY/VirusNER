Like all herpesviruses, the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish
life-long persistent infections is related to a biphasic viral lifecycle that
involves latency and reactivation/lytic replication. Memory B cells serve as the 
EBV latency compartment where silencing of viral gene expression allows
maintenance of the viral genome, avoidance of immune surveillance, and life-long 
carriage. Upon viral reactivation, viral gene expression is induced for
replication, progeny virion production, and viral spread. EBV uses the host
epigenetic machinery to regulate its distinct viral gene expression states.
However, epigenetic manipulation by EBV affects the host epigenome by
reprogramming cells in ways that leave long-lasting, oncogenic phenotypes. Such
virally-induced epigenetic alterations are evident in EBV-associated cancers.
