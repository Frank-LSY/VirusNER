According to thegerminal center model (GCM), latently infected B cells transit the germinalcenter (GC) to become resting memory cells. Here, the virus resides quiescently, occasionally reactivating to infect new B cells, completing the cycle ofinfection. The GCM remains the only model that explains EBV biology and thepathogenesis of lymphoma. Recent work suggests modifications to the model notablythat the virus contributes only modestly to the GC process and predictions frommathematical models that quiescence within memory B cells shapes the overallstructure of viral infection but is not essential for persistence. Rather, it is the cycle of infection which allows viral persistence at the very low levelsobserved.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
