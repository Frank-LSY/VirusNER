Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) maintains a lifelong infection. According to the
germinal center model (GCM), latently infected B cells transit the germinal
center (GC) to become resting memory cells. Here, the virus resides quiescently, 
occasionally reactivating to infect new B cells, completing the cycle of
infection. The GCM remains the only model that explains EBV biology and the
pathogenesis of lymphoma. Recent work suggests modifications to the model notably
that the virus contributes only modestly to the GC process and predictions from
mathematical models that quiescence within memory B cells shapes the overall
structure of viral infection but is not essential for persistence. Rather, it is 
the cycle of infection which allows viral persistence at the very low levels
observed.
