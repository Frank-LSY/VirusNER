The restricted geographic prevalence of NPC along with the tumor's consistent association with EBV infection has fascinated scientists andclinicians ever since it was first suggested in 1966. As in all cancers, NPCdevelopment reflects the complex interplay between host genes and environmentalfactors, but the essential role of EBV infection provides important insight into the etiology of this tumor. Indeed, it is this understanding that is nowtranslating into exciting diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.DOI: 10.5732/cjc.014.10208 PMCID: PMC4244314PMID: 25367333  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
