The special November and December issues of the Chinese Journal of Cancer
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with 
a series of reviews covering the association of the virus with various cancers,
with special emphasis on the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal
cancer (NPC). The restricted geographic prevalence of NPC along with the tumor's 
consistent association with EBV infection has fascinated scientists and
clinicians ever since it was first suggested in 1966. As in all cancers, NPC
development reflects the complex interplay between host genes and environmental
factors, but the essential role of EBV infection provides important insight into 
the etiology of this tumor. Indeed, it is this understanding that is now
translating into exciting diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.
