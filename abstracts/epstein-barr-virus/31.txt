Epstein-Barr virus infection ispredominantly latent; however, lytic infection is detected in healthyseropositive individuals and becomes more prominent in certain pathologicalconditions. Lytic infection is divided into several stages: early geneexpression, DNA replication, late gene expression, assembly, and egress. Thischapter summarizes the most recent progress made toward understanding themolecular mechanisms that regulate the different lytic stages leading toproduction of viral progeny. In addition, the chapter highlights the potentialrole of lytic infection in disease development and current attempts to purposely induce lytic infection as a therapeutic approach.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-22834-1_8 PMID: 26428377  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
