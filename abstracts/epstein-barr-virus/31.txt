Epstein-Barr virus, which mainly infects B cells and epithelial cells, has two
modes of infection: latent and lytic. Epstein-Barr virus infection is
predominantly latent; however, lytic infection is detected in healthy
seropositive individuals and becomes more prominent in certain pathological
conditions. Lytic infection is divided into several stages: early gene
expression, DNA replication, late gene expression, assembly, and egress. This
chapter summarizes the most recent progress made toward understanding the
molecular mechanisms that regulate the different lytic stages leading to
production of viral progeny. In addition, the chapter highlights the potential
role of lytic infection in disease development and current attempts to purposely 
induce lytic infection as a therapeutic approach.
