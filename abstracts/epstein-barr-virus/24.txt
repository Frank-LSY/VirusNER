Epub 2016 Dec 5.Epstein-Barr virus strains and variations: Geographic or disease-specificvariants?Neves M(1)(2), Marinho-Dias J(1)(3)(4), Ribeiro J(1)(2)(3), Sousa H(1)(3).Author information: (1)Molecular Oncology and Viral Pathology Group, Research Centre (CI-IPOP),Porto, Portugal.(2)Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto (FMUP), Porto, Portugal.(3)Virology Service, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal.(4)Abel Salazar Institute for the Biomedical Sciences of University of Porto(ICBAS-UP), Porto, Portugal.The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is associated with the development of severaldiseases, including infectious mononucleosis (IM), Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL),Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, and other neoplasias. The publication of EBV genome1984 led to several studies regarding the identification of different viralstrains. Currently, EBV is divided into EBV type 1 (B95-8 strain) and EBV type 2 (AG876 strain), also known as type A and type B, which have been distinguishedbased upon genetic differences in the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens (EBNAs)sequence. Several other EBV strains have been described in the past 10 yearsconsidering variations on EBV genome, and many have attempted to clarify if thesevariations are ethnic or geographically correlated, or if they are diseaserelated. Indeed, there is an increasing interest to describe possible specificdisease associations, with emphasis on different malignancies. These studies aim to clarify if these variations are ethnic or geographically correlated, or ifthey are disease related, thus being important to characterize the epidemiologic genetic distribution of EBV strains on our population. Here, we review thecurrent knowledge on the different EBV strains and variants and its associationwith different diseases. J. Med.
