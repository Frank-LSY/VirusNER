BACKGROUND: Latent membrane protein (LMP) 1 and LMP2A encoded by Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) are associated with the development of malignancies, but their
expression in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) and the
relationship with clinical characteristics of this disease remain poorly
understood. In the present study, we examined the expression of LMP1 and LMP2A in
ENKTL, and investigated the correlations between LMP1 and LMP2A expression with
clinicopathological characteristics of ENKTL patients.
METHODS: Paraffin sections of surgically removed samples from 16 ENKTL patients
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the related clinicopathological data
were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Elevated expression (immunohistochemistry score â‰¥ 4) of LMP1 and LMP2A
was detected in the tumor cells of ENKTL. High LMP1 expression was associated
with positive B symptoms (p = 0.012), while high LMP2A expression was related to 
gender (p = 0.029). The expression of both LMP1 and LMP2A showed significant
correlations with patients' overall survival (p = 0.049, p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: LMP1 and LMP2A may be prognostic indicators of survival in patients
with ENKTL.
