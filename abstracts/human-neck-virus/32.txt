Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Tobacco
smoking and alcohol consumption are two well known behavioral risk factors
associated with head and neck cancer. Recently, evidence is mounting that
infection with human papilloma virus, most commonly human papilloma virus-16 is
responsible for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma especially
tumors of tonsillar origin. The molecular pathway used by human papilloma virus
to trigger malignant transformation of tissue is different from that of other
well known risk factors, i.e. smoking and alcohol, associated with squamous cell 
carcinoma. Apparently, these subsets of patients with human papilloma virus
positive tumor are more likely to have a better prognosis than human papilloma
virus negative tumor. Considering this fact, the human papilloma virus infection 
should be determined in all oropharyngeal cancers since it can have a major
impact on the decision making process of the treatment.
