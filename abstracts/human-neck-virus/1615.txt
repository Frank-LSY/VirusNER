OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma is increasing in incidence and appears to exhibit improved response to 
treatment and better survival than that of HPV- head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the current
literature regarding treatment and prognosis of HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC) and identify whether type of treatment (primarily surgery vs
primarily radiation) significantly affects survival rates.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Cochrane Library databases.
REVIEW METHODS: A computerized search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library
databases was performed to identify English-language articles published between
January 1, 2000, and October 21, 2014. Studies were included only if they were
prospective or retrospective observational series of OPSCC patients that reported
HPV status, treatment regimen, and survival outcomes. Outcomes were determined
for HPV+ and HPV- OPSCC patients, with subanalyses according to the type of
treatment received.
RESULTS: Fifty-six articles were eligible for this review. In the HPV+ analysis, 
the unadjusted hazard rate ratio (HR) for surgery vs radiation treatment was 1.33
(P = .114). Nine confounders were considered, and HRs were adjusted for each
covariate. While HRs were almost all >1 for all covariates, none of the HRs was
statistically significant at P < .05. The HR for HPV- OPSCC was higher for
radiation than surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV+ OPSCC has an improved prognosis and lower rates of adverse
events when compared with HPV- OPSCC. HPV- OPSCC had significantly worse outcomes
when treated with primary radiation as compared with primary surgery. There was
no statistically significant difference in HRs for HPV+ OPSCC with primary
radiation vs primary surgery treatment.
