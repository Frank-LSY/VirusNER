This study is a retrospective analysis of clinico-pathological data to
investigate survival rates of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) treated with different modalities in a single academic head and neck
cancer center in different time intervals. Altogether, 287 patients with OPSCC
were included in this comparison. Patients were analysed during two different
treatment periods: Group 1 included patients treated mainly with primary
surgery ± adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy between 2002 and 2007, while Group 2
included patients treated with organ/function-preservation protocols if
indicated. Main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free
survival (RFS). Between 2002 and 2007, early-stage OPSCC showed a 5-year OS of
75% compared to that of 86% between 2008 and 2013. Locally advanced OPSCC showed 
a 5-year OS of 66% between 2002 and 2007 compared to that of 74% between 2008 and
2013. RFS in early-stage OPSCC was 48% between 2002 and 2007 in contrast to that 
of 77% between 2008 and 2013. With locally advanced OPSCC, RFS was 55% between
2002 and 2007 compared to that of 56% between 2008 and 2013. These differences
were statistically not significant. The OS and RFS remained generally unchanged
over the analysed time period. There was no significant difference in the
outcomes with regards to HPV status and to their treatment modality.
