The number of reports describing malignant tumors arising in flaps has been
increasing recently. This report describes the case of a patient who had a second
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the center of the skin island of a forearm flap 
raised approximately 6 years previously. Histopathologic examination suggested
human papillomavirus infection and "mucosalization" of the flap. In addition, the
authors review previous cases, with special attention to etiologic factors and
surgical strategies. There might be a causal relation between second primary SCC 
in the flap and the carcinogenic effect (chronic inflammation) induced by the
environment surrounding the squamous epithelium of the flap. If environmental
factors have greatly contributed to the occurrence of a tumor, there is a
potential for tumor occurrence in the remaining flap. There also might be a
potential for generating second primary SCC in these foci. The results suggested 
that total resection of the flap might be recommended in the surgical resection
of second primary SCC arising in a flap.
