Since the publication of Intergroup Study 0099, representing a superiority of
concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin followed by adjuvant chemotherapy to 
radiotherapy alone for the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, an efficacy of concurrent setting of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with
radiotherapy has been repeatedly validated. In meanwhile, the role of adjuvant
part of the protocol has been controversial. There is an increasing evidence for 
the positive role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with following concurrent
chemoradiotherapy whereas favorable contribution was not proven in the last
century. This article reviews the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of
locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
