BACKGROUND: There are few data regarding the role of human papilloma virus (HPV) 
in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out using our
electronic medical record (EPIC) for all patients diagnosed with HPV-positive R/M
HNSCC between 2010 and 2014 with minimum of 6 months of follow-up in order to
assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: We assessed 11 patients who underwent a variety of treatments. PFS and
OS were 7 and 34+ months, respectively. Four patients (36%) were still alive and 
disease-free (median OS of 39+ months). Three disease-free patients had been
treated with taxane, platinum and 5-fluorouracil as aggressive curative systemic 
therapy. Another patient treated with TPF was disease-free for 25 months and died
of disease at 42 months.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates favorable prognosis for patients with
HPV-positive R/M HNSCC and that aggressive systemic treatment can lead to a
prolonged disease-free period or possibly cure, even after metastasis.
