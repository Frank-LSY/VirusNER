The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery
functions in HIV-1 budding, cytokinesis, multivesicular body biogenesis, and
other pathways, in the course of which it interacts with concave membrane necks
and bud rims. To test the role of membrane shape in regulating ESCRT assembly, we
nanofabricated templates for invaginated supported lipid bilayers. The assembly
of the core ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4B/Snf7 is preferentially nucleated in the
resulting 100-nm-deep membrane concavities. ESCRT-II and CHMP6 accelerate CHMP4B 
assembly by increasing the concentration of nucleation seeds. Superresolution
imaging was used to visualize CHMP4B/Snf7 concentration in a negatively curved
annulus at the rim of the invagination. Although Snf7 assemblies nucleate slowly 
on flat membranes, outward growth onto the flat membrane is efficiently nucleated
at invaginations. The nucleation behavior provides a biophysical explanation for 
the timing of ESCRT-III recruitment and membrane scission in HIV-1 budding.
