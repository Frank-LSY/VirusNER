BACKGROUND: Porphyria is a condition of cutaneous photosensitivity. It is unclear
if radiotherapy (RT) is safe in patients with porphyria.
METHODS: We report a patient case with uncontrolled porphyria cutanea tarda
treated with chemoradiation for p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Given the
scarcity of data on this subject, we also conducted a literature review on the
topic of radiation in patients with porphyria.
RESULTS: The patient in our study did not experience any unusual acute or late
toxicity, despite receiving a high dose of cutaneous radiation. We also found the
majority of the literature supports the safe use of therapeutic radiation in
patients with porphyria.
CONCLUSION: In this patient, and in the majority of the literature, radiation
seems safe in patients with porphyria; however, there are few reports on the
subject in the literature, therefore, caution is warranted.
