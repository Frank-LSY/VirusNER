The purpose of this study was to examine treatment outcomes and define factors
that influence survival in patients with pN2 oropharyngeal carcinoma. Fifty-five 
patients underwent primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy between 1994
and 2009. Primary tumor sites were 36 tonsil, 13 base of tongue, 3 soft palate,
and three posterior pharyngeal wall. There were 15, 26, 5, and 9 patients with
stage T1 to T4 cancers, respectively. The N stage were 5 N2a, 37 N2b, and 13 N2c.
The 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 66%. A significant positive
correlation was found between high risk HPV status and extracapsular spread and
disease-specific survival rates (HPV (+); 93% vs. HPV (-); 56%, p=0.031 and
extracapsular spread (-); 93% vs. extracapsular spread (+); 50%, p=0.008,
respectively). Primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy can be achieved
with favorable oncologic outcomes for pN2 oropharyngeal carcinoma. Factors that
affected prognosis were HPV status and extracapsular spread.
