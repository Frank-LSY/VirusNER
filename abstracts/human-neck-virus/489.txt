Cryptococcosis is a life threatening, opportunistic fungal disease in human
immunodeficiency virus-infected individual. Lymph node involvement as a
presenting feature in Cryptococcosis is not a common manifestation. A prompt
diagnosis is of utmost importance in this disseminated form of cryptococcosis.
There are very few reports, however, of cryptococcal lymphadenitis as a
presenting feature. We report here a case of cryptococcal lymphadenitis that was 
diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology of the involved cervical lymph node.
