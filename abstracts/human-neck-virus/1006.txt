BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported a therapeutic strategy comprising 
replication-defective NIS-expressing adenovirus combined with radioiodide,
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and DNA repair inhibition. We have now
evaluated NIS-expressing oncolytic measles virus (MV-NIS) combined with
NIS-guided radioiodide, EBRT and specific checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibition
in head and neck and colorectal models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-proliferative/cytotoxic effects of individual agents 
and their combinations were measured by MTS, clonogenic and Western analysis.
Viral gene expression was measured by radioisotope uptake and replication by
one-step growth curves. Potential synergistic interactions were tested in vitro
by Bliss independence analysis and in in vivo therapeutic studies.
RESULTS: EBRT and MV-NIS were synergistic in vitro. Furthermore, EBRT increased
NIS expression in infected cells. SAR-020106 was synergistic with EBRT, but also 
with MV-NIS in HN5 cells. MV-NIS mediated (131)I-induced cytotoxicity in HN5 and 
HCT116 cells and, in the latter, this was enhanced by SAR-020106. In vivo studies
confirmed that MV-NIS, EBRT and Chk1 inhibition were effective in HCT116
xenografts. The quadruplet regimen of MV-NIS, virally-directed (131)I, EBRT and
SAR-020106 had significant anti-tumour activity in HCT116 xenografts.
CONCLUSION: This study strongly supports translational and clinical research on
MV-NIS combined with radiation therapy and radiosensitising agents.
