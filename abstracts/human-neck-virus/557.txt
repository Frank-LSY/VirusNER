INTRODUCTION: Locally advanced head and neck cancer carries a poor prognosis,
even with standard combination (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) treatment
regimens. There is a pressing need for novel therapies with activity against this
tumour type. Oncolytic reovirus type 3 (Dearing) is preferentially cytotoxic in
tumour cells with an activated Ras signalling pathway and represents a promising 
novel therapy with relevance in head and neck cancer.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss the pre-clinical and clinical data that
have underpinned the translational development of oncolytic reovirus thus far. In
particular, we describe the iterative nature of the research programme through
initial studies testing single-agent reovirus therapy and on to subsequent work
in which reovirus has been combined with either radiotherapy or cytotoxic
chemotherapy. We will trace the process by which oncolytic reovirus has reached
Phase III evaluation in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with 
platin-refractory, relapsed/metastatic head and neck cancer.
EXPERT OPINION: Reovirus is a self-amplifying, cancer-selective agent that offers
huge potential advantages over standard chemotherapy, targeted small molecules or
monoclonal antibodies. However, it is most likely that reovirus will show
efficacy and be approved in combination with standard modalities (cytotoxic
chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or other targeted agents, especially those that
modulate signal transduction pathways. The next 5 years are critical for the
development of oncolytic reovirus as an anti-cancer therapy and hinge on the
ongoing Phase III trial in head and neck cancer and other Phase II programmes.
