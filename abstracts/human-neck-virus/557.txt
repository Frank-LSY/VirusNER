OBP-301 is a type 5 adenovirus that contains the replication cassette in which the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter drives expression of the E1 genes. OBP-401 contained the replication cassette and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The antitumor effects of OBP-301 were evaluated in vitro by the sodium 30-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate assay and in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft model. Virus spread into the lymphatics was also orthotopically assessed by using OBP-401.
