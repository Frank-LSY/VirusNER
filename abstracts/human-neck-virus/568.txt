Potential of G-rich sequences as drug targets was evaluated based on the results of the current study. HPV16 and HPV18 are considered less appropriate targets due to several single nucleotide polymorphisms and low stability, respectively. On the other hand, HPV52 and HPV58 could be used for small-molecule mediated stabilization.
