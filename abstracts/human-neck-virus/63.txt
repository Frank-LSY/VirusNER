BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the presence and frequency of
human papillomavirus (HPV) nucleic acid in p16-positive oral squamous cell
carcinomas (OSCCs), to assess whether the virus was transcriptionally active and 
to assess the utility of p16 overexpression as a surrogate marker for HPV in
OSCC.
METHODS: Forty-six OSCC patients treated between 2007 and 2011 with available
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were included. Twenty-three
patients were positive for p16 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and these were
matched with 23 patients with p16-negative tumours. Laser capture microdissection
of the FFPE OSCC tissues was undertaken to isolate invasive tumour tissue. DNA
was extracted and tested for high-risk HPV types using a PCR-ELISA method based
on the L1 SPF10 consensus primers, and a real-time PCR method targeting HPV-16
and HPV-18 E6 region. Genotyping of HPV-positive cases was performed using a
reverse line blot hybridization assay (Inno-LiPA). RNAScope® (a chromogenic RNA
in situ hybridization assay) was utilized to detect E6/E7 mRNA of known high-risk
HPV types for detection of transcriptionally active virus.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was found in 3 OSCC cases, all of which were p16 IHC-positive.
Two cases were genotyped as HPV-16 and one as HPV-33. Only one of the HPV-16
cases was confirmed to harbour transcriptionally active virus via HPV RNA ISH.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that the presence of transcriptionally active HPV
rarely occurs in OSCC and that p16 is not an appropriate surrogate marker for HPV
in OSCC cases. We propose that non-viral mechanisms are responsible for the
majority of IHC p16 overexpression in OSCC.
