Cervical traction is a frequently used treatment in rehabilitation clinics for
cervical spine problems. This modality works, in principle, by decompressing the 
spinal cord or its nerve roots by applying traction on the cervical spine through
a harness placed over the mandible (Olivero et al., Neurosurg Focus
2002;12:ECP1). Previous reports on treatment complications include lumbar
radicular discomfort, muscle injury, neck soreness, and posttraction pain (LaBan 
et al., Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1992;73:295-6; Lee et al., J Biomech Eng
1996;118:597-600). Here, we report the first case of unilateral facial nerve
paralysis developed after 4 wks of intermittent cervical traction therapy. Nerve 
conduction velocity examination revealed a peripheral-type facial nerve
paralysis. Symptoms of facial nerve paralysis subsided after prednisolone
treatment and suspension of traction therapy. It is suspected that a misplaced or
an overstrained harness may have been the cause of facial nerve paralysis in this
patient. Possible causes were (1) direct compression by the harness on the right 
facial nerve near its exit through the stylomastoid foramen; (2) compression of
the right external carotid artery by the harness, causing transient ischemic
injury at the geniculate ganglion; or (3) coincidental herpes zoster virus
infection or idiopathic Bell's palsy involving the facial nerve.
