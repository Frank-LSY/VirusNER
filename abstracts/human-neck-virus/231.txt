These 2013 ORL news have been established by compulsing more than 10000 abstracts
published during this year. It is always difficult to be restrictive, but we
limited this year the selection to several topics: The HPV positive oropharyngeal
cancers, tonsillectomies versus tonsillotomies, and benefits of honey. These
different themes will be treated on the mode question-answers.
