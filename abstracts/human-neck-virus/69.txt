Much of the current literature regarding the molecular pathophysiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has focused on the virus's effect on cell cycle modulation and cell proliferation. A second mechanism of pathogenicity employed by HPV, dysregulation of cellular DNA repair processes, has been more sparsely studied. The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding about the effect of HPV on DNA repair in HNSCC, taking cues from cervical cancer literature. HPV affects DNA-damage response pathways by interacting with many proteins, including ATM, ATR, MRN, Î³-H2AX, Chk1, Chk2, p53, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, Rb-related proteins 107 and 130, Tip60, and p16INK4A. Further elucidation of these pathways could lead to development of targeted therapies and improvement of current treatment protocols.
