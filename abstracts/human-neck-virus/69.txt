BACKGROUND: Increases in incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) in countries with falling tobacco use have been attributed to a growing
role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the carcinogenesis. Trends of HPV
prevalence in populations with persistently high portions of smokers are poorly
characterised.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Registry data from East Germany were used to determine
incidence trends between 1998 and 2011. Data from patients treated at the Charité
University Medicine Berlin between 2004 and 2013 (cohort 1, N=436) were used for 
estimation of trends in HPV prevalence, smoking and survival. HPV prevalence was 
prospectively confirmed in cohort 2 (N=213) comprising all primary HNSCC cases at
the Charité in 2013.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2011 incidence of both OPSCC and non-OPSCC increased.
An increase in HPV prevalence (% of HPV+ cases in 2004-2006 versus 2012-2013: 27%
versus 59%, P=0.0004) accompanied by a moderate decrease in the portion of
current smokers was observed in OPSCC but not in non-OPSCC. The change in disease
epidemiology in OPSCC was associated with significant improvement in overall
survival. Increased HPV prevalence in OPSCC (48%) compared to non-OPSCC (11%) was
confirmed in cohort 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite clear differences to the United States in terms of tobacco
use, the increase in OPSCC incidence in a European population was also mainly
attributed to HPV, and the HPV status significantly affected prognosis. For
clinical trial design it is important to consider the large group of smokers
within HPV-induced OPSCC.
