Chromosomal alterations detected in HNSCCs were characterized by metaphase comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and correlated with clinical parameters as well as survival time. Candidate regions were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH) on dapped tumor tissue and liquid-based cytological smear preparations. In addition, HPV status was determined by polymerase chain reaction and simultaneous immunocytochemical p16
