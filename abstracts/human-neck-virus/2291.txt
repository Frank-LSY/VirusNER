BACKGROUND: Currently, most cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) are treated by chemoradiotherapy. However, serious concerns have arisen
regarding toxicity and poor functional outcomes. Recently, transoral techniques
for resection of selected OPSCC have been developed.
AIMS: To review the outcomes of transoral surgery for OPSCC at our institution.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 12 patients with OPSCC treated with transoral
resection. Data on surgical complications, oncological outcomes, and functional
outcomes were analysed.
RESULTS: Primary sites were tonsil (9), soft palate (1), base of tongue (1), and 
posterior pharyngeal wall (1). There were no surgical complications. After the
mean follow-up of 19Â months, there were no local or regional recurrences. Two
patients (one with synchronous lung cancer) died from distant metastases. No
patient required gastrostomy tube or had long-term speech or swallowing
impairments.
CONCLUSION: Transoral resection is an excellent option for selected patients with
OPSCC, offering excellent functional and oncological outcomes.
