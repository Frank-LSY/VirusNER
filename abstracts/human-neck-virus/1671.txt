BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causally associated with ano-genital
and a subset of head and neck cancers. Rising incidence of HPV+ anal cancers and 
head and neck cancers have now been demonstrated in the developed world over the 
last decade. The majority of published data on HPV prevalence at the anal and
oro-pharyngeal sites are from studies of higher-risk populations. There is a
paucity of data on the prevalence of HPV at non-cervical sites in lower risk,
non-HIV+ women and this study was designed to provide initial pilot data on a
population of women recalled for colposcopy as part of the UK cervical screening 
programme.
METHODS: 100 non-HIV+ women with abnormal cervical cytology, attending clinic for
colposcopic examination were recruited. Swabs from the oro-pharyngeal, anal and
cervical sites were taken and DNA extracted. HPV detection and genotyping were
performed using a standardised, commercially available PCR-line blot assay, which
is used to genotype 37 HPV subtypes known to infect the ano-genital and
oro-pharyngeal areas. Strict sampling and laboratory precautions were taken to
prevent cross-contamination.
RESULTS: There was a very high prevalence of HPV infection at all three sites:
96.0%, 91.4% and 92.4% at the cervix, anus and oro-pharynx, respectively.
Multiple HPV subtype infections were dominant at all 3 mucosal sites. At least
one or more HR genotype was present at both the cervix/anus in 39/52 (75.0%)
patients; both the cervix/oro-pharynx in 48/56 (85.7%) patients; and both the
anus/oro-pharynx in 39/52 (75.0%) patients. HPV 16 infection was highly dominant 
across all mucosal sites, with over a 2-fold increase over the next most
prevalent subtype (HPV 31).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with abnormal smears have widespread infection with high-risk 
HPV at the cervical, anal and oro-pharyngeal mucosal sites and may represent a
higher risk population for HPV disease in the future.
