INTRODUCTION: The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is
increasing, but data on the incidence of synchronous, bilateral tonsillar
squamous cell carcinomas (BiTSCCs) is sparse. In this study, we report the
incidence and tumour characteristics of BiTSCCs in a population-based,
consecutive cohort of OPSCCs.
METHODS: We identified all patients diagnosed with tonsillar squamous cell
carcinoma (TSCC) in eastern Denmark during a 15-year period to detect the
incidence of synchronous BiTSCCs. The tumours were assessed for p16Ink4a
expression, the presence of HPV DNA and HPV genotypes. Furthermore, we
systematically reviewed the literature examining BiTSCCs.
RESULTS: Of the total of 1119 TSCCs diagnosed in eastern Denmark from 2000 to
2014, we identified 12 BiTSCCs, nine of which initially presented as a cancer of 
unknown primary (CUP) in the neck. Nine cases were bilaterally HPV16 positive
(HPV16+), while two cases were HPV16+ in one tonsil and respectively, HPV33 and
HPV35 positive in the contralateral tonsil. One case was bilaterally
HPV-negative. We also identified an increase in the incidence of BiTSCCs after
2012 when histological examination of the entire tonsil tissue became routine,
suggesting that BiTSCCs might be underdiagnosed. In the literature, we identified
15 studies from six countries, encompassing 25 cases in total.
CONCLUSIONS: BiTSCCs were primarily HPV16+ and were most often diagnosed as part 
of the diagnostic work-up for CUP. We found an incidence of 9% BiTSCCs in
patients with TSCC after 2012 and we therefore recommend focusing on putative
BiTSCC with total embedding and histological examination of tonsils harvested by 
bilateral tonsillectomies.
