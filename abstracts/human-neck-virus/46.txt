In addition to traditional risk factors such as smoking habits and alcohol
consumption, certain microbes also play an important role in the generation of
head and neck carcinomas. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types is 
strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and
Epstein-Barr virus appears to be indispensable for the development of
non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Other viruses
including torque teno virus and hepatitis C virus may act as co-carcinogens,
increasing the risk of malignant transformation. A shift in the composition of
the oral microbiome was associated with the development of oral squamous cell
carcinoma, although the causal or casual role of oral bacteria remains to be
clarified. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a mutagenic compound, by
members of the oral microflora as well as by fungi including Candida albicans and
others is a potential mechanism that may increase oral cancer risk. In addition, 
distinct Candida spp. also produce NBMA (N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine), a potent
carcinogen. Inflammatory processes elicited by microbes may also facilitate
tumorigenesis in the head and neck region.
