OBJECTIVES: Published cases of oral high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HGNEC)
variably call the tumors Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) or small-cell/high-grade
neuroendocrine carcinoma. We studied cases of cutaneous MCC and mucosal HGNEC to 
better distinguish them and to better define oral cases.
STUDY DESIGN: Twelve cutaneous MCC and 14 mucosal HGNEC cases were identified. We
reviewed the hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) morphology and performed
immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor 1
(TTF-1), p63, neurofilament (NF), and achaete-scute homolog 1 (MASH-1). We also
performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the Merkel cell polyomavirus
(MCPyV).
RESULTS: By morphology and immunohistochemistry, MCC and HGNEC showed many
differences. CK20, NF, and TTF-1 stains were the most discriminatory. MASH-1 was 
expressed by both MCC and HGNEC. MCPyV was present in MCC and absent in all
HGNEC. The 2 oral cavity mucosal carcinomas segregated into MCC and HGNEC types, 
the former having the H&E nuclear morphology and classic dot-like perinuclear
CK20 staining typically associated with MCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral cavity neuroendocrine carcinoma can be segregated into MCC and 
small-cell/HGNEC types by morphology and CK20 immunohistochemistry. MCPyV was
present by PCR in cutaneous MCC but was not found in mucosal HGNEC.
