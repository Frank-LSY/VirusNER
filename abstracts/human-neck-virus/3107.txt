BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for a sizable
proportion of chronic liver disease cases and represents the most common
indication for liver transplantation. Precise diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis stage
is considered a funnel-neck in proper management and follow-up of HCV-infected
patients. Given the possible complications of liver biopsy, a non-invasive method
for assessing hepatic fibrosis is needed. This study aimed to evaluate the
diagnostic accuracy of APRI and hyaluronic acid as non-invasive diagnostic
assessment tools for post HCV liver fibrosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Systematic literature searching identified studies
performed on Egyptian territory to evaluate APRI and hyaluronic acid as
non-invasive tests of fibrosis and using liver biopsy as the reference standard. 
Meta-analysis was performed for areas with an adequate number of publications.
Validation of meta- analysis on APRI was done on a subset of 150 treatment-naïve 
post-hepatitis C patients.
RESULTS: Both APRI and hyaluronic acid have superior predictive power for hepatic
cirrhosis (F4) than for significant fibrosis (F2-F3). The pooled estimate for
sensitivities and specificities of APRI and hyaluronic acid to diagnose F4 were
(84% and 82%) and (83% and 89%) respectively. In the subgroup of treatment naïve 
post-hepatitis C patients, APRI had higher diagnostic performance to diagnose
liver cirrhosis with 93.8% sensitivity and 72.4% specificity (AUC; 0.908, 95%CI; 
0.851-0.965, p-value; <0.001) compared to its accuracy to diagnose significant
hepatic fibrosis with 65.1% sensitivity and 77.8% (AUC; 0.685, 95% CI; 0.59-0.78,
p-value; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: APRI score and hyaluronic acid levels are simple and reliable
non-invasive markers to detect advanced fibrosis among post-hepatitis C patients.
