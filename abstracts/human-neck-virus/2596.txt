CONTEXT: Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract is a
heterogenous entity. Although conventional squamous cell carcinomas are easily
recognized, the morphologic variants of squamous cell carcinoma can present a
diagnostic challenge. Familiarity with these variants is necessary because many
are associated with unique risk factors and are characterized by specific
molecular alterations (eg, nuclear protein in testis midline carcinomas). Perhaps
the most important distinction is in identifying viral-related from
nonviral-related carcinomas. The accurate diagnosis of these variants is
necessary for prognostic and therapeutic reasons.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a clinicopathologic overview and summary of the molecular 
alterations of the common squamous cell carcinoma variants, including verrucous, 
spindle cell, acantholytic, adenosquamous, basaloid, and papillary squamous cell 
carcinoma, as well as nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma, and to discuss
the distinguishing features of human papillomavirus- and Epstein-Barr
virus-related squamous cell carcinomas.
DATA SOURCES: Published peer-reviewed literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with squamous cell carcinoma variants is essential for
proper diagnosis and to guide appropriate clinical management. Further insight
into the molecular alterations underlying those variants may lead to alterations 
in existing treatment approaches and to evolution of novel treatment modalities.
