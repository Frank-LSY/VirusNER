BACKGROUND: Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is an uncommon variant of lichen
planus, for which no effective treatment is available. Objectives The aim of this
study was to determine the clinical, epidemiological and histopathological
characteristics of LPP patients in Kuwait.
METHODS: Thirty-three LPP patients who attended the Dermatology outpatient
clinics at Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait from the year 2002 to 2008 were studied for
clinical, epidemiological and histopathological findings. Thirteen of these
patients were treated with topical tacrolimus 0.03%. Ointment applied topically
twice daily for the duration varying from 6 to 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the 33 patients, 21 were men and 12 were women. The duration of
eruption ranged from 6 weeks to 3 years. The face and neck were the commonest
sites, affecting 18 (54.5%) patients. The pattern of pigmentation was diffuse in 
18 (54.54%) patients, reticular in seven (21.2%), blotchy in five (15.2%), linear
in two (6.1%) and perifollicular in one (3%). Twenty patients had positive
serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV), with significantly higher serum liver
enzymes (ALT and AST). Of the 13 patients, who were treated with tacrolimus
Ointment, seven (53.8%) showed appreciable lightening of the pigmentation after
an average of 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HCV may be one of the factors associated with LPP, 
in those who have a tendency to develop LPP. However, this possible association
should be interpreted carefully. In addition, tacrolimus ointment could have a
beneficial role in the treatment of LPP.
