OBJECTIVES: Differences among cancer cells within a tumor are important in
tumorigenesis and treatment resistance, yet no measure of intratumor
heterogeneity is suitable for routine application. We developed a quantitative
measure of intratumor genetic heterogeneity, based on differences among mutated
loci in the mutant-allele fractions determined by next-generation sequencing
(NGS) of tumor DNA. We then evaluated the application of this measure to head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed published electronically available NGS results
for 74 HNSCC. For each tumor we calculated mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity
(MATH) as the ratio of the width to the center of its distribution of
mutant-allele fractions among tumor-specific mutated loci.
RESULTS: Intratumor heterogeneity assessed by MATH was higher in three
poor-outcome classes of HNSCC: tumors with disruptive mutations in the TP53 gene 
(versus wild-type TP53 or non-disruptive mutations), tumors negative versus
positive for human papillomavirus (even when restricted to tumors having
wild-type TP53), and HPV-negative tumors from smokers with more pack-years of
cigarette exposure (with TP53 status taken into account).
CONCLUSION: The relation of this type of intratumor heterogeneity to HNSCC
outcome classes supports its further evaluation as a prognostic biomarker. As NGS
of tumor DNA becomes widespread in clinical research and practice, MATH should
provide a simple, quantitative, and clinically practical biomarker to help
evaluate relations of intratumor genetic heterogeneity to outcome in any type of 
cancer.
