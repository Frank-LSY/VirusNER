PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy. 
Worldwide incidence is increasing and roughly 50% of patients present with a
primary lesion in the head and neck. This article discusses recent advances and
treatment recommendations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research has focused on the carcinogenesis of MCC, in
particular the role of Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCPyV) and its surrogate marker
large T-antigen. Together with cytokeratin 20 (CK20), other biomarkers like human
insulin gene enhancer-binding protein islet-1 (ISL1) and transcription factor
OCT4 may provide improved methods for diagnosis and ultimately, therapy.
SUMMARY: This review summarizes recent findings on MCC pathogenesis with a
special emphasis on the impact of MCPyV. It further presents an overview of
clinical aspects, and discusses treatment standards and emerging perspectives.
