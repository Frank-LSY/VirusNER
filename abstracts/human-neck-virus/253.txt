Merkel Cell Virus (MCV) is a newly discovered polyomavirus, recently found in a
rare skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). However, MCV has also been
detected in some normal tissue samples. We tested and compared the relative
quantity of the MCV in a set of diverse human tissue samples with the MCC
samples. The levels of MCV in MCCs were over 60 times higher than the highest
values in all other tissues. Low quantities of MCV were detected in diverse
tissue samples independently of malignant or benign histologic status. Higher
levels of the virus were found in the upper aerodigestive tract, digestive
system, and saliva compared to the lung and genitourinary system samples. These
results confirm that MCV is widespread in the human body and suggest a possible
fecal-oral transmission route similar to the Hepatitis A virus. Despite
widespread presence of the virus, it appears that only neuroendocrine skin cells 
are susceptible to transformation by MCV.
