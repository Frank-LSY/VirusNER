OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The etiology of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Hunt syndrome) is
reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion of
the facial nerve, leading to neuritis. Although the mechanism of the VZV
reactivation is unclear, one possibility is that the reactivation involves a low 
level of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The aim of this study was to 
clarify the characteristics of the VZV-specific CMI in Hunt syndrome compared to 
that in Bell's palsy, and to obtain clues to its role in the development of Hunt 
syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.
METHODS: We determined the median spot numbers and examined VZV-specific CMI in
patients with Hunt syndrome and with Bell's palsy using interferon-γ
enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. We analyzed the relationship between
the value of VZV-specific CMI and days from disease onset.
RESULTS: The median spot number in Hunt syndrome (87.3 spot-forming cells
[SFCs]/4 × 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) was higher than that
in Bell's palsy (62.3 SFCs/4 × 10(5) PBMCs). Hunt syndrome showed a strong
relationship between the ELISPOT count and days from onset (r = 0.65). Within the
first 5 days from onset, no ELISPOT counts higher than 80 SFCs/4 × 10(5) PBMCs
were observed. On the other hand, no correlation was observed between the ELISPOT
count and days from onset in patients with Bell's palsy (r = -0.19).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that VZV-specific CMI in Hunt syndrome is low 
at disease onset and increases rapidly thereafter. Consequently, reduced
VZV-specific CMI may play an important role in the reactivation of VZV in the
facial nerve, leading to Hunt syndrome.
