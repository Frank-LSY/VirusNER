Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common form of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma. Multiple approaches have been applied to treat this type
of cancer; however, no significant improvement in survival rate has been
achieved. In the present study, the role of nemo‑like kinase (NLK) in human
laryngeal carcinoma Hep‑2 cells was investigated. NLK has been identiﬁed as an
important regulator of cell growth, patterning and cell death in a variety of
organisms. Lentivirus‑mediated‑shRNA was employed to silence endogenous NLK
expression. Downregulation of the expression of NLK following lentivirus
infection was confirmed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction and western blot analysis. The effects of NLK downregulation on Hep‑2
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were analyzed using an MTT assay
and flow cytometry, respectively. Downregulation of NLK also inhibited
tumorigenesis and regulated the expression of cell cycle protein expression
levels. Therefore, it was hypothesized that NLK is necessary for cell survival
and tumorigenesis in laryngeal cancer cells. Furthermore, the absence of NLK may 
lead to cancer cell death. Collectively, the results of the present study
demonstrated that the lentivirus‑mediated targeted disruption of NLK may be a
promising therapeutic method for the treatment of laryngeal cancer.
