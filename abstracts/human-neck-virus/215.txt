OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among patients living in North-East
Italy, by assessing HPV-DNA positivity in all tumors and additional markers
whenever possible.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: HPV types, viral load, viral RNA, HPV16/18 E6 protein and
p16INK4a and pRb expression were determined in primary tumor tissues from 247
HNSCC patients. Tumor-specific HPV seropositivity was analyzed in 102 patients.
RESULTS: Tumor HPV-DNA prevalence was 8.5% overall (21/247) and 27% in oropharynx
(17/63). HPV16 accounted for 95% of all HPV types found. Among HPV-DNA+ tumors,
type-concordant HPV E6*I RNA prevalence was 79%. HPV DNA+ RNA+ tumors showed high
viral load, up-regulated p16INK4a, down-regulated pRb and presence of HPV16 E6
protein. Eight cases showed tumor-specific HPV seropositivity, all
type-concordant with the tumor. Tumors were defined as HPV-driven when positive
for HPV-DNA plus 2 additional HPV transformation-related markers.
CONCLUSION: Relative prevalence of HPV-driven tumors (14 HPV16, 1 HPV58) was 6%
overall and 20% among oropharyngeal cancers. In the oropharynx the HPV-driven
group showed a trend for better survival versus the HPV-negative group. The
relative prevalence of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer is low in North-East Italy
as compared to Western and Northern Europe.
