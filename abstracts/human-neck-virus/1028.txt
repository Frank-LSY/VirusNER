HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), more specifically
the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer, is dramatically increasing in
industrialized countries. According to what has been learned from anogenital
vaccination programs, there are reasons to believe that current human
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations may be potentially effective also against
HNSCC. However, before specific results on HNSCC are available, one must keep in 
mind that carcinogenesis in the head and neck region may differ from that of the 
anogenital tract. Furthermore, the current evidence supports the view that HPV
infection is much more complex than simply a sexually transmitted disease. HPV is
present in the semen, placenta and in the newborns, and these infections of the
newborns create cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against HPV, including the T memory 
cells. Acquisition of HPV infection in early life will rise new series of
questions in the field of HPV vaccination.
