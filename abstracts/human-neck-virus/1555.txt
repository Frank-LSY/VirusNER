The use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for HPV DNA detection 
by PCR from biopsy materials is not entirely clear in retrospective studies. The 
aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness and efficiency of FFPE tissues
from laryngeal cancer (LSCC) in HPV detection by immunohistochemistry reaction
(IHC) and PCR-DNA enzyme immunoassay method (PCR/DEIA) and to compare with HPV
detection from DFT. HPV-DNA was amplified from 54 FFPE tissues from LSCC
specimens by the short PCR fragment (SPF10) primer set using PCR/DNA method and
monoclonal anti Human Papillomavirus antibodies in IHC. In the same patients 54
specimens were collected and immediately deep-frozen and stored at (-70°C) to
(-80°C). All the FFPE and deep-frozen tissue (DFT) specimens were positive for
β-globin amplification. HPV was detected by two methods (SPF10 PCR/DEIA and IHC) 
in 14 (25.92%) out of 54 specimens from FFPE. Significant differences were found 
between the HPV detection using PCR/DEIA method and IHC method in FFPE tissues.
The comparative analysis of the 54 samples after assuming PCR method in FFPE
tissues showed accuracy of 92.6%, sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 93.9%. 
The FFPE tissues method has high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy when used 
to detect HPV DNA by PCR reaction and it is comparable to DFT results. DNA
quality of FFPE samples is adequate and it can be used in HPV-DNA detection and
in retrospective studies on LSCC.
