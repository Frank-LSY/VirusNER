A relatively new entity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma located in the
oropharynx and associated to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is on the rise. This 
cancer represents a distinct entity from the non-HPV tumours, holds different
biological characteristics and responds differently to treatment. An outcome
analysis of locoregionally-advanced oropharyngeal versus non-oropharyngeal
cancers treated with chemo-radiotherapy revealed a statistically significant
improvement for oropharyngeal cancers, which are thought to be due to their
HPV-association. Consequently, more attention is paid to HPV-related head and
neck cancers, given that HPV status serves as prognostic marker in oropharyngeal 
cancer patients. Yet, HPV positivity is a simplistic approach for risk
stratification, thus more robust biomarkers are needed to fulfil this task.
Despite differences in clinical response, HPV-related oral cancers undergo
similar therapy to their non-HPV counterparts. This review discusses future
treatment directions for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers based on
radiobiological rationale and current clinical evidence.
