Distinguishing branchial cleft cysts (BCCs) from cystic metastases of a human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is challenging. Fine needle aspirates (FNAs) from cystic metastasis may be non-representative, while reactive squamous cells from BCC can be atypic. Based on cytology and with the support of HPV DNA positivity many centers treat cystic metastasis oncological and thus patients are spared neck dissection. To do so safely, one must investigate whether HPV DNA and p16
