PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) positivity is associated with
favourable survival in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). We report
here a study of the prognostic significance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT functional
parameters and HPV-16 infection in OPSCC patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 60 patients with stage III or IV OPSCC who
had had a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan and had completed concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (n = 58) or curative radiotherapy (n = 2). All patients were
followed up for ≥24 months or until death. We determined total lesion glycolysis 
(TLG) and the maximal standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) of the primary tumour
and neck lymph nodes from the pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan. Optimal cut-offs 
of the (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters were obtained by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Pretherapy tumour biopsies were studied by
polymerase chain reaction to determine HPV infection status.
RESULTS: The pretherapy tumour biopsies were positive for HPV-16 in 12 patients
(20.0 %). Cox regression analyses revealed HPV-16 positivity and tumour TLG
>135.3 g to be independently associated with overall survival (p = 0.027 and
0.011, respectively). However, only tumour TLG >135.3 g was independently
associated with progression-free survival, disease-free survival and locoregional
control (p = 0.011, 0.001 and 0.034, respectively). A scoring system was
formulated to define distinct overall survival groups using tumour TLG and HPV-16
status. Patients positive for HPV-16 and with tumour TLG ≤135.3 g experienced
better survival than those with tumour TLG >135.3 g and no HPV infection
(p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Tumour TLG was an independent predictor of survival in patients with 
locally advanced OPSCC. A scoring system was developed and may serve as a risk
stratification strategy for guiding therapy.
