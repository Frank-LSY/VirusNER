OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of
patients with squamous cell carcinoma localized to different supraglottic
subregions.
METHODS: Clinicopathologic data were reviewed retrospectively for 111 patients
with supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma who were diagnosed between January 1,
1995 and December 31, 2005 and were initially treated with surgery. DNA from
human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and (or /and) HPV 18 were detected in all the 111
supraglottic carcinoma specimens using in situ hybridization. Survival analysis
was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, factors were compared using log-rank
test, and prognostic factors were determined using Cox proportional hazards
model. The relationship between subregions and clinicopathologic factors was
analyzed using Chi-square tests.
RESULTS: HPV prevalence differed between patients with aryepiglottic fold
carcinoma and ventricle carcinoma (P < .05). The local-regional control rates,
overall survival rates or cancer specific survival rates were significantly
different between different subregions. Univariate analysis indicated that pTNM
classification, pN spread, and subregion were associated with prognosis (P <
.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that pTNM classification and subregion were
associated with supraglottic carcinoma prognosis. The survival rate was better
for patients with carcinoma of the epiglottis or ventricular bands compared to
those with carcinoma in the aryepiglottic fold or ventricle (P = .012).
CONCLUSIONS: Subregion may be a new prognostic factor for supraglottic squamous
cell carcinoma. Different supraglottic carcinoma subregions have distinct
clinical features such as HPV expression, lymph node metastasis rate,
local-regional control and prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to subdivide
supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas into several subregion groups to
individualize therapy.
