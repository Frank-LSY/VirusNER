Conclusion EBV radiosensitized the p53 mutant tobacco associated head and neck
cell line, FaDu. Objectives In the head and neck, HPV is a major risk factor
associated with tonsil and base of tongue cancers, while a majority of
undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancers are positive for EBV. Clinically, head
and neck tumors positive for HPV or EBV are more radiosensitive than tumors
associated with tobacco and alcohol. This study aimed to evaluate whether viral
infections can sensitize tobacco-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
cell line that harbors multiple mutations, especially TP53, to radiotherapy.
Method Four FaDu cell lines (vector control - FaDu-DN; FaDu expressing HPV16
E6/E7 - FaDu-HPV; FaDu infected with EBV - FaDu-EBV; and FaDu-HPV infected with
EBV - FaDu-HE) were evaluated for their radiation sensitivity using clonogenic
assay. Cell cycle, protein expression, apoptosis, and cellular senescence were
analyzed. Results FaDu-EBV and FaDu-HE exhibited significantly increased
radiosensitivity in comparison with the control cell line. Radiation-induced cell
cycle arrest was altered in all cell lines expressing viral genes. The observed
distribution of cells at G1 and S phases was associated with a significant
increase in expression of p21 protein along with decreased levels of pAKT/AKT and
pERK/ERK ratio (p < 0.05) and increased cellular senescence (p < 0.05).
