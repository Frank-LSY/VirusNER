Whether humoral immunity plays a role in HPV type 6 or 11 virus-mediated
Juvenile-onset Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (JORRP) remains unknown. In
the present study, serum total IgG level in 44 JORRP patients was significantly
decreased compared with that in 40 healthy controls. Moreover, expanded CD3-CD19+
B cells with down-regulation of CD23, CD40, HLA-DR and up-regulation of CD86
expression were found in the peripheral blood of JORRP patients. Flow cytometry
analysis of B-cell compartment showed that the frequency of both CD19+CD27hi
plasma cells and CD19+CD27+ memory B cells were decreased in JORRP patients.
Importantly, although the proportion of circulating CXCR5+PD1hi Tfh cells was not
changed, the function of Tfh cells were greatly impaired with reduced ability of 
IL-21 secretion to promote B cell maturation. Association analysis by the
Kaplan-Meier method revealed that IL-21 secreting Tfh cell was positively
correlated to the CD27+ B cell subset frequency, the serum IgG level and the
frequency of recurrence in JORRP patients, but negatively correlated to the
percentage of IgD+CD27- B cell. We concluded that a reduced IL-21 secretion by
Tfh cells may limit B cell maturation and antibody production in JORRP patients
and Tfh cell-derived IL-21 might be associated with JORRP outcome in clinic.
