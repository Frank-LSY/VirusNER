BACKGROUND: An emerging epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
oropharyngeal cancer has been proposed. The purpose of this study was for us to
compare the sexual behaviors of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
oropharynx (SCCOP) and patients with squamous cell carcinoma of non-oropharyngeal
(SCCNOP) head and neck sites to expand our understanding of sexual behavior as a 
risk factor for HPV-associated head and neck cancer.
METHODS: The sexual history of 165 patients with SCCOP and 87 patients with
SCCNOP was determined in a hospital-based case-to-case comparison study.
RESULTS: Patients with SCCOP were significantly more likely than patients with
SCCNOP to have had >9 lifetime sex partners (odds ratio [OR], 39.2; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 8.2-187.3), to have engaged in oral-genital sex (OR,
3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-11.1), and to have had >4 oral-genital sex partners (OR, 8.6;
95% CI, 2.2-33.4).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that some risk factors are
site-specific and provide further evidence that certain sexual behaviors increase
the risk of HPV-associated SCCOP.
