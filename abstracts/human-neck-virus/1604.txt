with oropharyngeal carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of human papillomavirus
subclinical infection in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in
Japan.
METHODS: Over a 9-year period, a retrospective case comparison study of the
pathology database was conducted at the University of Tokyo to identify samples
of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We performed in situ hybridization for 
human papillomavirus-DNA to identify subclinical human papillomavirus infections 
among patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Second primary
malignancies were classified as synchronous, if identified within 6 months of the
diagnosis of the first tumor, or metachronous, if identified after this 6-month
period. Univariate and multivariate analyses using logistic stepwise regression
models were performed to identify factors associated with synchronous and
metachronous second primary malignancy.
RESULTS: Of the 150 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, 14%
(21/150) and 20.7% (31/150) developed synchronous and metachronous second primary
malignancies, respectively. Esophageal carcinoma was the most frequent second
primary malignancy (10/21 for synchronous and 10/31 for metachronous second
primary malignancies). The prevalence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
positive for human papillomavirus was 31% (47/150). Multivariate analysis
identified alcohol consumption as a significant unfavorable risk factor for the
occurrence of synchronous second primary malignancy, and either a human
papillomavirus-negative status or N0 classification was a significant unfavorable
risk factor for the occurrence of metachronous second primary malignancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the human papillomavirus status may help identify
patients at risk for metachronous second primary malignancy. Upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy is very important in the diagnosis of oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma among heavy drinkers in Japan.
