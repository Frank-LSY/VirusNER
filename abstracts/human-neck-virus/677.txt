The role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been established for anogenital lesions but still remains controversial for carcinomas in other sites. The aim of this study was to determine the α-HPV and β-HPV prevalence and their association with p16 expression, sun exposure, and clinicopathological findings in patients with Bowen's disease (BD).
