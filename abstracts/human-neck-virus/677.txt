PURPOSE: To evaluate if herpes zoster virus (HZV) reactivation may be considered 
in the aetiology of cervical radiculopathy.
METHODS: The study group was composed of 110 patients (52 M-58F;mean
age ± SD:46.5 ± 6.12; range:40-73) with a clinical diagnosis of cervical
radiculopathy. Patients with signs of chronic damage on neurophysiological
studies were submitted to an X-ray and to an MRI of the cervical spine in order
to clarify the cause of the cervical radiculopathy and were investigated for a
possible reactivation of HZV; HZV reactivation was considered as "recent" or
"antique" if it occurs within or after 24 months from the onset of symptoms,
respectively. Data were submitted to statistics.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (34,5%,16 M-22F) had a history of HZV
reactivation: four (2 M-2F) were "recent" and 34 (14 M-20F) were "antique". In 68
of 110 participants (61,8%,30 M-38F), pathological signs on X-ray and/or MRI of
the cervical spine appeared; in the remaining 42 (38,2%,22 M-20F) X-ray and MRI
resulted as negative. Among patients with HZV reactivation, seven (18,4%) had a
"positive" X-ray-MRI while in 31 (81,6%) the instrumental exams were considered
as negative. The prevalence of "antique" HZV reactivations was statistically
greater in the group of patients with no pathological signs on X-ray/MRI of the
cervical spine with respect to the group with a pathological instrumental exam
(p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: It may be useful to investigate the presence of a positive history
of HZV reactivation and to consider it as a long-term complication of a cervical 
root inflammation especially in patients in which X-ray and MRI of the cervical
spine did not show pathological findings.
