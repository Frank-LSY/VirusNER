PURPOSE: Despite the advent of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), the
prognosis of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients
remains particularly poor. Classically, HNSCC, especially oropharyngeal
carcinomas, associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) exhibits better treatment 
outcomes than HNSCCs in non-infected patients, eliciting a call for the
de-escalation of current therapies. To improve the management of HNSCC patients, 
we aimed to determine the impact of active HPV infection on patient response,
recurrence and survival after CCRT in a population of heavy tobacco and alcohol
consumers.
METHODS: Paraffin-embedded samples from 218 advanced HNSCC patients, mostly
smokers and/or drinkers treated by CCRT, were tested for the presence of HPV DNA 
by surrogate type-specific E6/E7 qPCR and p16 immunohistochemistry. Associations 
between the response to CCRT and patient outcomes according to HPV status and
clinical data were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and both univariate and
multivariate Cox regression.
RESULTS: Type-specific E6/E7 PCR demonstrated HPV positivity in 20 % of HNSCC.
Regarding HPV status, we did not find any significant relation with response to
therapy in terms of progression-free survival or overall survival. However, we
observed a significantly worse prognosis for consumers of alcohol and tobacco
compared to nondrinkers (p = 0.003) and non-smokers (p = 0.03). Survival analyses
also revealed that the outcome is compromised in stage IV patients (p = 0.007)
and, in particular, for oral cavity, hypopharynx and oropharynx carcinoma
patients (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The risk of death from HNSCC significantly increases when patients
are exposed to tobacco and alcohol during their therapy, regardless of HPV
status.
