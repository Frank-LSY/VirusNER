AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC), with an increasing incidence. The present study aimed to
determine the changing incidence of HPV in patients with OPSCC in the period
1980-2009 and its influence on survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly sampled 158 patients from a cohort of 828
patients with OPSCC stratified by decade (1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009).
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material was tested for HPV DNA by SPF-10
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemically stained for p16 and
p53.
RESULTS: DNA from 146 patients was suitable for HPV detection. HPV DNA was
detected in 13/47 (28%), 18/47 (38%), and 20/52 (38%) patients in the cohorts of 
1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2009, respectively (p-value for trend=0.269). Lack
of further increase during the most recent decade is inconsistent with the rising
incidence and higher prevalence reported in other Western countries. Patients
with HPV-positive OPSCC had a better survival in spite of higher tumor stage.
