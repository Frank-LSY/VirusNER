OBJECTIVE: To investigate rates and predictors of change in bone mineral density 
(BMD) in a cohort of aging men with or at risk for HIV infection.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study among 230 HIV-infected and 159 HIV-uninfected 
men aged at least 49 years.
METHODS: Longitudinal analyses of annual change in BMD at the femoral neck, total
hip, and lumbar spine.
RESULTS: At baseline, 46% of men had normal BMD, 42% had osteopenia, and 12% had 
osteoporosis. Of those men with normal BMD, 14% progressed to osteopenia and 86% 
continued to have normal BMD. Of the men initially with osteopenia, 12%
progressed to osteoporosis and 83% continued to have osteopenia. Osteopenia
incidence per 100 person-years at risk was 2.6 for HIV-uninfected men and 7.2 for
HIV-infected men; osteoporosis incidence was 2.2 per 100 person-years at risk
among men with osteopenia, regardless of HIV status. In multivariable analysis of
annual change in BMD at the femoral neck, we found a significant interaction
between heroin use and AIDS diagnosis, such that the greatest bone loss occurred 
with both AIDS and heroin use (adjusted predicted mean annual bone loss 0.0196
g/cm). Hepatitis C virus seropositivity was also associated with femoral neck
bone loss (P = 0.04). The interaction between AIDS and heroin use also was
associated with bone loss at the total hip, as was current methadone use (P <
0.01).
CONCLUSION: We found an association of heroin use and AIDS with BMD change,
suggesting that heroin users with AIDS may be at particular risk for bone loss.
