In Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic osteomalacia is caused by proximal renal
tubule dysfunction which leads to impaired reabsorption of amino acids, glucose, 
urate, and phosphate. We present a rare case of a 43-year-old Korean male who was
found to have insufficiency stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to
osteomalacia due to Fanconi syndrome. He had been receiving low-dose adefovir
dipivoxil (ADV, 10 mg/day) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus
infection for 7 years and he subsequently developed severe hypophosphatemia and
proximal renal tubule dysfunction. The incomplete femoral neck fracture was fixed
with multiple cannulated screws to prevent further displacement of the initial
fracture. After cessation of ADV and correction of hypophosphatemia with oral
phosphorus supplementation, the patient's clinical symptoms, such as bone pain,
muscle weakness, and laboratory findings improved.
