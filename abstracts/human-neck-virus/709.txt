Detection and genotyping of HPVs were performed in 43 primary NPCs (one WHO-I and 42 WHO-II/III) and 40 nasopharyngeal controls using PCR-based HPV genotyping arrays. Localisation of high-risk HPV and Epstein-Barr virus genomes was performed in another 46 primary NPCs (five WHO-I and 41 WHO-II/III) and seven paired metastatic WHO-II/III NPCs using in situ hybridisation.
