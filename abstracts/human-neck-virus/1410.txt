PURPOSE: There is substantial heterogeneity within human papillomavirus
(HPV)-associated head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to
different outcomes; however, the molecular heterogeneity in this subgroup is
poorly characterized due to various historical reasons.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed unsupervised gene expression clustering on
deeply annotated (transcriptome and genome) HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts
(84 total primary tumors), including 18 HPV(-) HNC samples, to discover subtypes 
and characterize the differences between subgroups in terms of their HPV
characteristics, pathway activity, whole-genome somatic copy number alterations, 
and mutation frequencies.
RESULTS: We identified two distinct HPV(+) subtypes (namely HPV-KRT and HPV-IMU).
HPV-KRT is characterized by elevated expression of genes in keratinocyte
differentiation and oxidation-reduction process, whereas HPV-IMU has strong
immune response and mesenchymal differentiation. The differences in expression
are likely connected to the differences in HPV characteristics and genomic
changes. HPV-KRT has more genic viral integration, lower E2/E4/E5 expression
levels, and higher ratio of spliced to full-length HPV oncogene E6 than HPV-IMU; 
the subgroups also show differences in copy number alterations and mutations, in 
particular the loss of chr16q in HPV-IMU and gain of chr3q and PIK3CA mutation in
HPV-KRT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) HNC tumors provides
valuable molecular level information that point to two main carcinogenic paths.
Together, these results shed light on stratifications of the HPV(+) HNCs and will
help to guide personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients. Clin Cancer Res; 22(18);
