BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a major determinant of prognosis and
treatment planning of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Cysteine cathepsins
constitute a family of proteolytic enzymes with known role in the degradation of 
the extracellular matrix. Involvement in pathological processes, such as
inflammation and cancer progression, has been proved. The aim of the study was to
discover the clinicopathological and prognostic implications of cathepsin K
(CTSK) expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: Eighty-three patients with primary OSCC, treated surgically between 1996
and 2000, were included. Gene expression data were acquired from a previously
reported study. Human papilloma virus (HPV) status was previously determined by
an algorithm for HPV-16. CTSK Protein expression was semi-quantitatively
determined by immunohistochemistry in tumor and stromal cells. Expression data
were correlated with various clinicopathological variables.
RESULTS: Elevated gene and protein expression of CTSK were strongly associated to
LNM and perineural invasion (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis highlighted 
increased CTSK protein expression in tumor cells as the most significant
independent factor of lymphatic metastasis (OR = 7.65, CI:2.31-23.31, p = 0.001).
Survival analysis demonstrated CTSK protein expression in both stromal and tumor 
cells as significant indicators of poor 5-year disease specific survival
(HR = 2.40, CI:1.05-5.50, p = 0.038 for stromal cells; HR = 2.79, CI:1.02-7.64,
p = 0.045 for tumor cells).
CONCLUSION: Upregulation of CTSK seems to be associated with high incidence of
lymphatic spread and poor survival in OSCC. CTSK could therefore serve as a
predictive biomarker for OSCC.
