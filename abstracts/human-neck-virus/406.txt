BACKGROUND: The risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) associated 
with common human papillomavirus types has not been well defined.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 1034 individuals (486 incident
cases diagnosed with HNSCC and 548 population-based controls matched to cases by 
age, gender, and town of residence) in Greater Boston, MA. Sera were tested for
antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV)6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 L1.
RESULTS: HPV6 antibodies were associated with an increased risk of pharyngeal
cancer [odds ratio (OR)=1.6, 1.0-2.5], controlling for smoking, drinking, and
HPV16 seropositivity. In HPV16-seronegative subjects, high HPV6 titer was
associated with an increased risk of pharyngeal cancer (OR=2.3, 1.1-4.8) and oral
cancer (OR=1.9, 1.0-3.6), suggesting that the cancer risk associated with HPV6 is
independent of HPV16. There was no association between smoking and alcohol use
and HPV6 serostatus. Further, the risk of pharyngeal cancer associated with heavy
smoking was different among HPV6-seronegative (OR 3.1, 2.0-4.8) and
HPV6-seropositive subjects (OR=1.6, 0.7-3.5), while heavy drinking also appears
to confer differing risk among HPV6-negative (OR 2.3, 1.5-3.7) and -positive
subjects (OR=1.3, 0.6-2.9).
CONCLUSIONS: There may be interactions between positive serology and drinking and
smoking, suggesting that the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus in HNSCC
involves complex interactions with tobacco and alcohol exposure.
