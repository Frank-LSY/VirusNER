The confirmation of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a causative agent for a subset 
of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck has resulted in a growing
expectation for HPV testing in head and neck cancers. An increasing understanding
of HPV-related tumorigenesis has informed this evaluation process in a manner
that is moving wide scale, indiscriminant, and nonstandardized testing toward a
more directed, clinically relevant, and standardized approach. This review
addresses the current state of HPV detection and focuses on the importance,
appropriate time, and need for HPV testing.
