BACKGROUND AND AIM: Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive tumours.
Tumour-specific T cells are frequently identified in patients with cancer,
although they fail to control tumour progression. A family of proteins called
co-stimulatory receptors regulate the function of T cells and may account for T
cell dysfunction in cancer. Our aim was to characterise co-stimulatory receptors 
on T cells in HNC patients to identify novel targets for immunotherapy.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from HNC patients and
healthy controls and the expression of co-stimulatory (OX40, 4-1BB, ICOS) and
co-inhibitory (CTLA-4, PD1) receptors was analysed on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells
using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We found that the levels of co-stimulatory receptors OX40 and 4-1BB were
significantly lower on CD4(+) T cells from HNC patients. This was more pronounced
in locally advanced tumours (T3/T4) compared to early carcinomas (T1/T2). PD-1
levels were higher on CD8(+) T cells in HNC patients compared to controls. Human 
papilloma virus (HPV)-specific CD8(+) T cells appeared to be more affected than
Influenza-specific T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that expression of co-stimulatory receptors on 
T cells from HNC patients is imbalanced with a preponderance of inhibitory
signals, and reduction of stimulatory signals, especially in advanced disease.
Restoring this balance could improve T cell therapy outcomes in HNC.
