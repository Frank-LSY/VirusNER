Viral meningitis caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an uncommon
neurological complication of herpes zoster. It may occur before or after the
onset of the vesicular rash along the dermatomal distribution, which is the
classic presentation of herpes zoster. We describe a case of a 51-year-old
immunocompetent Caucasian man who presented with neck and severe right-sided
facial pain. Eight days later, he had photophobia and papular rash on his
forehead. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination confirmed aseptic meningitis and 
CSF PCR detected the presence of VZV DNA. Neurological complications of VZV
infection, such as aseptic meningitis, may be difficult to diagnose and can cause
delay in treatment, especially in cases with late onset of dermatological
manifestations of herpes zoster. Definite diagnosis requires evidence of acute
VZV infection in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
