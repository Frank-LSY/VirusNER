HPV detection in fine needle aspirates from suspected head and neck metastasis
may be useful in clinching the diagnosis of HPV related oral squamous cell
carcinoma. Ascertaining the HPV status of a particular tumor on cytological
specimens could be useful for prognostication as HPV-related tumors appear to
have a better prognosis and clinical outcome. The various techniques of detection
are reviewed.
