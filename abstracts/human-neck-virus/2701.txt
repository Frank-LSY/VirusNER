BACKGROUND: Better insights into the molecular changes involved in
virus-associated and -independent head and neck cancer may advance our knowledge 
of HNC carcinogenesis and identify critical disease biomarkers. Here we aimed to 
characterize the expression profiles in a matched set of well-characterized
HPV-dependent and HPV-independent tonsillar tumors and equivalent immortalized
keratinocyte clones to define potential and clinically relevant biomarkers of HNC
of different etiology.
METHODS: Fresh frozen tonsillar cancer tissues were analyzed together with
non-malignant tonsillar tissues and compared with cervical tumors and normal
cervical tissues. Furthermore, relative miRNAs abundance levels of primary and
immortalized human keratinocyte clones were evaluated. The global quantitation of
miRNA gene abundance was performed using a TaqMan Low Density Array system. The
confirmation of differentially expressed miRNAs was performed on a set of
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples enriched for the tumor cell
fraction by macrodissection.
RESULTS: We defined 46 upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs characteristic for
the HPV-positive tonsillar tumors and 42 upregulated miRNAs and 42 downregulated 
miRNAs characteristic for HPV-independent tumors. In comparison with the
expression profiles in cervical tumors, we defined miR-141-3p, miR-15b-5p,
miR-200a-3p, miR-302c-3p, and miR-9-5p as specific for HPV induced malignancies. 
MiR-335-5p, miR-579-3p, and miR-126-5p were shared by the expression profiles of 
HPV-positive tonsillar tumors and of the HPV immortalized keratinocyte clones,
whereas miR-328-3p, miR-34c-3p, and miR-885-5p were shared by the miRNA profiles 
of HPV-negative tonsillar tumors and the HPV-negative keratinocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the miRNAs characteristic for HPV-induced tumors and
tonsillar tumors of different etiology, and the results were compared with those 
of the model system. Our report presents the basis for further investigations
leading to the identification of clinically relevant diagnostic and/or
therapeutic biomarkers for tumors of viral and non-viral etiology.
