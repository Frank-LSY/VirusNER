BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is potentially curable,
but treatment planning remains a challenge. Oncogenic human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive disease is often associated with a good prognosis compared with
HPV-negative disease. However, some HPV-positive HNSCC recurs, often with distant
metastases and significant treatment resistance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ
hybridization (ISH) for high-risk HPV, and comprehensive genomic profiling on
oropharyngeal HNSCC with basaloid features and particularly aggressive disease
course, noting a rare genetic event: a deleting mutation (exons 5-17) of the
tumor suppressor and dominant cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma 1 (RB1).
Genomic and transcriptomic data available through FoundationOne and The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) were reviewed for additional HNSCC cases with RB1
alterations.
CONCLUSION: RB1 alterations may have important prognostic implications,
particularly in the context of high p16 expression, in both HPV-positive and
HPV-negative HNSCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: E34-E39, 2017.
