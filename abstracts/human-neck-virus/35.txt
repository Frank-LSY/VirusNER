The significant increase in human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal 
carcinoma (OPC) over recent years has lead to a surge in research and an improved
understanding of the disease. Most patients with HPV-associated OPC present with 
cystic nodal metastases with a small primary tumour, and respond well to all
treatment modalities including primary surgery and primary chemoradiotherapy.
Current research is evaluating treatment de-escalation to reduce long-term
treatment-associated morbidities. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is
particularly relevant as the transoral approach allows small primary tumours to
be removed with lower morbidity than traditional surgical approaches. The current
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for oropharyngeal cancer does
not appropriately stratify HPV-associated OPC; hence, alternative risk
stratification and staging classifications are being proposed.
