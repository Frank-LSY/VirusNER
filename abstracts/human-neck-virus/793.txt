The most frequent DNA copy number gains were observed on chromosome arms 3q, 8q, 5p, 7q, 12p, and 12q. DNA copy number decreases occurred most frequently at 3p, 17p, 4q, and 5q. FISH analysis verified in part the observed alterations by CGH on dapped tissues and was especially able to detect the most frequent DNA copy changes in cytological specimens.
