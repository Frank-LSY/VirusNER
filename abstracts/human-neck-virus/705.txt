Human papillomavirus (HPV-16) E6 proteins inhibit apoptosis in both p53-dependent
and p53-independent manners. So it was relevant to assess the impact of such
infection on head and neck cancers and its relation to the inhibitors of
apoptosis (IAPs). CIAP2 is one of these IAPs that is postulated to upregulated by
E6 proteins of HPV-16 by amplification of the locus bearing it in many tissues.
In this study, we aimed to search for the amplification of the locus bearing
CIAP-2 and its relation to HPV-16 in head and neck cancer that may have
prognostic and therapeutic impacts on these patients. Total 30 patients diagnosed
as head and neck cancer (2 tissue samples were taken from each patient: from the 
tumor and from the safety margin). All samples were subjected to qualitative
polymerase chain reaction analysis for HPV-16 and qualitative and
semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of CIAP-2. There
was a significant association between HPV-16 and CIAP2 positivity and head and
neck tumors (P=0.01). CIAP-2 expression in malignant tissues was highly
associated with HPV-16 infection with 73.9% sensitivity and absolute specificity.
