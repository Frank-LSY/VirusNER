Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the maxillary sinus is a very rare neoplasm
that shares some characteristics with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) has been reported to be associated with LEC located outside of the
nasopharynx in Asian populations. A case report of a 64-year-old Asian female
with right-sided cheek mass which was diagnosed preoperatively as a maxillary
mass by paranasal sinus computed tomography scan is presented. Because maxillary 
sinus cancer with orbital invasion was considered, she underwent surgical removal
of a mass. Final pathology revealed LEC, which is presented in our report.
However, in situ hybridization assays returned negative results for Epstein-Barr 
virus. The patient underwent postoperative chemoradiotherapy, and has remained
disease-free during 3-year follow-up. Although a few cases in the maxillary LEC
have been reported, this is the first report describing the diagnosis and
treatment of LEC occurred in the maxillary sinus. Surgical removal and adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy may be useful in the treatment of more advanced maxillary LEC.
