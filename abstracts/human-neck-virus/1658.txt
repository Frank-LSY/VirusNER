PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) carries a distinct clinical behaviour. c-Met oncogene is an
important driver for tumour progression and its relationship with HPV in OPSCC
was explored in the present study.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Knockdown of HPV oncogene E6 or p53 alone and in combination
was performed to examine their effects on c-Met expression by Western blot and
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effects of c-Met inhibition
on cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation were examined in
HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Retrospectively
collected OPSCC patient specimens (N = 78) were stained for c-Met by
immunohistochemistry and the staining levels were correlated with HPV status and 
patient outcomes.
RESULTS: E6 knockdown decreased c-Met protein and mRNA expression in HPV-positive
HNSCC cells, which was partially abolished by the elimination of p53. Reducing
c-Met decreased cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation in
HPV-positive HNSCC cells. In OPSCC patient samples, high c-Met expression was
associated with HPV-positive status (OR = 4.11, 95%CI: 1.16-14.55, P = 0.028) and
tumour stage (OR = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.08-0.93, P = 0.039) by multivariable analysis. 
In T3/T4 stage patients, high c-Met expression was associated with HPV positivity
and low p53 levels, supporting an axis of E6-p53-c-Met regulation. Furthermore,
high c-Met expression was marginally associated with poor disease-free survival
in HPV-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that c-Met may serve as a novel target for
treating HPV-associated OPSCC. The data also demonstrate that HPV E6 upregulates 
c-Met expression partially through p53 downregulation.
