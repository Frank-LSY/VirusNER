BACKGROUND: Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the
development of cervical carcinoma. By contrast, the role of HPV in the
pathogenesis of other malignancies, such as head and neck cancers, is less well
characterised. This study aimed to address key information gaps by conducting a
systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of HPV infection in head
and neck cancers, focusing on data for European populations.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and grey literature sources were systematically searched
for primary studies that were published in English between July 2002 and July
2012, and which reported on the prevalence of HPV infection in head and neck
cancers in European populations. Studies on non-European populations, those not
published in English, and those assessing patients co-infected with human
immunodeficiency virus were excluded. Eligible studies were combined in a
meta-analysis. In addition, the potential statistical association between the
head and neck cancers and certain HPV types was investigated.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine publications met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of
HPV of any type in 3,649 patients with head and neck cancers was 40.0% (95%
confidence interval, 34.6% to 45.5%), and was highest in tonsillar cancer (66.4%)
and lowest in pharyngeal (15.3%) and tongue (25.7%) cancers. There were no
statistically significant associations between the HPV types analysed and the
geographical setting, type of sample analysed or type of primer used to analyse
samples in head and neck cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPV infection in European patients with head and
neck cancers is high but varies between the different anatomical sites of these
malignancies. There appears to be no association between HPV type and
geographical setting, type of samples analysed or type of primer used to analyse 
samples in such cancers.
