OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer
(oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, OPSCC) is biologically and clinically
different from HPV negative OPSCC. Here, we evaluate the use of a radiomic
approach to identify the HPV status of OPSCC.
METHODS: Four independent cohorts, totaling 778 OPSCC patients with HPV
determined by p16 were collected. We randomly assigned 80% of all data for model 
training (N = 628) and 20% for validation (N = 150). On the pre-treatment CT
images, 902 radiomic features were calculated from the gross tumor volume.
Multivariable modeling was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator. To assess the impact of CT artifacts in predicting HPV (p16), a model
was developed on all training data (Mall) and on the artifact-free subset of
training data (Mno art). Models were validated on all validation data (Vall), and
the subgroups with (Vart) and without (Vno art) artifacts. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was performed to compare HPV status based on p16 and radiomic model
predictions.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator curve for Mall and Mno art ranged
between 0.70 and 0.80 and was not significantly different for all validation
data sets. There was a consistent and significant split between survival curves
with HPV status determined by p16 [p = 0.007; hazard ratio (HR): 0.46], Mall (p =
0.036; HR: 0.55) and Mno art (p = 0.027; HR: 0.49).
CONCLUSION: This study provides proof of concept that molecular information can
be derived from standard medical images and shows potential for radiomics as
imaging biomarker of HPV status. Advances in knowledge: Radiomics has the
potential to identify clinically relevant molecular phenotypes.
