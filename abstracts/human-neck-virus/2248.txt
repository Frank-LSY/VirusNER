BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is an oncogenic virus that
causes oropharyngeal cancers, and it has a favorable outcome after the treatment.
Unlike in oropharyngeal cancer, the prevalence and role of high-risk HPV in the
etiology of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect and prognostic
significance of high-risk HPV in patients with HPSCC.
METHODS: The study included 64 subjects with HPSCC who underwent radical surgery 
with or without radiation-based adjuvant therapy. Primary tumor sites were the
pyriform sinus in 42 patients, posterior pharyngeal wall in 19 patients, and
postcricoid area in 3 patients. High-risk HPV in situ hybridization was performed
to detect HPV infection.
RESULTS: The positive rate of high-risk HPV in situ hybridization was 10.9%
(7/64). There was a significant difference in the fraction of positive high-risk 
HPV among pyriform sinus cancer (16.7%), posterior pharyngeal wall cancer (0%),
and postcricoid area cancer (0%) (p = 0.042). The laryngoscopic examination
revealed a granulomatous and exophytic appearance in 85.7% (6/7) of patients with
high-risk HPV-positive pyriform sinus cancer, but in only 31.4% (11/35) of
patients with high-risk HPV-negative pyriform sinus cancer (p = 0.012).
Significant correlations were found between positive high-risk HPV and younger
age (p = 0.050) and non-smoking status (p = 0.017). HPV-positive patients had a
significantly better disease-free survival (p = 0.026) and disease-specific
survival (p = 0.047) than HPV-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: High-risk HPV infection is significantly related to pyriform sinus
cancer in patients with HPSCC.
