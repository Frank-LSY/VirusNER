Surgical pathology of the sinonasal region (i.e., nasal cavity and the paranasal 
sinuses) is notoriously difficult, due in part to the remarkable diversity of
neoplasms that may be encountered in this area. In addition, a number of
neoplasms have been only recently described in the sinonasal tract, further
compounding the difficulty for pathologists who are not yet familiar with them.
This manuscript will review the clinicopathologic features of some of the
recently described sinonasal tumor types: NUT midline carcinoma, HPV-related
carcinoma with adenoid cystic-like features, SMARCB1 (INI-1) deficient sinonasal 
carcinoma, biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, and adamantinoma-like Ewing family
tumor.
