BACKGROUND: Radioresistance remains a critical issue in the use of radiotherapy
for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study
evaluated the efficacy of combination treatment with OBP-301, a
telomerase-specific replication-selective adenovirus, and radiotherapy in
overcoming radioresistance by examining its effect on radiation-resistant HNSCC
cells.
METHODS: Radiation-resistant HNSCC cells were treated with OBP-301 and radiation 
in vitro and in an orthotopic nude mouse model in vivo and synergism was
assessed. Apoptosis and expression of MRN complex, which plays a key role in DNA 
repair machinery, were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Infection with OBP-301 was found to enhance the antitumor efficacy of
radiation both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting MRN complex expression and
increasing apoptosis induction.
CONCLUSION: Combined OBP-301 and radiation therapy seems to overcome
radioresistance in HNSCC cells by inhibiting DNA repair machinery, and may thus
be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating HNSCC.
