We present a case of non-keratinizing carcinoma of the nasopharynx (NK-NPC) with 
an unusual histopathological pattern. The neoplastic cells were arranged in
anastomosing cords embedded in a stroma which contained a significant component
of alcian blue-positive myxoid substance forming a reticular pattern. These
histopathological features gave an initial impression of a salivary gland-type
carcinoma. On immunohistochemistry the tumor cells were strongly and diffusely
positive for cytokeratins (AE1-3 and 5/6) and p63 and there was strong and
diffuse nuclear positivity for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA on in situ
hybridization. This case highlights the histomorphological variability of NK-NPC.
Awareness of the histological spectrum of NK-NPC is important in clinical
practice and this is not always adequately highlighted in currently used standard
textbooks of Head and Neck Pathology.
