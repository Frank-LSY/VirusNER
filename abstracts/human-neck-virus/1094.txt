Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are oncogenic DNA viruses implicated in squamous
cell carcinomas of several anatomic sites, as well as endocervical
adenocarcinomas. Identification of HPV is an actionable finding in some
carcinomas, potentially influencing tumor classification, prognosis, and
management. We incorporated capture probes for oncogenic HPV strains 16 and 18
into a broader next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel designed to identify
actionable mutations in solid malignancies. A total of 21 head and neck,
genitourinary, and gynecologic squamous cell carcinomas and endocervical
adenocarcinomas were sequenced as part of the UNCSeq project. Using p16
immunohistochemical results as the gold standard, we set a cutoff for proportion 
of aligned HPV reads that maximized performance of our NGS assay (92% sensitive, 
100% specific for HPV). These results suggest that sequencing of oncogenic
pathogens can be incorporated into targeted NGS panels, extending the clinical
utility of genomic assays.
