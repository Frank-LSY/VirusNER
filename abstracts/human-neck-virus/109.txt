Surgically removed palatine tonsils provide a conveniently accessible source of T
and B lymphocytes to study the interplay between foreign pathogens and the host
immune system. In this study we have characterised the distribution of human
adenovirus (HAdV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in
purified tonsillar T and B cell-enriched fractions isolated from three patient
age groups diagnosed with tonsillar hypertrophy and chronic/recurrent
tonsillitis. HAdV DNA was detected in 93 out of 111 patients (84%), while EBV DNA
was detected in 58 patients (52%). The most abundant adenovirus type was HAdV-5
(68%). None of the patients were positive for HCMV. Furthermore, 43 patients
(39%) showed a co-infection of HAdV and EBV. The majority of young patients
diagnosed with tonsillar hypertrophy were positive for HAdV, whereas all adult
patients diagnosed with chronic/recurrent tonsillitis were positive for either
HAdV or EBV. Most of the tonsils from patients diagnosed with either tonsillar
hypertrophy or chronic/recurrent tonsillitis showed a higher HAdV DNA copy number
in T compared to B cell-enriched fraction. Interestingly, in the majority of the 
tonsils from patients with chronic/recurrent tonsillitis HAdV DNA was detected in
T cells only, whereas hypertrophic tonsils demonstrated HAdV DNA in both T and B 
cell-enriched fractions. In contrast, the majority of EBV positive tonsils
revealed a preference for EBV DNA accumulation in the B cell-enriched fraction
compared to T cell fraction irrespective of the patients' age.
