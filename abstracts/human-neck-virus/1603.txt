Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, clinically aggressive neuroendocrine
carcinoma of the skin; MCC is 40 times less common as compared to melanoma. The
most frequently reported sites have been the head and neck, extremities, and
trunk. Potential mimics include malignant melanoma, lymphoma, or metastatic small
cell (neuroendocrine) carcinomas. Histopathology of MCC resembles small cell
carcinoma both morphologically and on IHC. The possible cell of origin was
proposed as the Merkel cell, which functions as a mechanoreceptor. It has a high 
chance of local recurrence, regional and distant spread. In recent times, Merkel 
cell polyomavirus has been implicated as the causative agent for this tumor. The 
same agent has a reported etiologic association with other skin lesions,
including seborrheic keratosis.
