BACKGROUND: Our next generation sequencing (NGS)-based human papillomavirus (HPV)
genotyping assay showed a high degree of concordance with the Roche Linear Array 
(LA) with as little as 1.25 ng formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded-derived genomic
DNA in head and neck and cervical cancer samples. This sensitive genotyping assay
uses barcoded HPV PCR broad-spectrum general primers 5+/6+ (BSGP)5+/6+ applicable
to population studies, but it's diagnostic performance has not been tested in
cases with multiple concurrent HPV infections.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the positive and
negative predictive value (PPV and NPV), sensitivity and specificity of the NGS
assay to detect HPV genotype infections as compared to the LA. DNA was previously
extracted from ten anal swab samples from men who have sex with men in Nigeria
enrolled on the TRUST/RV368 cohort study. Two-sample tests of proportions were
used to examine differences in the diagnostic performance of the NGS assay to
detect high vs. low-risk HPV type-specific infections.
RESULTS: In total there were 94 type-specific infections detected in 10 samples
with a median of 9.5, range (9 to 10) per sample. Using the LA as the gold
standard, 84.4% (95% CI: 75.2-91.2) of the same anal type-specific infections
detected on the NGS assay had been detected by LA. The PPV and sensitivity
differed significantly for high risk (PPV: 90%, 95% CI: 79.5-96.2; sensitivity:
93.1%, 95% CI: 83.3-98.1) as compared to low risk HPV (PPV: 73%, 95% CI:
54.1-87.7; sensitivity: 61.1, 95% CI: 43.5-76.9) (all p < 0.05). The NPV for all 
types was 92.5% (95% CI: 88.4-95.4). The NPV and specificity were similar for
high and low risk HPVs (all p > 0.05). The NGS assay detected 10 HPV genotypes
that were not among the 37 genotypes found on LA (30, 32, 43, 44, 74, 86, 87, 90,
91, 114).
CONCLUSIONS: The NGS assay accurately detects multiple HPV infections in
individual clinical specimens with limited sample volume and has extended
coverage compared to LA.
