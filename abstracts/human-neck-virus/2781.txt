AIM: To evaluate occupational risk for cancer of the tongue, oral cavity or
pharynx after adjustment for alcohol and tobacco use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data covered 14.9 million people and 28,623 cases of
cancer of the tongue, oral cavity and pharynx in the Nordic countries 1961-2005. 
Alcohol consumption by occupation was estimated based on mortality from liver
cirrhosis and incidence of liver cancer. Smoking by occupation was estimated
based on the incidence of lung cancer.
RESULTS: Only few occupations had relative risks of over 1.5 for cancer of the
tongue, oral cavity and pharynx. These occupations included dentists, artistic
workers, hairdressers, journalists, cooks and stewards, seamen and waiters.
CONCLUSION: Several occupational categories, including dentists, had an increased
relative risk of tongue cancer. This new finding remains to be explained but
could be related to occupational chemical exposures, increased consumption of
alcohol and tobacco products, or infection with human papilloma virus.
