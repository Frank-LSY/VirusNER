BACKGROUND: Salivary gland malignancies are a very heterogeneous group of
cancers, with histologically > 20 different subtypes, and prognosis varies
greatly. Their etiology is unknown, however, a few small studies show presence of
human papillomavirus (HPV) in some subtypes, although the evidence for HPV having
a causal role is weak. The aim of this study was to investigate if HPV plays a
causal role in the development of different parotid salivary gland tumor
subtypes.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 107 parotid salivary gland formalin fixed
paraffin embedded tumors and 10 corresponding metastases, and tested for 27
different HPV types using a multiplex bead based assay. HPV DNA positive tumors
were stained for p16INK4a overexpression by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: One of the 107 malignant parotid salivary gland tumors (0.93%) and its
corresponding metastasis on the neck were positive for HPV16 DNA, and both also
overexpressed p16INK4a. The HPV positive primary tumor was a squamous cell
carcinoma; neither mucoepidermoid nor adenoid cystic tumors were found HPV
positive.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, HPV DNA analysis in a large number of malignant
parotid salivary gland tumors, including 12 different subtypes, did not show any 
strong indications that tested HPV types have a causal role in the studied
salivary gland tumor types.
