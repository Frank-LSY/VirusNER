Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane proteins (LMPs) expedite
progression of EBV-relevant cancers. Of the full set of LMPs, latent membrane
protein 1 (LMP1) was identified to uniquely augment store-operated Ca(2+) entry
(SOCE). Previously, we reported that the suppression of SOCE exhibited inhibitory
effects on cell migration and the extravasation from vasculature in EBV-negative 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. In this follow-up study, we aimed to expand
our understanding of the modulation of SOCE by LMP1 and test the possibility that
blockage of LMP1-modulated SOCE affects the LMP1-promoted metastatic potential.
Here we showed that suppressions of the LMP1-boosted SOCE blunted the
LMP1-promoted cell migration, VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and permeabilization in 
vitro. Blockage of SOCE inhibited vasculature-invasion of circulating cells and
distant metastatic colonization in vivo. Notably, utilizing VEGFR2-EGFP-tag
zebrafish we revealed that the LMP1-expressing cells arrested in a small-caliber 
vessel mobilized surrounding endothelial cells to facilitate
vasculature-invasion. Thus, the LMP1-boosted SOCE promotes metastatic potential
of NPC cells by solidifying their collaborations with the nearby non-cancer cells
through the manipulation of oncogenic Ca(2+) signaling. Our study highlights the 
advantage of using both conventional mammal and transgenic zebrafish for
developing a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the multiple steps of
invasion-metastasis cascade.
