BACKGROUND: In Romania, the most optimistic statistics give a 5 years survival
rate in approximately 33% of laryngo-pharyngeal cancer patients. Considering that
a cell carrying the viral DNA is originating from primary tumor, we have tested
whether HPV DNA could be detected in the blood cell of patients with laryngeal
cancer as a marker of disease progression and metastases.
METHODS: The study was performed on 85 patients (59 +/- 8.7 age) with
laryngo-pharyngeal cancer. HPV DNA was detected in tumor using nested PCR with
consensus primers, and also in local lymph nodes and/or blood cells from patients
HPV positive in primary tumor.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 75.29% of analyzed tumours, and all HPV16
positive samples were confirmed by mRNA E6 expression. 56.3% of patients
presented HPV DNA in peripheral circulation as confirmed by PCR with E6 HPV16
specific primers followed by Southern Blot.
CONCLUSION: Our results sustain that the detection of HPV DNA in blood is a
"surrogate marker" of metastasis when extension of metastasis cannot be
estimated, this observation is very important for management of cancer patients
with laryngopharyngeal localization.
