OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: From the 1950s through the 1960s, an unknown number of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) presented with metastases to
cervical lymph nodes from an unknown primary (SCCUP) and were not recognized as
oropharyngeal in origin. At present, pathologic evaluation of SCCUP for human
papillomavirus (HPV) improves discovery of occult oropharyngeal SCC and may
partially explain increased incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 13 cases of SCCUP diagnosed from 1956 to 1969
was performed. The probability of these cases of metastatic SCC to originate from
the oropharynx was assessed by characterizing their morphology (keratinizing vs. 
nonkeratinizing) and HPV status by in situ hybridization and p16 immunostaining.
RESULTS: Two cases of nonkeratinizing SCC positive for HPV by in situ
hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry were identified. These cases were most
likely of oropharyngeal origin.
CONCLUSIONS: These two cases can be added to the other 15 cases of HPV-positive
primary oropharyngeal SCC identified in our department from 1956 to 1969. When
determining the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC before the 1970s, a
correction factor of about +13% (2/15) accounting for modern pathologic workup of
SCCUP during the last couple of decades may be appropriate.
