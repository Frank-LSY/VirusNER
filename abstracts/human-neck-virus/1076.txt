OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) has increased 
in the United States. This has been driven by an increase in human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive OPC. Our objective is to determine trends in National Institutes
(NIH)-supported research funding and public interest in OPC.
METHODS: The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database was evaluated
for projects related to OPC between 2004 and 2015. Projects were evaluated for
total funding, relation to HPV, principal investigator departmental affiliation
and degree, and NIH agency or center responsible for grant. The Google Trends
database was evaluated for relative Internet search popularity of oropharyngeal
cancer and related search terms between 2004 and 2015.
RESULTS: In terms of NIH funding, 100 OPC-related projects representing 242 grant
years and $108.5 million were funded between 2004 and 2015. Total NIH funding for
OPC projects increased from $167,406 in 2004 to $16.2 million in 2015. Funding
for HPV-related OPC increased from less than $2 million yearly between 2004 and
2010 up to $12.7 million in 2015. Principal investigators related to radiation
oncology ($41.8 million) and with doctor of medicine degrees ($52.8 million)
received the largest share of total funding. Relative Internet search popularity 
for oropharyngeal cancer has increased from 2004 to 2015 compared to control
cancer search terms.
CONCLUSION: Increased public interest and NIH funding has paralleled the rising
incidence of OPC. NIH funding has been driven by projects related to the role of 
HPV in OPC.
