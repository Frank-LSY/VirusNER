BACKGROUND: Among head and neck cancers, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is 
associated with tonsillar carcinomas. Despite this, no HPV16-positive tonsillar
cancer cell line has been established in nude mice.
METHODS: Fresh tonsillar carcinoma biopsies were obtained from 23 patients and
implanted subcutaneously into nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu).
RESULTS: After 7 months, one xenograft was established. The primary tumor
harbored 2.7 copies (95% confidence interval = 2.4-2.9) of HPV16/cell and
displayed 99.9% (7904/7906) nucleotide identity to HPV16 (EU118173.1). The
xenograft showed increased methylation in two E2-binding sites of the HPV16
genome. Both episomal and integrated HPV16 were detected in the original tumor
and in 14 xenografts from the second passage. From this passage, a viral load of 
6.4 copies/cell (range = 4.6-9.6) and 3.7 (range = 1.0-5.5) E7-mRNA
transcripts/HPV16-genome were detected.
CONCLUSION: This xenograft represents the first established HPV16-positive
tonsillar tumor in nude mice and could provide an experimental system of
HPV16-positive tonsillar cancers.
