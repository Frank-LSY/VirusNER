A 69-year-old man with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis presented with fever. He tested positive for the QuantiFERON TB-2G and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 antibodies. Imaging revealed a mass in the neck of the gallbladder, with periportal lymph node enlargement and penetration into the duodenum. A definite diagnosis could not be made, even with a subsequent detailed examination. Finally, cholecystectomy and a lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathology revealed a caseating granuloma in the lymph nodes and in the serosa of the gallbladder, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for tuberculosis. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with abdominal tuberculosis lymphadenitis extending into the gallbladder and duodenum.
