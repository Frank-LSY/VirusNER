Head and neck cancers (HNC), 90% of which are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC),
rank sixth among all malignancies worldwide and comprise 40-50% of the total
number of malignancies in India. In addition to alcohol and tobacco usage, which 
is the major source of oral carcinogens, viruses such as human papilloma virus
(HPV) may also contribute to development of the malignancy. The aim of this study
was to identify the prevalence of HPV in head and neck cancers using material
from metastatic site. A total of 111 cases of neck nodal metastases were included
in this study. The primary was identified as oral cavity, oropharynx and
nasopharynx. In a subset, the primary remained "unknown." Polymerase chain
reaction was carried out to detect HPV DNA on the fine needle aspirates. HPV was 
detected in 32.4% cases. Maximum positivity was observed in metastases from
primary in the oral cavity (47.1%) with tongue (55%), followed by oropharynx
(25%) and nasopharynx (5%) cases. In the unknown primary group, HPV was detected 
in 52.9% cases. Study defines the association of HPV with HNC in population of
northern India. There was varied association of HPV depending on site of primary 
tumor arising in mucosal surfaces of head and neck region.
