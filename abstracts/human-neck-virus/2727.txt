BACKGROUND: Patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck region
(HNSCC) are at risk for disease recurrence and metastases, even after initial
successful therapy. A tissue-based biomarker could be beneficial to guide
treatment as well as post-treatment surveillance. Gene methylation status has
been recently identified as powerful prognostic biomarker in HNSCC. We therefore 
evaluated the methylation status of the homeobox gene PITX1 and the adjacent long
intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) C5orf66-AS1 in publicly available datasets.
METHODS: Gene methylation and expression data from 528 patients with HNSCC
included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, there obtained by using the Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit) were evaluated and methylation and expression
levels of PITX1 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 was correlated with overall survival and 
other parameters. Thus, ten beads targeting PITX1 exon 3 and three beads
targeting lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 were identified as significant candidates. The mean
methylation of these beads was used for further correlation and the median was
employed for dichotomization.
RESULTS: Both PITX1 exon 3 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 were significantly higher
methylated in tumor tissue than in normal adjacent tissue (NAT) (PITX1 exon 3:
tumor tissue 58.1%, NAT: 31.7%, p<0.001; lincRNA C5orf66-AS1: tumor tissue:
27.4%, NAT: 18.9%, p<0.001). In a univariate analysis, hypermethylation of both
loci was significantly associated with the risk of death (univariate: exon 3:
Hazard ratio (HR): 4.97 [1.78-16.71], p = 0.010, lincRNA C5orf66-AS1: Hazard
ratio (HR): 12.23 [3.01-49.74], p<0.001). PITX1 exon 3 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1
methylation was also significantly correlated with tumor localization, T
category, human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative and p16-negative tumors and tumor 
grade. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed, that lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 hypomethylation was
significantly associated with overall survival (p = 0.001) in the entire cohort
as well in a subgroup of HPV-negative tumors (p = 0.003) and in patients with
laryngeal tumors (p = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Methylation status of PITX1 and even more so of lincRNA C5orf66-AS1
is a promising prognostic biomarker in HNSCC, in particular for HPV-negative
patients. Further prospective evaluation is warranted.
