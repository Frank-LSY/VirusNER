Emergency medicine physicians are uniquely positioned to detect manifestations of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the head and neck region. Awareness
of the myriad of opportunistic infections and malignancies that involve the head,
neck, and eyes is paramount to their diagnosis and treatment. On occasion some of
these manifestations are a direct result of HIV and represent the initial signs
of primary HIV infection. In some cases, prompt diagnosis and therapy will lead
to preservation of function and prevention of significant morbidity.
