Thirty-four (76%) carcinomas were EBV-positive/HPV-negative, 7 (16%) were EBV-negative/HPV-negative, and 4 (9%) were EBV-negative/HPV-positive. HPV was more likely to be detected in carcinomas from white patients than non-white patients (16% vs 0%; p = .03). Of the 3 patients with HPV-positive carcinomas and available staging information, all were found to have extension into the oropharynx. All HPV-positive carcinomas were p16 positive, but none of the HPV-negative carcinomas were p16 positive (p < .001).
