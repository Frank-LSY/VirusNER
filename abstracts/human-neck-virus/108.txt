OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of limited head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas human papillomavirus(HPV) infection status on the prognosis in
different nationalities of Xinjiang.
METHODS: The clinical data of 149 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
from Uighur, Han and Kazak was analyzed. The HPV16/18 infection and viral load
was examined.The prognosis was analyzed by cox multiIvar-Iate model. The effect
of HPV infection status on prognosis was evaluated.
RESULTS: In this study, Oropharyngeal HPV infection rate was 35.0%, followed by
hypopharynx 30.0%, oropharyx was 16.0%. The overall survival rate of 3 years and 
5 years was 66.4%, and 39.2% respectively. The clinical stage,N stage and HPV
were influencing factors for the prognosis of patients with head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (P< 0.05). N stage and HPV were independent prognostic
factors for the prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(P< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of HPV infection in oropharynx in head and neck
cancer. HPV positive is a protective factor for the prognosis of head and neck
cancer, and the risk of death in patients with HPV was 3/5 lower than that of HPV
negative patients. HPV viral load may be positively related to the total survival
rate. N stage is a risk factor for the prognosis of head and neck cancer.
Different nationalities have little influence on prognosis.
