BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus-16 (HPV-16) infection is a major risk factor
for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), in particular
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Current techniques for assessing
the HPV-16 status in HNSCC include the detection of HPV-16 DNA and p16(INK4a)
expression in tumor tissues. When tumors originate from hidden anatomical sites, 
this method can be challenging. A non-invasive and cost-effective alternative to 
biopsy is therefore desirable for HPV-16 detection especially within a community 
setting to screen at-risk individuals.
METHODS: The present study compared detection of HPV-16 DNA and RNA in salivary
oral rinses with tumor p16(INK4a) status, in 82 HNSCC patients using end-point
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Of 42 patients with p16(INK4a)-positive tumours, 39 (sensitivity = 92.9 
%, PPV = 100 % and NPV = 93 %) had oral rinse samples with detectable HPV-16 DNA,
using end-point and quantitative PCR. No HPV-16 DNA was detected in oral rinse
samples from 40 patients with p16(INK4a) negative tumours, yielding a test
specificity of 100 %. For patients with p16(INK4a) positive tumours, HPV-16 mRNA 
was detected using end-point reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 24/40
(sensitivity = 60 %, PPV = 100 % and NPV = 71 %), and using quantitative RT-PCR
in 22/40 (sensitivity = 55 %, PPV = 100 % and NPV = 69 %). No HPV-16 mRNA was
detected in oral rinse samples from the p16(INK4a)-negative patients, yielding a 
specificity of 100 %.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the detection of HPV-16 DNA in salivary oral
rinse is indicative of HPV status in HNSCC patients and can potentially be used
as a diagnostic tool in addition to the current methods.
