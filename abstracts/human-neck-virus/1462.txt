OBJECTIVES: (1) Investigate oncologic survival outcomes and (2) analyze the
impact of human papillomavirus status on prognosis in patients with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma treated with transoral robotic versus open surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care referral center, University of Alabama at Birmingham
Hospital.
SUBJECTS: One hundred thirty total (65 per treatment arm) with primary
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
METHODS: Patients treated for primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with 
either transoral robotic (TORS) or open surgery plus standard of care adjuvant
therapy between October 2004 and March 2012 were matched based on TNM staging
before a retrospective chart review was performed. Carcinoma tissue was stained
both prospectively and retrospectively with CINtec p16-INK4a kits for surrogate
human papillomavirus typing. Recurrence-free survival was used to evaluate the
impact of human papillomavirus tumor status and method of surgical intervention
on prognosis.
RESULTS: As a whole, patients treated with transoral robotic surgery survived
more frequently (94%, 91%, 89% at 1, 2, 3 years, respectively) than those treated
with open surgery (85%, 75%, 73% at 1, 2, 3 years, correspondingly) (P = .035).
The subgroup of patients with human papillomavirus-negative malignancies treated 
with open surgery survived without recurrence less frequently at 1, 2, and 3 year
rates of 58%, 25%, 25%, respectively (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: These retrospective data suggest that oncologic outcomes are not
being sacrificed when patients with OPSCC are treated with TORS instead of open
surgery regardless of tumor human papillomavirus immunohistochemical staining.
