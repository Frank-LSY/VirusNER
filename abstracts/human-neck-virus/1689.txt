OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have found that cases with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) positive for HPV16 genotype have better overall survival
compared with cases positive for other HPV genotypes. We sought to further
replicate these studies and determine if this relationship is modified by
expression of p16 tumor suppressor protein.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified 238 OPSCC cases from the Carolina Head and
Neck Cancer Study (CHANCE) study, a population based case-control study. Tumors
that tested positive solely for HPV16 genotype and no other genotypes with PCR
were classified as HPV16-positive. Tumors positive for any other high-risk HPV
genotype were classified as non-HPV16-positive. Expression of p16 in the tumor
was determined with immunohistochemistry. Follow-up time was calculated from the 
date of diagnosis to date of death or December 31, 2013. Overall survival was
compared with the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR)
adjusted for smoking, alcohol use, sex, race, and age was calculated with the Cox
proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: Cases with HPV16-positive OPSCC had better overall survival than cases
with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC (log-rank p-value: 0.010). When restricted to OPSCC
cases positive for p16 expression, the same trend continued (log-rank p-value:
0.002). In the adjusted model, cases with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC had greater
risk of death compared to cases with HPV16-positive tumors (HR: 1.92; 95% CI:
1.03, 3.60).
CONCLUSIONS: This finding indicates that HPV genotyping carries valuable
prognostic significance in addition to p16 status and future survival studies of 
OPSCC should take into account differing HPV genotypes.
