Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), accounting for more than 80% in
head and neck malignancies, kills thousands of people a year in the world.
Despite most of the patients are more than 45, and the occurrences of head and
neck cancer shows a decreasing trend; however, horribly, the incidences of the
patients under 45 years old is steadily increasing. Hence, it's of vital
importance to get more pathogen information about risk factors of HNSCC in
children and young adults. This review outlines the etiologic spectrum of HNSCC, 
especially oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, in patients under 45 years
of age.
