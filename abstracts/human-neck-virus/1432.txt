PURPOSE: This study was designed to find a reliable Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
immunoglobulin (Ig) G-based diagnostic/screening test for nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) able to demarcate between the NPC-related seropositivity of EBV
IgG antibodies and that of other head and neck cancer (HNCA) and control groups. 
The NPC-associated immunosuppression affects EBV IgA much more than IgG, leading 
to inconsistent detection of NPC using EBV IgA antibodies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-two HNCA patients, 42 NPC, 66 laryngeal
carcinoma, and 14 hypopharyngeal carcinoma and 3 groups of 100 control subjects
were enrolled in this study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used
to find a specific cutoff value for the NPC-related seropositivity of EBV IgG
antibodies.
RESULTS: NPC group showed higher serum level of EBV IgG antibodies than control
and other HNCA groups (P < .05). However, the traditional cutoff value, mean + 2 
SDs of control subjects, failed to demarcate the seropositives of NPC patients
from those of healthy population (P > .05). The new cutoff value, mean + 2 SDs of
the seropositives group of control subjects who had already been grouped by the
traditional cutoff value, proved successful. It succeeded to demarcate between
the NPC-related EBV IgG seropositivity and that issued from the persistent,
latent, or reactivated EBV infection in the population (P < .05). The
sensitivity/specificity of NPC detection by the new cutoff-based ELISA kit,
76.19% and 86%, was close or higher than that of EBV IgA antibodies.
CONCLUSION: EBV IgG-based ELISA could be used for the diagnosis of NPC using a
new cutoff threshold that excludes the population baseline of EBV IgG
seropositivity.
