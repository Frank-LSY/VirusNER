PURPOSE: Initial deescalation studies for human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive
driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPV+ OPSCC) altered radiation
therapy dose or the systemic agent used. Newer trials examine the disease control
achieved with a reduced elective nodal field. We examined patterns of nodal
involvement in patients with HPV+ OPSCC with a focus on implications for
radiation field design for treatment deescalation.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records of patients with HPV+ OPSCC with preoperative
imaging (computed tomography or fludeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography/computed tomography) who underwent neck dissection without neoadjuvant
therapy from 2010 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The number and location 
of clinically positive lymph nodes on preoperative imaging were compared with
those documented on pathology. These data were then used to establish the
probability of missing nodal disease in 3 modified radiation field designs.
RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. The median time between imaging and 
surgery was 22 days. The most common clinical N stage was cN2a (35%), whereas the
most common pathologic N stage was pN2b (45%). The median number of
radiographically and pathologically involved nodes was 1 (range, 0-6) and 2
(range, 0-11), respectively. Forty-three percent of patients had more
pathologically involved nodes than predicted on imaging, whereas 21% had
pathologic involvement at an additional nodal level not predicted on imaging. Of 
the 21 patients with additional pathologically involved nodal levels, 14 had
involvement of a directly adjacent station, 4 were patients with a cN0 hemineck
with pathologically positive level II disease, and 3 had pathologic involvement
of level 2 echelons removed from that predicted on imaging.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that radiation fields encompassing only clinically
involved nodes or levels has an unacceptably high likelihood of missing
subclinical disease. Alternatively, treating the first uninvolved echelon nodes
in addition would cover pathologic sites of disease in 97% of patients. This
approach merits further study in prospective trials.
