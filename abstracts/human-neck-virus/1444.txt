BACKGROUND: A 17-year-old boy on long-term immunosuppression following renal
transplantation for chronic kidney disease (CKD), the result of dysplastic
kidneys, initially presented with a swelling in his neck while attending hospital
for an unrelated problem. A clinical diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and he
was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Over a few days, his condition
deteriorated, and he developed multiple vesicopustular skin lesions and required 
an emergency tonsillectomy due to respiratory distress.
CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Histological investigation of the skin and tonsillar
tissue suggested a viral aetiology, and subsequent electron microscopy and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tissue examination proved disseminated cowpox
infection. The family cat, which was reported as having self-resolving sores on
its skin, was likely the source of the infection. The child failed to respond to 
antiviral treatment and succumbed to multiorgan failure within a month of
admission.
CONCLUSIONS: We report this case of fatal disseminated cowpox infection to
highlight an increasing risk of this illness in the post-transplant population
and to detail some unusual features not previously described, such as tonsillar
involvement, disseminated skin lesions and multiorgan failure.
