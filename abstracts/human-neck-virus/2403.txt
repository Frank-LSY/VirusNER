Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCHN) arise in the mucosa of the upper
aerodigestive tract at multiple anatomic sites. While tobacco and alcohol
exposure remain the primary risk factors for this malignancy, infection with the 
human papilloma virus is emerging as a major contributing factor to cancers that 
arise primarily in the oropharynx. Despite therapeutic advances, survival has
remained relatively unchanged over the past few decades. Increased understand of 
the cellular and molecular biology of these cancers will improve our
understanding of this malignancy and facilitate the development of more effective
therapeutic strategies. Alterations that have been studied to date include
genetic and epigenetic changes. While the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
is the only established molecular therapeutic target, other proteins and pathways
are under active investigation to determine their contribution to SCCHN
carcinogenesis and progression.
