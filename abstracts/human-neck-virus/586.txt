OPINION STATEMENT: Oropharyngeal cancer has demonstrated a steady increase in
incidence over the past 20 years in contrast to declining numbers of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) overall. Recent evidence has found that
high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the likely cause of the
changing epidemiology of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV-associated oropharyngeal
cancer has a molecular, epidemiological, and clinical profile that is distinct
from non-HPV HNSCC. Clinicians managing oropharyngeal HNSCC need to be aware of
differences in the HPV HNSCC population which may impact treatment outcomes.
Testing of HNSCC tumor tissue for HPV using validated and precise techniques
should be performed when feasible.
