The evidence that human papillomavirus infection is related to head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma is supported by molecular and epidemiological data. The
definition of a distinct subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
independent of the traditional risk factors and with different clinical
presentation and outcome, has led to increasing interest in human papillomavirus 
infection. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding human
papillomavirus biology, oncogenic mechanisms, risk factors for transmission,
clinical significance and prophylactic strategies.
