PURPOSE: The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of HPV-associated epithelial cancers are in
principle ideal immunotherapeutic targets, but evidence that T cells specific for
these antigens can recognize and kill HPV(+) tumor cells is limited. We sought to
determine whether TCR gene engineered T cells directed against an HPV oncoprotein
can successfully target HPV(+) tumor cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: T-cell responses against the HPV-16 oncoproteins were
investigated in a patient with an ongoing 22-month disease-free interval after
her second resection of distant metastatic anal cancer. T cells genetically
engineered to express an oncoprotein-specific TCR from this patient's
tumor-infiltrating T cells were tested for specific reactivity against HPV(+)
epithelial tumor cells.
RESULTS: We identified, from an excised metastatic anal cancer tumor, T cells
that recognized an HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitope of HPV-16 E6. The frequency of 
the dominant T-cell clonotype from these cells was approximately 400-fold greater
in the patient's tumor than in her peripheral blood. T cells genetically
engineered to express the TCR from this clonotype displayed high avidity for an
HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitope of HPV-16, and they showed specific recognition
and killing of HPV-16(+) cervical, and head and neck cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that HPV-16(+) tumors can be targeted by 
E6-specific TCR gene engineered T cells, and they provide the foundation for a
novel cellular therapy directed against HPV-16(+) malignancies, including
cervical, oropharyngeal, anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers.
