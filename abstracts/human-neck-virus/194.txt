BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most
common cancer worldwide. Existing therapies for advanced tumors have high failure
rates and can have severe consequences in terms of pain, disfigurement, and poor 
speech and swallowing function. New treatment strategies are needed to improve
outcomes for patients suffering with this disease and oncolytic viruses represent
a promising approach.
METHODS: We infected six well-characterized HNSCC cell lines (Cal27, Detroit562, 
FaDu, SCC4, SCC15, SCC25), with increasing doses of a panel of poxviruses
(including myxoma, vaccinia, raccoonpox and tanapox viruses) modified to express 
green fluorescence protein to determine which virus was the most effective
oncolytic agent in cell-based assays.
RESULTS: While myxoma, raccoonpox and tanapox displayed differing efficacy in the
panel of cell lines, vaccinia virus was the most potent of the tested poxviruses 
and was highly effective in controlling cell growth in all cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Oncolytic poxviruses, particularly vaccinia virus, were effective in 
killing HNSCC in vitro and hold promise as potential treatments for patients with
HNSCC.
