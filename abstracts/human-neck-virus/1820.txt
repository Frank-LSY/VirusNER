BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This report contains the mature five-year data from the
Swedish ARTSCAN trial including information on the influence of p16 positivity
(p16+) for oropharyngeal cancers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma 
without distant metastases of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx (except T1-2,
N0 glottic cancers) and hypopharynx were included. Patients were randomised
between accelerated fractionation (AF) (1.1Gy+2Gy per day, 5days/week for
4.5weeks, total dose 68Gy) and conventional fractionation (CF) (2Gy per day,
5days/week for 7weeks, total dose 68Gy). Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
p16-expression was assessed retrospectively in tumour tissues from patients with 
oropharyngeal carcinoma.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in loco-regional control (LRC)
between AF and CF (log-rank test p=0.75). LRC at 5years was 65.5% for AF and
64.9% for CF. Overall survival (OS) was similar in both arms (p=0.99). The
estimated cancer specific survival (CSS) at 5years was 62.2% (AF) and 63.3% (CF) 
(p=0.99). 206 specimens were analysed for p16 with 153 specimens (74%) identified
as p16+. P16 status did not discriminate for response to AF vs. CF with regard to
LRC, OS or CSS. Patients with p16+ tumours had a statistically significant better
overall prognosis compared with p16- tumours.
CONCLUSION: This update confirms the results of the 2-year report. We failed to
identify a positive effect resulting from AF with regards to LRC, OS and CSS. The
addition of information on the HPV-associated p16 overexpression did not explain 
this lack of effect.
