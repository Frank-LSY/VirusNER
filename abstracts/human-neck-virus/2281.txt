Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody, approved to treat patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for years. It functions by blocking
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from receiving signals or interacting
with other proteins. Although the demand for cetuximab for the treatment of
cancer patients in clinics is increasing, the complicated techniques involved and
its high cost limit its wide applications. Here, a new, cheaper form of cetuximab
was generated for cancer gene therapy. This was achieved by cloning the
full-length cetuximab antibody into two serotypes of adenoviral vectors, termed
as AdC68-CTB and Hu5-CTB. In vivo studies showed that a single dose of AdC68-CTB 
or Hu5-CTB induced sustained cetuximab expression and dramatically suppressed
tumor growth in NCI-H508- or DiFi-inoculated nude mice. In conclusion, gene
therapy using adenovirus expressing full-length cetuximab could be a novel
alternative method for the effective treatment of colorectal cancer.
