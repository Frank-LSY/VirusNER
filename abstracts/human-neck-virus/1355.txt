OBJECTIVES: Hypopharyngeal cancer is a subset of head neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) with particularly poor prognosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is
a risk factor for some HNSCC, and its presence is of prognostic value for certain
subsites. However, its influence on survival in hypopharyngeal cancer has not
been thoroughly investigated. Here we examine HPV DNA and p16(INK4a) (p16)
overexpression in relation to clinical outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hypopharyngeal tumour biopsies from 82 patients diagnosed 
2008-2013 were examined for presence of HPV DNA by a bead-based multiplex assay
and for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry, and the obtained data compared to
that acquired previously from 109 patients diagnosed 2000-2007 at the same
clinic. A survival analysis was then performed on 142 patients (from both
studies) treated with curative intent and a 3-year follow-up time.
RESULTS: Of the tumour biopsies 3/82 (3.7%) were HPV16 DNA and p16 positive,
while 12/82 (14.6%) were p16 positive, equivalent to that in the previous study. 
Overall 3-year survival was significantly more favourable for patients with HPV16
DNA and p16 positive tumours as compared to survival of the other patients (86%
vs. 31%, p=0.0185). A similar but not statistically significant trend was found
for disease specific survival.
CONCLUSION: HPV DNA and p16 positive hypopharyngeal cancer was rare and had not
increased, but had a better clinical outcome as compared to other HPV-unrelated
hypopharyngeal cancer. In addition, p16 overexpression was not a suitable
surrogate marker for presence of HPV or for prediction of survival in this type
of cancer.
