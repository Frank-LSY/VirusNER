INTRODUCTION: While previous studies have noted that hypogonadism (HG) may pose a
significant economic and quality-of-life burden, no studies have evaluated the
impact of HG on healthcare utilization and costs in the United States.
AIM: Compare direct (health care) and indirect (disability leave or medical
absence) costs between privately insured U.S. employees with HG and controls
without HG.
METHODS: The study sample included 4,269 male employees, ages 35-64, with ≥ 2 HG 
diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification: 257.2x) or ≥ 1 HG diagnosis and ≥ 1 claim for testosterone therapy,
1/1/2005-3/31/2009, identified from a large, private insurance administrative
database that includes medical, prescription drug, and disability claims data.
The index date was the most recent HG diagnosis that had continuous eligibility
for at least 1 year before (baseline period) and 1 year after (study period).
Employees with HG were matched 1:1 on age, region, salaried vs. nonsalaried
employment status, and index year to controls without HG.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive analyses compared demographic characteristics,
comorbidities, resource utilization, direct and indirect costs inflated to USD
2009. Multivariate analyses adjusting for baseline characteristics were used to
estimate risk-adjusted costs.
RESULTS: HG employees and controls had a mean age of 51 years. HG employees
compared with controls had higher baseline comorbidity rates, including
hyperlipidemia (50.2% vs. 25.3%), hypertension (37.7% vs. 21.1%), back/neck pain 
(32.0% vs. 15.7%), and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (7.1% vs. 0.3%) (all P < 0.0001). HG employees had higher mean study
period direct ($10,914 vs. $3,823) and indirect costs ($3,204 vs. $1,450);
HG-related direct costs were $832 (all P < 0.0001). Risk-adjusted direct ($9,291 
vs. $5,248) and indirect ($2,729 vs. $1,840) costs were also higher for HG
employees (all P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Employees with HG had higher comorbidity rates and costs compared
with controls. Given the low HG-related costs, a primary driver of costs among HG
patients appears to be their comorbidity burden.
