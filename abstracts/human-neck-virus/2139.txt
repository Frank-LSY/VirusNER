BACKGROUND: Although smoking and HPV infection are recognized as important risk
factors for oropharyngeal cancer, how their joint exposure impacts on
oropharyngeal cancer risk is unclear. Specifically, whether smoking confers any
additional risk to HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is not understood.
METHODS: Using HPV serology as a marker of HPV-related cancer, we examined the
interaction between smoking and HPV16 in 459 oropharyngeal (and 1445 oral cavity 
and laryngeal) cancer patients and 3024 control participants from two large
European multi-centre studies. Odds ratios and credible intervals [CrI], adjusted
for potential confounders, were estimated using Bayesian logistic regression.
RESULTS: Both smoking [odds ratio (OR [CrI]: 6.82 [4.52, 10.29]) and HPV
seropositivity (OR [CrI]: 235.69 [99.95, 555.74]) were independently associated
with oropharyngeal cancer. The joint association of smoking and HPV
seropositivity was consistent with that expected on the additive scale (synergy
index [CrI]: 1.32 [0.51, 3.45]), suggesting they act as independent risk factors 
for oropharyngeal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking was consistently associated with increase in oropharyngeal
cancer risk in models stratified by HPV16 seropositivity. In addition, we report 
that the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer increases with smoking for both
HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative persons. The impact of smoking on
HPV16-positive oropharyngeal cancer highlights the continued need for smoking
cessation programmes for primary prevention of head and neck cancer.
