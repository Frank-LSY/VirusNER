Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly malignant and frequently metastasized 
tumor, and the prognosis is very poor when distant metastases occur. Recently,
immunotherapy is becoming a promising therapeutic approach. Interferon-α (IFN-α) 
represents the cytokines exhibiting the longest record of use in clinical
oncology. In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of IFN-α1b on NPC. The
results showed that recombinant human IFN-α1b (hIFN-α1b) suppressed cell growth, 
induced a G1-phase cell cycle arrest in vitro, increased the expression of p16
and pRb, and decreased the expression of CCND1 and CDK6. In vivo analyses showed 
that either recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-IFN-α1b or hIFN-α1b
treatment inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, reduced intratumoral microvessel
density, increased cell apoptosis and necrosis, and induced prolonged survival.
Notably, rAAV-IFN-α1b or hIFN-α1b treatment led to significantly higher serum
levels of IL-12 and GM-CSF in mice compared to respective controls. Our findings 
suggest that IFN-α1b acts as a multifunctional antitumor agent in NPC, which may 
have important therapeutic implications.
