OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the co-prevalence of cervical
and oropharyngeal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in patients with
HPV-related high-grade disease of the uterine cervix (high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, women with abnormal
cervical cytology admitted to our colposcopy units received HPV testing of the
uterine cervix and the oropharynx via smear. From a subset of patients, oral
lavage was collected to compare detection rates of HPV DNA between lavage and
swab. Patients with confirmed high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)-positive HSIL of the cervix 
were further investigated. Sexual behavior and lifestyle factors were documented 
with a standardized questionnaire.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five women were included in the study. Of the 235
women, 135 (57.5%) were cervically HR-HPV positive with histologically confirmed 
high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesion (median [range] age = 30 [21-45]
years). Of these, only 6 (4.4%) also had a positive oral specimen. In 3 (50%) of 
the 6 cases, the same HPV type was detected in oral and cervical samples (HPV 16,
35, and 45). Oral HPV detection was not higher when combining swab and lavage
compared with swab alone. A relation between sexual behavior and oral HPV
detection could not be demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral HPV prevalence in women with cervical HPV infection and HSIL is
low. Simultaneous testing of oropharyngeal and cervical HPV infection does not
seem promising as future screening strategy.
