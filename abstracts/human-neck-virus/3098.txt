Disinfection of the face and mucosa lined surfaces of the nose and mouth using a 
povidone-iodine (PI) or Betadine solution is common practice among head and neck 
surgeons. Povidone-iodine, which is a highly effective broad-spectrum antibiotic 
effective against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, decreases the risk of
postoperative surgical wound infection. We report a case of PI aspiration causing
an acute chemical pneumonitis after preoperative disinfection of the oral cavity 
and nasopharynx in preparation for cleft palate repair. As a result of the
inflammatory response, the patient required positive pressure mechanical
ventilation and a prolonged stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The
patient was safely extubated on hospital day 7 and discharged on hospital day 10 
without any long-term sequelae on follow-up. We also review the 3 other reported 
cases of PI aspiration pneumonitis. Based on our case report and literature
review, we conclude that PI aspiration is associated with a high rate of
morbidity; however, this should not preclude the use of PI before surgery, given 
its effectiveness as an oral disinfectant and the exceedingly low incidence of
aspiration.
