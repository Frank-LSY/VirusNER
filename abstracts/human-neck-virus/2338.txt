Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are well known causes of anogenital
cancers. Recent studies show that HPV also plays a role in oropharyngeal cancer
(OPC). A review on the role of HPV vaccination in the prevention of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with special emphasis on OPC was conducted and
available vaccines and vaccination strategies in HNSCC and OPC are discussed.
Prophylactic vaccination is known to be effective for prevention of anogenital
HPV infection and precursor lesions in the cervix and anus. While the value of
vaccination for prevention of OPC and possibly as an adjuvant treatment is still 
an open question, evidence to date supports the possibility that HPV vaccination 
may prove to be effective in reducing the incidence of this malignancy.
