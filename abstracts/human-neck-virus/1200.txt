Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is a major cause of cervical cancer. We
previously demonstrated that C-to-T and G-to-A hypermutations accumulated in the 
HPV16 genome by APOBEC3 expression in vitro. To investigate in vivo
characteristics of hypermutation, differential DNA denaturation-PCR (3D-PCR) was 
performed using three clinical specimens obtained from HPV16-positive cervical
dysplasia, and detected hypermutation from two out of three specimens. One sample
accumulating hypermutations in both E2 and the long control region (LCR) was
further subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing, revealing that hypermutations
spread across the LCR and all early genes. Notably, hypermutation was more
frequently observed in the LCR, which contains a viral replication origin and the
early promoter. APOBEC3 expressed abundantly in an HPV16-positive cervix,
suggesting that single-stranded DNA exposed during viral replication and
transcription may be efficient targets for deamination. The results further
strengthen a role of APOBEC3 in introducing HPV16 hypermutation in vivo.
