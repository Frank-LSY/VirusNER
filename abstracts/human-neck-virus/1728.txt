The initiation and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
and other cancers have recently been related to the presence of cancer stem cells
(CSC). CSC are cancer initiating, sustaining and are mostly quiescent. Specific
markers that vary considerably depending on tumor type or tissue of origin
characterize putative CSC. Compared to the bulk tumor mass, CSC are less
sensitive to chemo- and radiotherapy and may also have low immunogenicity.
Therapeutic targeting of CSC may improve clinical outcome of HNSCC which has two 
distinct etiologies: infection of epithelial stem cells by high-risk types of the
human papillomavirus, or long-term tobacco and alcohol abuse. Recent knowledge on
the role of CSC in HNSCC is reviewed and where necessary parallels to CSC of
other origin are drawn to give a more comprehensive picture.
