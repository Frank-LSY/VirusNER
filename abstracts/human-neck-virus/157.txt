OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven disease
beyond the oropharynx varies greatly in the reported literature.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one samples were strictly classified to the subsites 
of oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx at the time of primary surgery.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were subjected to a validated, tiered,
diagnostic algorithm of p16 immunohistochemistry, high-risk HPV in situ
hybridization, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for HPV E6 DNA. An
additional 60 oropharyngeal cases acted as an internal biological control.
RESULTS: An incidence of 4% of HPV-driven cases was observed across the subsites 
outside the oropharynx compared to 70% of tumors confined within it.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reporting of a broad range of nonoropharyngeal HPV
rates using this validated diagnostic algorithm. It remains unclear whether
patients with HPV-driven disease originating outside the oropharynx enjoy the
same survival advantage apparent in those patients with oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinomas.
