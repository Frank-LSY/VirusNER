It is not just IMRT: Human papillomavirus related oropharynx squamous cell
carcinoma is associated with better swallowing outcomes after definitive
chemoradiotherapy.

OBJECTIVES: Long term swallowing dysfunction in patients with oropharynx squamous
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) is declining.
While the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is commonly believed to 
be a potential cause, we hypothesize that the increasing incidence of human
papillomavirus (HPV) related disease may also favorably impact this outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 130 HPV+ and 17 HPV- patients with stage
III-IV OPSCC treated exclusively with conventional 3-field radiotherapy with
chemotherapy between 2002 and 2010. The rates of normal diet, limited diet
(significant restrictions in the types of foods eaten, and/or requiring
nutritional supplementation for weight maintenance) and feeding tube dependence
(FTD) were compared between HPV+ and HPV- patients. Cox proportional hazards
modeling were used to perform univariate analysis (UVA) to examine predictors of 
a combined endpoint of dietary limitation, which included limited diet and/or
FTD. These outcomes were also compared to our previously reported cohort of OPSCC
patients treated between 1989 and 2002 to assess changes in toxicity over time
given the changing disease epidemiology, in the setting of identical treatment
regimens.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 55 months, HPV+ patients more frequently had 
resumed a normal diet (87% vs. 65%) at last follow up and had lower rates of
limited diet (9% vs. 18%) and FTD (4% vs. 18%) compared to HPV- patients
(p=0.02). HPV status was the only significant predictor of reduced swallowing
dysfunction on UVA (HR 0.19; p=0.008). When compared to our 1989-2002 cohort,
patients treated between 2002 and 2010 had less FTD (7.5% vs. 34%, p<0.001) and
dietary limitations (26% vs.46%, p<0.001) at 6 months post treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV+ patients with OPSCC have reduced late swallowing dysfunction
after chemoradiation compared to HPV- patients. The changing epidemiology of
OPSCC may play a role in toxicity reduction in these patients, independent of the
increasing use of IMRT.
