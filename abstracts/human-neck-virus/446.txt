High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the development of a subset of head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs), especially those arising from the lingual or palatine tonsils. HPV-associated HNSCCs represent a different disease entity from those associated with the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use. The demonstration that HPV is causally associated with a subset of HNSCC has tremendous clinical and research implications.
