A 50-year-old man, a known case of human immunodeficiency virus infection for the
past 1 year, was on antiretroviral therapy in the form of stavudine, lamivudine, 
and nevirapine. Three days after replacing stavudine with tenofovir, he developed
redness on the face and neck and within 48 h the rash became generalized.
Dermatological examination revealed involvement of photoexposed areas of the face
in the form of erythema and ill-defined hyperpigmented plaques, with mild
periorbital edema. There was specific involvement of V and nape of the neck.
Extensive erythema and scaling were also present on buttocks, thighs, and upper
third of legs. A diagnosis of photoallergic dermatitis to tenofovir was
considered and confirmed by histopathology and photopatch test. He responded well
to the stoppage of the drug and oral corticosteroids. This is the first report of
a photoallergic reaction to tenofovir in the literature.
