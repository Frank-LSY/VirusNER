OBJECTIVE: Oncolytic forms of attenuated Vaccinia virus are now in clinical
development, assessing the compatibility of this novel treatment with
radiotherapy may reveal exploitable synergistic relationships.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro analyses of cell killing, cell cycle effects and 
caspase activation were carried out on HN3, HN5, CAL27, Detroit, SIHN5B, and PJ41
cells. In vivo studies of the virus and X-radiation were performed on H&N
xenografts in CD1 nude mice.
RESULTS: Cell killing in vitro was demonstrated to be dose- and time-dependent.
Infection causes an increase in S-phase and sub-G1 cells. A dose dependent
increase in active caspase-3 indicated induction of apoptosis. Xenografts
injected with Vaccinia stabilised and frequently completely regressed.
Combination with radiation generated additional cell death, induction of caspase 
activity and in vivo further improved long term regression rates.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support continued exploration of this therapy combination
and indicates potential for clinical trials in head and neck cancer.
