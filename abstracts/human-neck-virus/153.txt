The incidence of head and neck cancer remains high and is associated with many
deaths in both Western and Asian countries. Common risk factors in head and neck 
carcinoma are smoking and alcohol abuse, however, in an increasing proportion of 
cases, no significant smoking or drinking history has been reported. The
infectious nature of oncogenic viruses sets them apart from other carcinogenic
agents. As such, a thorough study of both the pathogenesis of viral infection and
the host response is crucial to a full understanding of the resulting cancers.
Such an understanding, in turn, has increased our knowledge of cellular pathways 
involved in growth and differentiation and neoplasia as a whole. Even though
human oncogenic viruses belong to different virus families and utilize diverse
strategies to contribute to cancer development, they share many common features. 
Viruses linked to cancers in humans are the human papilloma viruses, Epstein-Barr
virus, hepatitis C virus and human herpesvirus-8. The potential role and
involvement of these viruses in head and neck cancers along with brief
description of vaccine development is provided.
