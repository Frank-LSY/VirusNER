Much of the current literature regarding the molecular pathophysiology of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has focused
on the virus's effect on cell cycle modulation and cell proliferation. A second
mechanism of pathogenicity employed by HPV, dysregulation of cellular DNA repair 
processes, has been more sparsely studied. The purpose of this review is to
describe current understanding about the effect of HPV on DNA repair in HNSCC,
taking cues from cervical cancer literature. HPV affects DNA-damage response
pathways by interacting with many proteins, including ATM, ATR, MRN, γ-H2AX,
Chk1, Chk2, p53, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, Rb-related proteins 107 and 130, Tip60, and
p16INK4A. Further elucidation of these pathways could lead to development of
targeted therapies and improvement of current treatment protocols.
