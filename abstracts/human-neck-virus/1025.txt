BACKGROUND: Although human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) tends to present at an advanced nodal stage (N stage), the
prognosis is generally better than that for HPV-negative OPSCC. Prior work has
demonstrated the increasing incidence of HPV-related OPSCC in the United States. 
This study was designed to determine whether the changing epidemiology of OPSCC
is reflected in changes in the prognostic significance of the tumor stage (T
stage) and the N stage in a population-based cohort.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to
identify 13,328 patients who were 18 years old or older and were diagnosed with
OPSCC from 1997 to 2008. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate head and
neck cancer-specific survival. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
evaluate the associations between head and neck cancer-specific mortality (HNCSM)
and T and N stages and the interaction of variables with the year of diagnosis.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 67 months, there were 4099 head and neck
cancer deaths. There was a significant interaction between the T stage and time
(P for interaction = .01), with the effect of the T stage on HNCSM increasing
from 1997 to 2008. The T stage retained a linear relationship with HNCSM. The
effect of the N stage on HNCSM declined over time (P for interaction = .0004).
The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system did not
subdivide distinct prognostic subgroups for HNCSM by overall stage.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of OPSCC, the effect of the N stage
on cancer-specific mortality decreased over time as the impact of the T stage
increased. The current AJCC staging system did not distinguish prognostic
subgroups. These changes may reflect the increasing prevalence of HPV-related
OPSCC. Further study in HPV-defined cohorts is needed to tailor the AJCC staging 
system to better reflect HNCSM risk. Cancer 2015;121:2594-2602. © 2015 American
