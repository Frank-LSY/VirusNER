Chronic pharyngitis, a common inflammation of the pharyngeal mucosa, is often
caused by bacteria, viruses, alcohol abuse, overuse of the voice and cigarettes. 
This study aimed to explore the effects of polysaccharides of Citrus grandis L.
Osbeck (PCG) in relieving chronic pharyngitis and illustrate the underlying
mechanisms. Polysaccharides were obtained from PCG by column chromatographic
extraction. Six clinical symptom scores, such as the severity of itchy throat,
hoarseness, pain, odynophagia, cough and otalgia were evaluated in chronic
pharyngitis patients after the oral intake of PCG. The effects of polysaccharides
on chronic pharyngitis were investigated in ammonia-stimulated rabbits through
pathology analysis. The levels of inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood T 
cells were analyzed by ELISA. The total and phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2, JNK 
and p38 were assessed by Western blot. Protein amount of IKKα and p65, IKKα/β
activity and p65 activity were evaluated by Western blot and luciferase assay.
The clinical studies presented that PCG significantly relieved the six symptoms
of chronic pharyngitis patients. Pathology analysis of chronic pharyngitis
animals showed that the PCG treatment groups showed a significant decrease in the
number of pathologic cells and the reduction of pathologic cells was
dose-dependent (p < 0.01). ELISA analysis showed that PCG significantly inhibited
the αCD3-induced increase of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 expression in a dose-dependent 
manner. Moreover, Western blot and luciferase assay suggested that the
phosphorylation of IKKα/β in peripheral blood T cells was inhibited by the
administration of PCG. These results indicate that polysaccharides exhibit
anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKs, subsequently
suppressing the NF-κB pathway activation and decreasing the expression of
inflammatory mediators.
