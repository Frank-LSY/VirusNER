OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine vaccination practices of pediatric
gastroenterologists, as well as barriers to following immunization guidelines in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: Institutions listed in the North American Society for Pediatric
Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition clinical research registry and/or
ImproveCareNow were contacted. A total of 657 physicians from 129 institutions
were asked to complete a 16-question electronic survey.
RESULTS: A total of 178 physicians (27.1%) responded, of whom 55% were male and
83.1% practiced in an academic setting. A total of 11 physicians (6.2%) do not
routinely assess vaccination status, whereas 63.5% assess at the time of
diagnosis, 29.8% at "well" visits, and 44.4% before initiating immunosuppression.
At diagnosis, 51.1% verbally inquire about immunization status, 30.9% obtain
records, and 9.0% obtain serology.The influenza (78%), hepatitis B (84%), and
varicella (82%) vaccines were most frequently assessed. Fewer than 55.5% of
physicians reviewed other vaccines. Physicians using a reminder mechanism were
more likely to review immunizations at established visits (41.1% vs 20.8%), and
before transfer to an adult gastroenterologist (14.4% vs 2.6%). Lack of
coordination of care with primary care practitioners (41%), poor access to
immunization records (36%), and inability to offer vaccinations in their
immediate area (55%) are barriers to vaccination. Only 28% believed that primary 
care practitioners were solely responsible for immunizations.
CONCLUSIONS: There is practice variation among pediatric gastroenterologists in
assessment of immunizations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
including the specific vaccines assessed, and timing and method of assessment.
Inability to coordinate care, access immunization records, and offer vaccines
through their medical practice are barriers to adhering to immunization
guidelines.
