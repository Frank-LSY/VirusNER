BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers (HNC) are one of the most common cancers in
India. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as an emerging risk factor 
for HNC.
METHODS: The present study was carried out to determine the active form of HPV-16
using a combination of PCR, viral load determination, HPV-16 E7 mRNA expression, 
p16, p53, and pRB immuno-histochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: A total of 226 HNC patients were enrolled in the present study.
Sixty-seven (29.7%) of HNC cases were found to be HPV DNA positive. Thirty-two
(14%) cases were HPV-16 DNA positive and 20 (9%) cases expressed HPV-16 E7 mRNA. 
HPV-16 mRNA/p16 positive cases had significantly increased viral load and
integrated HPV-16 DNA. In summary, of total HNC patients, 6% cases were positive 
for both HPV-16 DNA and p16, and 5% were positive for both E7 mRNA and p16 IHC.
We observed similar HPV-16 DNA/E7mRNA prevalence in oropharynx and oral cavity
sites, however, oropharynx SCC had significantly higher viral load.
CONCLUSION: Our results show low prevalence of active HPV-16 in North Indian HNC 
patients. HPV-16 E7 mRNA expression correlated with p16 nuclear positivity and
increased viral load. Therefore, E7 mRNA expression may be used as a good
surrogate indicator for active form of HPV-16 infection.
