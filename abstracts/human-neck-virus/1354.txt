BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and 
p16 expression was unknown in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: We retrospectively studied our pathology database for 13 years to
determine the prevalence of EBV and p16 expression and their association with
prognosis in cases of NPC. We performed immunohistochemistry for the p16 protein 
and in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBV-encoded small RNAs and human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA.
RESULTS: Of the 43 patients with NPC, 27 (63%), 6 (14%), and 10 (23%) cases were 
EBV positive, EBV negative with keratinization, and EBV negative without
keratinization, respectively. No cases were HPV positive by ISH. Among the 21
EBV-positive tumours that were tested for p16, only 2 tumours were p16 positive. 
The keratinization-positive group included only males, typically >60 years of age
(5 of 6) and with T4 tumours (3 of 6). In contrast, the EBV-positive cohort
tended to be younger (<60 years, 13 of 27) and have progressive N-stage tumours
(N2-3, 14 of 27). The keratinization and EBV-negative cohort included
predominantly males (9 of 10) who were likely p16 negative (4 of 10) and smokers 
(7 of 10). Multivariate analysis confirmed that keratinization was an independent
prognostic factor for progression-free survival.
CONCLUSION: In areas, such as Japan, that are nonendemic for both EBV and HPV,
the causality of NPC appears to be more heterogeneous.
