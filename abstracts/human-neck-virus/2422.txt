BACKGROUND/AIM: To explore the therapeutic effects of thymidine kinase (TK)
expressed by enhanced vector pGL3-basic- hTERTp-TK-EGFP-CMV driven by human
telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (hTERTp) as well as cytomegalovirus
immediate early promoter enhancer (CMV).
MATERIALS/METHODS: Enhanced TK-EGFP expression was confirmed by fluorescent
microscopy, real time PCR and telomerase activity. Its effects were examined by
survival of tumor cells NPC 5-8F and MCF-7, index of xenograft implanted in nude 
mice and histology.
RESULTS: Compared with non-enhanced vector pGL3-basic-TK-hTERTp-EGFP, TK
expressed by the enhanced vector significantly decreased NPC 5-8F and MCF-7 cell 
survival rates after ganciclovir (GCV) treatment (p < 0.001) and tumor progress
in nude mice with NPC xenograft and treated with GCV, without obvious toxicity to
mouse liver and kidney.
CONCLUSION: The enhanced TK expression vector driven by hTERTp with CMV enhancer 
has brighter clinical potentials in nasopharyngeal carcinoma therapy than the
non-enhanced vector.
