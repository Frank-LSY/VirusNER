Human papillomavirus (HPV), a known etiology of a subset of head-and-neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNCs), causes numerous alterations in normal cellular
functions. This article reviews the biology, detection, and treatment of
HPV-positive HNC. The role of HPV oncoproteins in tumor development, the natural 
history of HPV infection, and risk factors for and prevention of transmission of 
oral HPV are considered. Commonly used methods for detecting HPV infection,
including limitations of these methods, are discussed to aid the practicing
clinician in using these tests in their clinical practice. Clinical
characteristics of HPV-positive HNC, including potential explanations for the
improved outcomes seen in patients with HPV-positive HNC, are assessed. Ongoing
clinical trials specific for patients with HPV-positive HNC are described, and
areas in need of additional research are summarized. Until the results of ongoing
trials are known, treatment of HPV-positive HNC should not differ in clinical
practice from treatment of similar non-HPV related cancers.
