Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a growing problem that presents a significant challenge to Otolaryngologist-Head and Neck Surgeons. Knowledge of HPV status yields critical prognostic information, with potential for treatment selection based on tumour HPV status. The current gold standard of diagnosis, PCR, is expensive, demanding and time consuming. Alternatives such as p16 immunohistochemistry are subjective and potentially inaccurate. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, robust and inexpensive molecular diagnostic technique.
