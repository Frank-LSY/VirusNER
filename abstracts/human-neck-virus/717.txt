BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore urinary Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-DNA as a potential biomarker in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC).
METHODS: EBV-DNA copies were estimated in plasma/urine of patients with NPC
(n = 76) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at baseline, during
therapy, and at follow-up. Their correlation with EBV-RNA expression in tissues
(n = 53) was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of plasma/urine EBV-DNA. 
Correlation of urine and plasma EBV-DNA with each other and with radiological
response was evaluated.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated that urine EBV-DNA has high sensitivity (96%) at
diagnosis and it correlates well with plasma EBV-DNA at baseline and after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The EBV-DNA copies reduced significantly with therapy
(plasma: p < .001; urine: p = .011). Patients with low EBV-DNA copies
demonstrated improved survival (plasma: p = .023; urine: p = .083).
CONCLUSION: Plasma EBV-DNA is a good prognostic marker, whereas further study on 
a larger cohort may help in developing urine EBV-DNA as a surrogate prognostic
marker for patients with NPC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:
