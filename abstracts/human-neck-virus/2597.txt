Treatment of head and neck cancers is still rather poor and worldwide new
treatment options are sought. Sensitizing radioresistant tumours by combining
irradiation with other therapeutics to induce apoptosis are widely investigated. 
We examined whether chicken anaemia virus-derived apoptin protein would have a
beneficial effect on irradiation of radiosensitive SCC61 and radioresistant SQD9 
human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines. In both cell lines, concurrent
exposure to irradiation and apoptin resulted in analysed mitochondrial cytochrome
c release and in cleavage of caspase-3, whereas irradiation alone of SQD9 cells
under identical conditions did not. Moreover, in comparison with the irradiation,
only the synchronized treatment of apoptin and irradiation resulted in increased 
cell death in especially the radioresistant SQD9 cells, as measured by means of a
colony survival assay. Our data reveal that apoptin treatment represents an
effective way for enhancing radiotherapy of tumours responding poorly to
radiotherapy.
