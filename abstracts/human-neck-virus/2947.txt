CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (L.GG) was present in all adenoids of
children receiving the L. GG product. However, since L.GG was also found from the
placebo group, one cannot confirm its effect on the occurrence of rhinovirus (RV)
or enterovirus (EV).
OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to determine whether a 3-week oral
consumption of L.GG would lead to presence of the probiotic in adenoid tissue.
Furthermore, nasopharyngeal RV and EV findings and symptom data were
investigated.
METHOD: The tissue samples were collected from 40 children aged 1-5 years about
to undergo adenotomy due to recurrent acute/secretory otitis media, chronic
rhinitis, or recurrent sinusitis after a 3-week daily consumption of L.GG (n =
20) or placebo (n = 20). Strain-specific real-time PCR was used to detect RV, EV,
and L.GG in adenoid tissue.
RESULTS: L.GG was recovered in the adenoid sample in 100% of children in the L.GG
group and in 76% in the placebo group (p = 0.07). Both RV and EV were found in
31% of children in the L.GG group and in 18% of children in the placebo group (p 
= 0.67). The majority of the positive samples were positive for both RV and EV.
Study diaries showed no differences in symptoms between the groups.
