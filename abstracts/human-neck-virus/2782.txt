BACKGROUND: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) causes characteristic cutaneous lesions
that occur mainly in children, sexually active adults, and immunocompromised
individuals, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
Patients infected with HIV, particularly those with advanced disease, have an
increased incidence, up to 33.3%, of MC in non-anogenital areas. MC has been
rarely found to be associated with epidermoid cysts.
CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old male with HIV infection presented with the complaint
of a-3-month history of a tender nodule on the left neck. H&E stained sections
showed a ruptured cyst, lined with squamous epithelium showing cytopathic changes
of MC, and a xanthogranuloma-like inflammatory reaction with characteristic
Touton-type giant cells.
CONCLUSION: MC infections are common, however MC associated with epidermoid cysts
is infrequent. A few cases of MC occurring in epidermoid cysts have previously
been reported. We are presenting a case of MC involving an epidermoid cyst in an 
AIDS patient, with a unique xanthogranuloma-like reaction. Xanthogranulomatous
(XG) reactions have been infrequently reported in association with other viral
infections, however, poxvirus-associated XG reaction has only been observed in
animals. This is the first reported case of MC-associated XG reaction in humans.
