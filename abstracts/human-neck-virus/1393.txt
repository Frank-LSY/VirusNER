BACKGROUND/AIM: Current guidelines derived from a pre-human papilloma virus (HPV)
era in oropharyngeal cancer do not recommend routine surveillance imaging. We
aimed to analyze the method of recurrence detection in HPV+ disease to determine 
a role for follow-up imaging.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal cancer patients treated at 
our institution from 2005-2016 with biopsy-proven recurrence were identified and 
their method of recurrence detection was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 16 HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer patients were identified to have
recurrence, 12 (75%) of which experienced distant recurrence and 13 (81.3%) were 
detected asymptomatically with imaging at a median time of 19.7 months after
initial treatment and verifying no residual disease. Twelve (75%) detections were
with PET-CT. While HPV- patients (17 patients) also have a high rate of
asymptomatic detection (16 patients, 94.1%), their 3-year post-recurrence
survival was significantly lower at 6.5% compared to 83.6% for the HPV+ group
(p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: In HPV+ patients, a large proportion of failures are asymptomatic
distant metastases, which occur beyond 6 months following treatment completion,
and are detected with whole body imaging alone. In light of long term
post-recurrence survival observed, this preliminary data suggests that routine
surveillance imaging should be further studied for HPV+ disease.
