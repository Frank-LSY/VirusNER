PURPOSE: To determine the level of knowledge university freshmen have of the
human papillomavirus (HPV), including awareness of the virus, the associated
risks, and prevention.
METHODS: A multiple-choice questionnaire was sent electronically to all
freshman-level students registered at Texas State University. One-way ANOVA and
Spearman correlation coefficients were run to identify significant differences in
knowledge levels between sex, age, and ethnicity.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses identified no strong differentiation of knowledge
about HPV among students. This indicated that increased education on the subject 
of HPV was needed by all of the students without regard to sex, ethnicity, age,
or self-identified history of HPV education.
DISCUSSION: Knowledge level of HPV risks, prevention, transmission, and
progression seemed high in some areas and low in others. Most students understand
that cervical cancer is a risk associated with HPV; however, many students were
unaware that head and neck, anal, and penile cancer also are associated with
infection. Knowledge levels seem to be consistent among students of both genders 
and various ethnicities.
CONCLUSION: Student knowledge of HPV has increased since the introduction of the 
HPV vaccine and related media coverage, although knowledge on the subject is
still low and often inaccurate. Because college-aged students are at a higher
risk of contracting the virus, educational measures must be taken to ensure all
students are aware of the risks and are better prepared to protect themselves.
