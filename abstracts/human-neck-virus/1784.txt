Functional mouse double minute-2 (MDM2) promoter variants may alter MDM2
expression and thus affect radiotherapy response and prognosis of squamous cell
carcinoma of oropharynx (SCCOP). Thus we assessed association of 2 functional
MDM2 promoter variants with recurrence risk of SCCOP. The disease-free survival
(DFS) of patients with MDM2rs2279744 TT or MDM2rs937283 AA genotypes was
significantly reduced compared with that of patients with corresponding GT/GG or 
AG/GG genotypes. Multivariable analysis showed patients with TT or AA genotypes
had a significantly higher risk of SCCOP recurrence than those with corresponding
GT/GG or AG/GG genotypes did. Furthermore, patients with combined risk genotypes 
of the 2 polymorphisms had significantly worse DFS and a higher recurrence risk
than patients with fewer combined risk genotypes did (Ptrend < 0.001). Compared
with patients with 0 risk genotypes, patients with 1 or 2 risk genotypes had an
approximately 3- or 11-fold increased risk of SCCOP recurrence, respectively.
Notably, for both individual and combined polymorphisms, the above similar
recurrence risks were particularly higher among patients with human papilloma
virus (HPV)-positive tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest that MDM2
promoter variants individually, or more likely jointly, play a role in
determining the risk of recurrence of SCCOP, particularly HPV-positive SCCOP.
