OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationships of cystic nodal metastasis, human
papillomavirus (HPV) status, and treatment failure patterns in patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pretreatment MRI and clinical courses of
patients with OPSCC whose tumors were tested for HPV-induced p16 expression via
immunohistochemistry and who completed chemoradiotherapy. Cervical cystic nodal
metastasis and necrotic nodal metastasis were classified on MRI.
RESULTS: Of 98 patients eligible for analysis, 33 were p16-positive. Cystic nodal
metastasis was significantly more prevalent in p16-positive than in p16-negative 
patients (39.4% versus 18.5%, respectively; p = 0.025). Necrotic nodal metastasis
was significantly more prevalent in p16-negative than in p16-positive patients
(73.8% versus 51.5%, respectively; p = 0.027). On multivariate analysis, necrotic
nodal metastasis (odds ratio [OR] = 7.310, p = 0.011) was an independent
predictor of regional failure, while advanced nodal stage (OR = 4.119, p = 0.022)
and cystic nodal metastases (OR = 0.087, p = 0.026) were independent positive and
negative predictors of distant failure, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical cystic and necrotic nodal metastases are associated with
HPV-induced p16-positive and p16-negative OPSCC, respectively. Patients with
necrotic nodal metastasis at presentation have an increased risk of regional
failure. Distant failure is directly and inversely correlated with advanced nodal
stage and cystic nodal metastasis, respectively.
