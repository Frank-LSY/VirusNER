rVTT-TA35-TJ, an attenuated vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (VTT), was constructed by knocking out two non-essential gene fragments (TA35R and TJ2R) related to virulence, immunomodulation, and host range; and by combining double marker screening with exogenous and endogenous selectable marker knock-out techniques. Here, the shuttle plasmids pSK-TA35 and pSK-TJ were constructed, containing two pairs of recombinant arms: early and late strong promoter pE/L and EGFP as an exogenous selectable marker. The recombinant vaccinia virus rVTT-TA35-TJ without exogenous selection markers was then obtained through homologous recombination technology and the Cre/loxP system. Knocking out the two gene fragments does not affect the replication ability of the virus and displays a good genetic stability. Furthermore, a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that although virulence of rVTT-TA35-TJ is attenuated significantly, high immunogenicity was maintained. These results support the potential development of rVTT-TA35-TJ as a safe viral vector or vaccine.
