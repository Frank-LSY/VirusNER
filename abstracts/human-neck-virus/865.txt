In recent years there has been change in trends in the incidence of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) showing an
increased incidence, attributable specifically to infection by human
papillomavirus (HPV). At the same time there is change in demographic
characteristics and prognosis of this subset of HNSCC. Considering the better
prognosis, researchers are trying to reduce the acute and long-term toxicities by
alteration of various components of treatment protocols. Although treatment
deintensification is an option for this group of patients, there is no standard
protocol available and should be tried only in the protocol setting.
