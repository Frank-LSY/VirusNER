OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine posttreatment quality of life (QOL) in head
and neck cancer patients, stratifying by human papillomavirus (HPV)/p16 status
and primary treatment modality.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients (N=177) with head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma and known HPV/p16 status were included. All patients
completed at least one baseline or posttreatment University of Washington QOL
survey. QOL scores were averaged and compared across patients, stratifying by
HPV/p16 status and primary treatment modality (surgical vs. nonsurgical). In the 
analysis, p16 was used as a surrogate marker for HPV.
RESULTS: Of the 177 patients, 80 (45.2%) were p16-positive and 49.7% of subsites 
were oropharyngeal. Nearly 60% (105/177) of patients underwent primary surgery,
26.7% (28/105) of patients with transoral robotic or laser techniques. The
remainder 40.7% of patients underwent primary radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Overall, QOL scores were better for p16-positive patients compared to
p16-negative patients at baseline (P=0.008), at 6 months posttreatment (P=0.034),
and at greater than 1 year posttreatment (P=0.013). P16-positive patients had
better QOL scores in speech (P=0.0009), chewing (P=0.0004), and swallowing
(P=0.021) after 1 year posttreatment compared to p16-negative patients. Primary
treatment modality did not affect overall QOL or any of the 12 QOL categories in 
p16-positive patients at any time point. At over 1 year posttreatment, QOL was at
or above baseline in both p16-positive treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The p16-positive patients had better baseline and posttreatment
overall QOL compared to p16-negative patients. The overall and category specific 
QOL scores for p16-positive patients were not affected by primary treatment
modality.
