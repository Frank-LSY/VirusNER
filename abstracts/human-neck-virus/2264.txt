The aim was to explore the overall survival (OS) for palatine tonsillar squamous 
cell carcinoma (TSCC), subdivided, according to certainty of tonsillar tumour
origin, into specified tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (STSCCs) and
nonspecified tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (NSTSCCs), and base of tongue
squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) when stratifying for HPV DNA status, p16
expression and combined HPV/p16 status. We included all patients (n = 797)
diagnosed with TSCCs and BSCCs in Eastern Denmark as registered in the Danish
Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) database and the Danish Pathology Databank, 
2000-2010. Patients were treated according to national guidelines (radiotherapy
+/- concomitant cisplatin). All specimens were analysed using HPV DNA PCR and p16
immunohistochemistry. Clinical information was retrieved from the DAHANCA
database and the Danish National Patient Registry. Information on vital status
was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System. We observed improved OS
for HPV+/p16+ BSCCs compared to HPV-/p16- (hazard ratio for death [HR], 0.15; 95%
CI, 0.09-0.24). Among STSCCs, HPV+/p16+ showed the lowest HR (0.19, 95% CI,
0.13-0.29); whereas, HPV-/p16+ showed an intermediate HR (0.39; 95% CI,
0.22-0.70). For NSTSCCs, HPV+/p16+ and HPV-/p16+ showed similar OS (HRs, 0.39;
95% CI, 0.26-0.59; and 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.95, respectively). Combined HPV+/p16+
was a significantly better prognostic marker in BSCCs and STSCCs than HPV DNA and
p16, alone (all p-values < 0.05). Whereas, combined testing in NSTSCC was not
better than p16 (p = 0.53), alone. In conclusion, double positivity for HPV/p16
in conjunction with the certainty of tumour site improved prognosis.
