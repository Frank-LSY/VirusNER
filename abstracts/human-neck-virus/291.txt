IMPORTANCE: Management of cervical unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma (CUP) 
has evolved with the introduction of transoral robotic surgery (TORS).
OBJECTIVES: 1. To describe the efficacy of TORS lingual and palatine
tonsillectomy in identifying the primary site of malignancy. 2. To explore how
the extent of surgery affects diagnostic yield. 3. To report margin status of
TORS resections.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study
utilizing a prospectively collected database of CUP patients in a high-volume
tertiary referral center. Patient underwent operative laryngoscopy plus TORS as
clinically indicated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was successful identification of
the primary. The extent of surgery and margin status were also examined.
RESULTS: From 2010-2016, 64 patients with CUP were treated. The primary tumor was
found in 51 patients (80%). Fourteen patients (22%) were identified with
operative laryngoscopy alone. Fifty patients underwent TORS lingual tonsillectomy
± palatine tonsillectomy with 37 primary tumors identified (74%). The primary was
located in the lingual tonsil in 32 patients (86%) and palatine tonsil in 5
patients (10%, p<0.001). Negative margins were achieved in 19 patients (51%). The
deep margin was the most commonly positive margin (47%, p=0.049).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Operative laryngoscopy with TORS is efficacious,
localizing the primary in 80% of patients. If a margin was positive, it was most 
commonly the deep margin. This study provides valuable information that can help 
standardize surgical technique, further increasing the diagnostic yield and
decreasing the negative margin rate of TORS for CUP.
