The immunohistochemical studies revealed CD20+ germinal centres with prominent staining of CD23+ dendritic reticular cells, surrounded by numerous interfollicular CD3+, and CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. Factor VIII-related antigen, CD31 and CD34 occurred in the thin-walled blood vessels. The reactivity of CD1a, HHV-8 and EBV-associated latent membrane protein 1-EBV (LMP1-EBV) were negative, and in situ hybridisation confirmed the lack of EBV DNA. No patient recalled an external insult or chronic irritation.
