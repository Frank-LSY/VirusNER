BACKGROUND: To determine genomic alterations in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors obtained 
through routine clinical practice, selected cancer-related genes were evaluated
and compared with alterations seen in frozen tumors obtained through research
studies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA samples obtained from 252 FFPE HNSCC were analyzed
using next-generation sequencing-based (NGS) clinical assay to determine sequence
and copy number variations in 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19
genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was
determined by presence of the HPV DNA sequence in all samples and corroborated
with high-risk HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) and p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) 
staining in a subset of tumors. Sequencing data from 399 frozen tumors in The
Cancer Genome Atlas and University of Chicago public datasets were analyzed for
comparison.
RESULTS: Among 252 FFPE HNSCC, 84 (33%) were HPV positive and 168 (67%) were HPV 
negative by sequencing. A subset of 40 tumors with HPV ISH and p16 IHC results
showed complete concordance with NGS-derived HPV status. The most common genes
with genomic alterations were PIK3CA and PTEN in HPV-positive tumors and TP53 and
CDKN2A/B in HPV-negative tumors. In the pathway analysis, the PI3K pathway in
HPV-positive tumors and DNA repair-p53 and cell cycle pathways in HPV-negative
tumors were frequently altered. The HPV-positive oropharynx and HPV-positive
nasal cavity/paranasal sinus carcinoma shared similar mutational profiles.
CONCLUSION: The genomic profile of FFPE HNSCC tumors obtained through routine
clinical practice is comparable with frozen tumors studied in research setting,
demonstrating the feasibility of comprehensive genomic profiling in a clinical
setting. However, the clinical significance of these genomic alterations requires
further investigation through application of these genomic profiles as integral
biomarkers in clinical trials.
