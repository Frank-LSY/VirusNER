Human macrophage dectin-1, a type II transmembrane β-glucan receptor, was
expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag in a
baculovirus-silkworm expression system and assayed for binding activity.
Recombinant dectin-1 specifically bound to some β-glucans, and the neck domain
and N-linked oligosaccharide chains of human dectin-1 did not affect the ligand
binding activity and specificity of the receptor.
