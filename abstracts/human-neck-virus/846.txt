Human-papillomaviruses (HPV) type 16 is a causative agent in an increasing subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs). These tumors have distinct oncogenic mechanisms and a more favorable prognosis than tobacco-induced OPSCCs. Although these differences emphasize the need for a specific therapeutic approach, HPV status is still not used to guide treatment. A better characterization of the molecular profile related to HPV16-induced OPSCC might help to develop personalized treatments.
