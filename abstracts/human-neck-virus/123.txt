Human papilloma virus (HPV), usually type 16, has emerged as an aetiological and 
prognostic marker of oropharyngeal carcinomas, and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with
carcinoma of the head and neck. This makes the identification of cancers
associated with these biomarkers important in the management of patients. We
surveyed UK head and neck multidisciplinary teams by email using an online form
to assess the use of biomarker testing. Overall 33 cancer networks were contacted
and 28 (85%) responded. HPV tests were used in departments by 22 (79%) of our
respondents, while only 3 (11%) used EGFR tests. The commonest reasons for not
using them were lack of availability and lack of clinical indication.
