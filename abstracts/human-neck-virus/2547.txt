The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III machinery
contributes to membrane deformation and scission in cytokinesis, intraluminal
vesicle formation, autophagy and virus budding. Recombinant ESCRT-III subunits
polymerize in vitro into filaments, tubes, sheets or rings, and
ESCRT-III-dependent filaments have been observed in cells at virus bud necks and 
at the cytokinetic abscission site. These observations have inspired speculation 
about how ESCRT-III could mediate constriction and fission of membrane necks.
Based on the polymer structures observed in vitro and in vivo, we discuss models 
for ESCRT-III function and outline how emerging technologies could be used to
test these models.
