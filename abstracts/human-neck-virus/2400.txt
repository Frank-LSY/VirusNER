Seborrheic inclusion cyst (SIC) is a very rare variant of epidermal cyst of the
skin. SIC shows seborrheic keratosis (SK)-like lesion in epidermal cyst. SIC is
extremely rare; only 6 case reports have been published in the English
literature. However, no immunohistochemical study of SIC has been reported. A
41-year-old Japanese man noticed a subcutaneous tumor in the neck. Physical
examination showed slightly mobile tumor in the subcutaneous tissue, and total
excision was performed. Grossly, the tumor (1 x 1 x 0.8 cm) was cyst containing
atheromatous keratin. Microscopically, the lesion is a cyst containing keratins. 
About one half of the cyst showed features of epidermal cyst consisting of mature
squamous epithelium with granular layers. The other one half showed SK-like
epidermal proliferation. The SK-like area showed basaloid cell proliferation with
pseudohorn cysts. No significant atypia was noted. Many eosinophilic cytoplasmic 
inclusion bodies were noted in the SK-like area. Immunohistochemically, the
SK-like area was positive for pancytokeratin AE1/3, pancytokeratin CAM5.2, p63,
and Ki-67 (labeling=8%) and HPV, but negative for p53. The pathological diagnosis
was SIC.
