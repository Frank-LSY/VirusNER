During the past decade, there has been a significant increase in knowledge
regarding the molecular biology and epigenetics of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC). This has been aided by the steady development of new
technology and novel techniques aimed at elucidating additional aberrant
molecular alterations characteristic of HNSCC, including the advent of high
throughput assays and the development of more sophisticated bioinformatics tools.
In addition, advancements in the field of cancer epigenetics and microRNA have
increased the complexity of understanding HNSCC tumorigenesis. These advances
have lead to an increasing number of translational studies in the diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of head and neck cancer. The end result is that
molecular biomarkers, gene detection panels and targeted therapeutics are
becoming a reality for the care of patients with HNSCC. In this article, we will 
focus on the many implications of this research as it pertains to clinical
practice and the treatment of HNSCC patients.
