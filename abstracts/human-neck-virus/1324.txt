BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as an etiopathogenetic
factor in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes are 
instrumental in promoting proliferation and blocking differentiation leading to
tumorigenesis. Although surgical intervention can remove such tumors, the
potential for an etiologic field effect with recurrent disease is real. A
downstream effector of E7 oncoprotein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), is
known to promote proliferation and to pose a block in differentiation and in
turn, could lead to HPV-induced malignant transformation. However, the EZH2
pathway is amenable to low toxicity therapies designed to promote differentiation
to a more benign state and prevent recurrent disease by inhibiting the
incorporation of HPV into the genome. This is the first study using clinical
specimens to demonstrate EZH2 protein expression in oropharyngeal carcinoma
(OPC).
METHODS: The study included eight patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma,
confirmed p16INK4a- positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The tissue expression
of E6/E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by RNAscopeÂ® in-situ hybridization
technology. Expression of EZH2, Ki-67, and mitotic indices were assessed by
morphoproteomic analysis. Biomedical analytics expanded the results with data
from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and KEGG databases to construct a molecular
network pathway for further insights.
RESULTS: Expression of E6 and E7 oncogenes in p16INK4a- positive oropharyngeal
carcinoma was confirmed. EZH2 and its correlates, including elevated
proliferation index (Ki-67) and mitotic progression were also present. Biomedical
analytics validated the relationship between HPV- E6 and E7 and the expression of
the EZH2 pathway.
CONCLUSION: There is morphoproteomic and mRNA evidence of the association of
p16INK4a-HPV infection with the E6 and E7 oncogenes and the expression of EZH2,
Ki-67 and mitotic progression in oropharyngeal carcinoma. The molecular network
biology was confirmed by biomedical analytics as consistent with published
literature. This is significant because the biology lends itself to targeted
therapeutic options using metformin, curcumin, celecoxib and sulforaphane as
therapeutic strategies to prevent progression or recurrence of disease.
