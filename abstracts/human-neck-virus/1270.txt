The objective of this study was to determine if matrix metalloproteinase-7
(MMP-7) expression is related to human papilloma virus (HPV) status, clinical
parameters, and outcome in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Tumor
tissue specimens from 201 OPSCC patients treated with curative intent were
available for immunohistochemistry, and the samples were stained with monoclonal 
MMP-7 antibody. All the patients were followed up at least 3 years or until
death. MMP-7 expression did not differ between HPV-positive and HPV-negative
patients. MMP-7 was not prognostic among patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. In the
HPV-positive subgroup, patients with moderate, high, or very high MMP-7
expression had significantly worse 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) (56.6%)
than patients with absent, or low MMP-7 expression (77.2%), and MMP-7 expression 
appeared as a prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. In addition, among 
HPV-positive OPSCC with moderate, high, or very high MMP-7 expression, the 5-year
distant recurrence-free survival was significantly lower (69.6%) than in those
who had low or absent MMP-7 expression (97.5%). Our results suggest that among
HPV-positive OPSCC patients, high MMP-7 expression is related to worse 5-year DSS
and increased rate of distant recurrences.
