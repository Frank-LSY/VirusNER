Purpose: Gaps remain in the public's knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV).
We assessed racial/ethnic and gender disparities in knowledge and awareness of
HPV and the HPV vaccine among US adults.METHODS: Data from the Health Information
National Trends Survey 4 Cycle 3 (September - December 2013) and Cycle 4 (August 
- November 2014) were analyzed for 6,862 respondents aged 18Â years and older.
Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate
racial/ethnic and gender disparities in HPV knowledge and HPV vaccination
awareness.
RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of respondents had heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine
(57% of men vs. 75% of women). In multivariable analyses, compared with men,
women were 225% (95% CI: 2.60 - 4.07) more likely to have heard of HPV, and 281% 
(95% CI: 3.06 - 4.74) more likely to have heard of the HPV vaccine. Non-Hispanic 
Blacks were 33% (95% CI: 0.47 - 0.96) and 44% (95% CI: 0.39 - 0.81) less likely
than non-Hispanic Whites to have heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine, respectively. 
Hispanics were 27% (95% CI: 0.52 - 1.02) and 53% (95% CI: 0.34 - 0.64) less
likely than non-Hispanic Whites to have heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of disparities in HPV and HPV vaccine awareness
among men compared with women and non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics compared with
non-Hispanic Whites. To foster improvements in HPV vaccine uptake and reduce
disparities in HPV associated cancers, future interventions must target men and
minority populations, for whom knowledge gaps exist.
