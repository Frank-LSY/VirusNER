BACKGROUND: Cutaneous head and neck melanoma has poor outcomes and limited
treatment options. In OPTiM, a phase 3 study in patients with unresectable stage 
IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma, intralesional administration of the oncolytic virus
talimogene laherparepvec improved durable response rate (DRR; continuous response
≥6 months) compared with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF).
METHODS: Retrospective review of OPTiM identified patients with cutaneous head
and neck melanoma given talimogene laherparepvec (n = 61) or GM-CSF (n = 26).
Outcomes were compared between talimogene laherparepvec and GM-CSF treated
patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma.
RESULTS: DRR was higher for talimogene laherparepvec-treated patients than for
GM-CSF treated patients (36.1% vs 3.8%; p = .001). A total of 29.5% of patients
had a complete response with talimogene laherparepvec versus 0% with GM-CSF.
Among talimogene laherparepvec-treated patients with a response, the probability 
of still being in response after 12 months was 73%. Median overall survival (OS) 
was 25.2 months for GM-CSF and had not been reached with talimogene
laherparepvec.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec was associated with improved 
response and survival compared with GM-CSF in patients with cutaneous head and
neck melanoma. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: 1752-1758, 2016.
