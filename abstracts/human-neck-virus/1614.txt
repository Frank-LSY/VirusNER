BACKGROUND: The prognostic utility of comorbidity on head and neck cancer may
differ by subsite, stage, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 4953 patients with head and neck
cancer for comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), smoking, and alcohol
history. Multivariate proportional hazards assessed the association of CCI with
survival. HPV status was determined using p16 immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: After accounting for stage, higher CCI was associated with worse overall
survival (OS) in nasopharyngeal (hazard ratio [HR], 2.93; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.53-5.62), oropharyngeal (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.63-2.43), and oral cavity
cancers (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86). These associations were most prominent in 
the early stage oral cavity (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.50-2.96) and laryngeal (HR,
1.87; 95% CI, 1.35-2.58) cancers, and in advanced stage oropharyngeal (HR, 2.23; 
95% CI, 1.81-2.74) and nasopharyngeal (HR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.76-6.97) cancers. CCI 
was independently prognostic even in the HPV-adjusted oropharyngeal cancers.
CONCLUSION: Comorbidity was prognostic in subsets of nasopharyngeal,
oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers. Comorbidity may be a partial
surrogate for age and social habits.
