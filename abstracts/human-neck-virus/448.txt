Human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development of cervical cancer
and is also involved in vulvar, anus, penis and head and neck cancer. Little is
known about the role of HPV infection in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Through
a systematic review of the literature, we studied the HPV prevalence in
immunocompetent individuals in relation to NMSC. We found that HPV, including
multiple HPV types, tended to be more prevalent in NMSC, especially in squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to basal cell carcinoma and healthy skin,
indicating a potential link between HPV and SCC in immunocompetent individuals.
