Basic knowledge concerning the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is useful for ENT physicians. Although HIV
patients are usually stably asymptomatic nowadays due to modern therapy, HIV
often manifests in ENT symptoms, such as neck lumps, sore throat, difficulty
swallowing and dysgeusia. After infection, an initial increase in viral load can 
cause, among other symptoms, oral ulcers and pharyngitis. Once the immune system 
is compromised by the attack on CD4 lymphocyte cells, HIV-related diseases can
occur: oral mycoses (particularly candidosis) and viral infections (including
warts), aphthous ulcers, gingivitis, salivary gland diseases and malignancies (e.
g. intraoral Kaposi's sarcoma). Neck lymphadenopathy is frequent. Markers of
disease severity are the clinical symptoms, viral load and CD4 helper cell count.
HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy, ART) is a combination of at least three
antiviral drugs.
