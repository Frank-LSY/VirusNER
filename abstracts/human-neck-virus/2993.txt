BACKGROUND: Dermatologic malignancies are among the most common forms of cancer. 
Sun exposure is the major risk factor in white people, while non-solar factors
appear to be the leading risk factor in the darkly pigmented.
METHODS: We examined 162 patients with histologic diagnosis of dermatological
malignancy who consulted at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar 
from January 2000 to December 2009.
RESULTS: The 162 patient cases observed during the study represent 12% of all
cancers diagnosed within the same period. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the
most common (n = 62; 38.3% followed by Kaposi sarcoma (KS) (n = 33; 30.9%).
Others were malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 16; 9.9%), dermatofibrosarcoma
protuberans (DFSP) (n = 11; 6.8%), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 8; 4.9%). 
The lower limb was the most commonly afflicted site (n = 82; 48.8%) while the
head and neck ranked second (n = 32; 22.0%); 146 patients (90%) were darkly
pigmented and 16 (10%) were people with albinism. Some patients with SCC and MM
consulted late for curative surgery. Surgery resulted in healing in patients with
BCC, while the recurrent rate for DFSP was high. The endemic KS responded to
cytotoxic chemotherapy but the result was poor for KS associated with human
immunodeficiency virus.
CONCLUSION: The pattern of dermatologic malignancy revealed in this study is
different from that of European skin cancer. Health education, early
implementation of preventive measures, early consultation, and treatment will
improve outcome in our region.
