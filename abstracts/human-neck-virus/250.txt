Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are non-enveloped DNA tumor viruses that infect skin
and mucosa. The most oncogenic subtype, HPV16, causes various types of cancer,
including cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers. During the multistep process
of infection, numerous host proteins are required for the delivery of virus
genetic information into the nucleus of target cells. Over the last two decades, 
many host-cell proteins such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, integrins, growth 
factor receptors, actin and the tetraspanin CD151 have been described to be
involved in the process of infectious entry of HPV16. Tetraspanins have the
ability to organize membrane microdomains and to directly influence the function 
of associated molecules, including binding of receptors to their ligands,
receptor oligomerization and signal transduction. Here, we summarize the current 
knowledge on CD151, and CD151-associated partners during HPV infection and
discuss the underlying mechanisms.
