BACKGROUND: Several risk factors for depression in patients with oropharyngeal
cancer have been determined. However, it is unknown whether human papillomavirus 
associated oropharyngeal cancer, which has a distinct clinico-demographic
profile, modulates this risk.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with oropharyngeal
cancer. These patients had completed a 10-item depression screening questionnaire
before receiving treatment for their disease from 2011 to 2014. Associations
between patient or disease characteristics and depression screening questionnaire
results were investigated.
RESULTS: The study comprised 69 patients, 31 (44.9 per cent) of whom screened
positive for depression. There were no significant differences in distributions
of clinico-demographic or histopathological characteristics, including human
papillomavirus tumour status, by depression screen result.
CONCLUSION: This population has a high risk for depression, but no obvious risk
factors, including human papillomavirus tumour status, were associated with an
elevated risk. This inability to risk-stratify patients by clinico-demographic or
disease characteristics emphasises the importance of regular depression screening
for all patients in this population.
