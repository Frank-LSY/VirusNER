Given the crucial role of Mouse double minute 4 (MDM4) oncoprotein in p53
pathway, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could serve as such biomarkers
for prediction of SCCOP recurrence. Thus, we investigated associations between
three tagging putatively functional variants of MDM4, two in the 3' untranslated 
region of 3' UTR [rs11801299 (NC_000001.10:g.204529084G>A) and
rs10900598(NC_000001.10:g.204525568G>T)] and one in intron 1
[rs1380576(NC_000001.10:g.204488278G>C)], and recurrence risk of SCCOP in 1,008
incident patients. A log-rank test and multivariable Cox models were used to
assess associations. Patients with MDM4-rs10900598 GT/TT had a worse disease-free
survival (DFS) compared with corresponding GG genotype, while those with
rs11801299 AG/AA genotypes had a lower recurrence risk than the cases with
rs11801299 GG genotype (both log-rank, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed 
that significantly different recurrence risk were found among patients with
MDM4-rs10900598 GT/TT and rs11801299 AG/AA variant genotypes (HR, 2.0, 95% CI,
1.4-2.9 and HR, 0.4, 95% CI, 0.3-0.6, respectively) compared with their
corresponding common homozygous genotypes. Furthermore, after combining the risk 
genotypes of the three SNPs, patients among low-risk group had a significantly
lower risk of SCCOP recurrence than those in high-risk group (HR, 0.2, 95% CI,
0.1-0.3). The risk for both individual SNPs or combined risk genotypes was
restricted to HPV-positive SCCOP patients. Our findings suggest that the MDM4
polymorphisms may, individually or in combination, confer an independent risk of 
SCCOP recurrence, particularly in HPV-positive SCCOP patients. However, larger
studies are needed to validate our findings.
