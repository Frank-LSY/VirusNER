BACKGROUND: To assess the risk of subclinical neck nodal involvement of levels
IB, IV and V for early T-stage, node positive, human papilloma virus
(HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified the patients with clinically 
positive and un-violated neck that underwent upfront ipsilateral neck dissection 
for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer between 1998 and 2010. From the pathology
report we extracted the prevalence rate of involvement of each selected level and
then estimated the risk that a level that does not contain any node larger than
10 mm at computed tomography (CT) harbors subclinical disease. Predictors of
involvement were investigated as well.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were analyzed. The risk of subclinical disease in
both levels IB and V is < 5%, while it is 6.5% (95% CI 3.1-9.9%) for level IV.
Level IB subclinical involvement slightly exceeds 5% when 2 + ipsilateral levels 
besides IB are involved. The risk of occult disease in level IV tends to be < 5% 
when level III is not involved.
CONCLUSION: These data support the exclusion from the elective nodal volume of
level V and level IB but when 2 + other levels are involved. Level IV might also 
be spared when level III is negative. Clinical implementation within a
prospective study is justified.
