All patients diagnosed with OPSCC in 2000-2006 in two Dutch university hospitals were included. The presence of an oncogenic HPV infection was determined by p16-immunostaining, followed by a high-risk HPV general primer 5+/6+ DNA PCR on the p16-positive cases. Cox regression analysis was carried out to compare survival rates between HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients and a prognostic model was generated by recursive partitioning.
