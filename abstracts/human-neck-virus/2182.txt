OBJECTIVES: Several studies have involved antiretroviral therapy in the
pathogenesis of low bone mineral density (BMD), while others have not confirmed
this association. In this study we analyze the impact of HIV status, traditional 
risk factors and antiretroviral therapy in BMD in an HIV-infected population
living in Madrid.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 107 individuals 
infected with HIV and exposed to antiretroviral treatment to estimate the
prevalence of decreased BMD. Bone mineral density of lumbar spine and femoral
neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In a multivariate analysis
variables related with HIV status, antiretroviral drugs and traditional risk
factors were included.
RESULTS: Low BMD was diagnosed in 63 participants (58.9%), including osteoporosis
in 11 (10%). At least one cause of osteoporosis was identified in 43 patients
(40%), with a deficiency of vitamin D in 86 (89%) and secondary
hyperparathyroidism in 30 (28%). In multivariate analysis, increasing age, a
treatment based on boosted PI and tenofovir DF, and previous exposure to
tenofovir were identified as independent risk factors for a decreased BMD in both
lumbar spine and femoral neck.
CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed a high prevalence of reduced BMD, which is
favoured by ritonavir-boosted PI and TDF. Bone safety should continue to be
evaluated in clinical trials and cohort studies in order to demonstrate that the 
new drugs offer additional advantages regarding the impact on BMD.
