BACKGROUND: Most studies on human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been performed on white Americans. Our study
examined the incidence of HPV in an African American oropharyngeal SCC cohort and
its survival.
METHODS: African American patients with oropharyngeal SCC in a combined tumor
registry were identified. HPV16 testing was performed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) from DNA extracted from tumor blocks. The p16 staining was
performed using standard immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients were identified for analysis. Seventy-three percent 
of the tumors were HPV-positive. Only 39% of the patients who were HPV-positive
were also p16-positive. Survival between all 3 tumor types, patients who tested
HPV-positive/p16, HPV-positive/p16-positive, and HPV-negative/p16-negative was
significantly different (p = .03). HPV/p16 status was significant on univariate
and multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: HPV oropharyngeal SCC is strongly present in this African American
cohort. Two thirds of the patients who were HPV-positive were p16-negative.
Greater study is needed to explain the high p16 negativity among this
HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC African American cohort. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals,
