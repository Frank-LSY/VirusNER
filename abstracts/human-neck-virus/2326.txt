BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological data have implicated human papilloma virus
(HPV) infection in the pathogenesis of head and neck cancers, especially
oropharyngeal cancers. Although, HPV has been detected in varied amounts in
persons with oral dysplasia, leukoplakias and malignancies, its involvement in
oral tongue carcinogenesis remains ambiguous.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPV DNA prevalence was assessed by PCR with formalin fixed
paraffin embedded sections (n=167) of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma
patients and the physical status of the HPV16 DNA was assessed by qPCR.
Immunohistochemistry was conducted for p16 evaluation.
RESULTS: We found the HPV prevalence in tongue cancers to be 51.2%, HPV 16 being 
present in 85.2% of the positive cases. A notable finding was a very poor
concordance between HPV 16 DNA and p16 IHC findings (kappa<0.2). Further
molecular classification of patients based on HPV16 DNA prevalence and p16
overexpression showed that patients with tumours showing p16 overexpression had
increased hazard of death (HR=2.395; p=0.005) and disease recurrence (HR=2.581;
p=0.002) irrespective of their HPV 16 DNA status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has brought out several key facets which can potentially
redefine our understanding of tongue cancer tumorigenesis. It has emphatically
shown p16 overexpression to be a single important prognostic variable in defining
a high risk group and depicting a poorer prognosis, thus highlighting the need
for its routine assessment in tongue cancers. Another significant finding was a
very poor concordance between p16 expression and HPV infection suggesting that
p16 expression should possibly not be used as a surrogate marker for HPV
infection in tongue cancers. Interestingly, the prognostic significance of p16
overexpression is different from that reported in oropharyngeal cancers. The
mechanism of HPV independent p16 over expression in oral tongue cancers is
possibly a distinct entity and needs to be further studied.
