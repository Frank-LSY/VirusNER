Cowpox virus infection of humans is an uncommon, potentially fatal, skin disease.
It is largely confined to Europe, but is not found in Eire, or in the USA,
Australasia, or the Middle or Far East. Patients having contact with infected
cows, cats, or small rodents sporadically contract the disease from these
animals. We report here clinical aspects of 8 patients from the Munich area who
had purchased infected pet rats from a local supplier. Pet rats are a novel
potential source of local outbreaks. The morphologically distinctive skin lesions
are mostly restricted to the patients' necks, reflecting the infected animals'
contact pattern. Individual lesions vaguely resemble orf or Milker's nodule, but 
show marked surrounding erythema, firm induration and local adenopathy. Older
lesions develop eschar, leaving slow-healing, deep ulcerative defects after
eschar separation. Severe flu-like illness may be present in the acute phase.
Smallpox-vaccinated patients tend to develop less severe reactions and heal more 
quickly. The differential diagnosis may include other localized orthopoxvirus
infections, herpes simplex, bacterial infection, anthrax, foreign body granuloma,
and primary tuberculosis. Dermatologists should be aware of the diagnostic and
therapeutic algorithms for handling this disease.
