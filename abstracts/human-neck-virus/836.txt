Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a potential precursor of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in the pediatric transplant patient. Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging is increasingly utilized in this population to monitor for neoplasia and PTLD. We assess the association between EBV serum titers and Waldeyer's ring and cervical lymph node PET positivity in the pediatric transplant recipient.
