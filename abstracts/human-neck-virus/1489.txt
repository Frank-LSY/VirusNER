BACKGROUND: HPV-associated OSCC (HPV-OSCC) has been determined to be a distinct
disease entity from non-HPV associated OSCC. Patients affected by HPV-OSCC
generally have a more favourable prognosis, with improved rates of locoregional
control and survival compared with their non-HPV counterparts. Despite this,
HPV-OSCC has a similar rate of distant metastases. Interestingly, recent evidence
has emerged that demonstrates more frequent atypical metastasis patterns when
compared to non-HPV associated disease. To the best of our knowledge, this report
describes the first case of a confirmed HPV-OSCC with distant metastasis to the
cavernous sinus.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old non-smoking male presented to the head and neck 
oncology clinic with a five-month history of enlarging right neck mass causing
neck pain, dysphagia, and dysphonia. HPV-associated base of tongue squamous cell 
carcinoma (cT4aN2c) was diagnosed, and he was treated with primary
chemoradiation. Shortly after treatment, he presented with progressive bilateral 
cranial nerve palsies including left cranial nerve III and right cranial nerve VI
involvement. Imaging identified masses in the left cavernous sinus with extension
of tumor into the sella and in the right cavernous sinus at the level of
Dorello's canal. Endoscopic Image Guided Transsphenoidal biopsy of the left
sellar mass confirmed distant metastases from the previously treated HPV-OSCC
primary to the cavernous sinus. The patient was palliated with carboplatin and
paclitaxel.
CONCLUSION: The presented report is the first documented case of confirmed
HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasizing to the
cavernous sinus, and the only HPV confirmed head and neck cancer case to present 
with metastasis to the cavernous sinus and limited extracranial disease. This
case demonstrates the importance of recognizing presentations of atypical
metastasis that are possible in HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Given the
rarity of metastasis to this region, vigilance in follow up is instrumental in
early identification and treatment for these patients.
