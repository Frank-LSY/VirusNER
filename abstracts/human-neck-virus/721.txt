Smoking is a well-known behavior that has an important negative impact on human
health, and is considered to be a significant factor related to the development
and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Use of
high-dimensional datasets to discern novel HNSCC driver genes related to smoking 
represents an important challenge. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis was
performed in three co-existing groups of HNSCC in order to assess whether gene
expression landscape is affected by tobacco smoking, having quit, or non-smoking 
status. We identified a set of differentially expressed genes that discriminate
between smokers and non-smokers or based on human papilloma virus (HPV)16 status,
or the co-occurrence of these two exposome components in HNSCC. Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways classification shows that most 
of the genes are specific to cellular metabolism, emphasizing metabolic
detoxification pathways, metabolism of chemical carcinogenesis, or drug
metabolism. In the case of HPV16-positive patients it has been demonstrated that 
the altered genes are related to cellular adhesion and inflammation. The
correlation between smoking and the survival rate was not statistically
significant. This emphasizes the importance of the complex environmental exposure
and genetic factors in order to establish prevention assays and personalized care
system for HNSCC, with the potential for being extended to other cancer types.
