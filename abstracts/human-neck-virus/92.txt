Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive neoplasm exclusively occurring in
AIDS patients. Recently, increasing cases of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-negative PBL have been reported. No standard therapy protocol is currently 
available since there is a great difference between PBL with and without HIV
infection. Here, we present a rather rare case of HIV-negative PBL in the neck
that dramatically responded to radiotherapy alone. Our case highlights the
possibility of PBL in the neck and helps to expand our understanding of this
separate lymphoma. The related literature review summarized the
clinicopathological features and treatment status of HIV-negative PBL.
