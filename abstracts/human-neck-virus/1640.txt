Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix and oral cavity are most
common cancers in India. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) overexpression
is one of the hallmarks for cancer, and activation through promoter mutation
C228T and C250T has been reported in variety of tumors and often shown to be
associated with aggressive tumors. In the present study, we analyzed these two
hot spot mutations in 181 primary tumors of the uterine cervix and oral cavity by
direct DNA sequencing and correlated with patient's clinicopathological
characteristics. We found relatively high frequency of TERT hot spot mutations in
both cervical [21.4 % (30/140)] and oral [31.7 % (13/41)] squamous cell
carcinomas. In cervical cancer, TERT promoter mutations were more prevalent
(25 %) in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cases compared to HPV-positive
cases (20.6 %), and both TERT promoter mutation and HPV infection were more
commonly observed in advanced stage tumors (77 %). Similarly, the poor and
moderately differentiated tumors of the uterine cervix had both the TERT hot spot
mutations and HPV (16 and 18) at higher frequency (95.7 %). Interestingly, we
observed eight homozygous mutations (six 228TT and two 250TT) only in cervical
tumors, and all of them were found to be positive for high-risk HPV. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting high prevalence of
TERT promoter mutations in primary tumors of the uterine cervix and oral cavity. 
Our results suggest that TERT reactivation through promoter mutation either alone
or in association with the HPV oncogenes (E6 and E7) could play an important role
in the carcinogenesis of cervical and oral cancers.
