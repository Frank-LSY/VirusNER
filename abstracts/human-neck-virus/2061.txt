PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in multimodality therapy, the overall 5-year 
survival rate is 40-50% in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) and current multimodality approaches impart significant toxicities. This 
review highlights promising targets with the potential to improve clinical
outcomes in HNSCC.
RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to mutagenic exposure to tobacco and alcohol as risk
factors, recent studies have shown that human papillomavirus is one of the main
causes of HNSCC and as such is being investigated as a therapeutic target.
Furthermore, recent data generated from whole exome sequencing of HNSCC, new
insights into the biology of DNA damage repair, and increased understanding of
tumor hypoxia responses are pointing to new therapeutic possibilities for
treating HNSCC.
SUMMARY: HNSCC is a heterogeneous disease. Improved treatment will require a
rapid translation of basic science research, and the simultaneous development of 
novel therapeutics and corresponding biomarkers to guide their application.
