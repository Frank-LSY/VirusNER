SUMMARY: Eighty-one percent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
patients had one or more of seven evaluated causes of secondary osteoporosis, and
this rate increases with age. The type and number of causes were associated with 
a lower bone mineral density (BMD), and with an increased rate of
osteopenia/osteoporosis, regardless of age and body mass index.
INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine whether factors of
secondary osteoporosis were associated with lower BMD in HIV.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 285 HIV-infected patients (25 %
females) evaluating the impact of seven different factors of reduced BMD:
hyperthyroidism, diabetes, chronic viral hepatitis, chronic kidney disease (CKD),
hypovitaminosis D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and hypogonadism. Dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry scan of the femoral neck was obtained at the clinical visit.
RESULTS: Mean age was 45.7 years; osteopenia and osteoporosis were diagnosed in
38 and 6 %, respectively. Overall, 230 patients (81 %) had secondary factors; 107
(38 %) had only 1 cause, 94 (33 %) had 2, and 28 (10 %) had 3 or more,
predominantly vitamin D deficiency in 61 %, hepatitis C virus coinfection in 45
%, and secondary hyperparathyroidism in 27 %. The number of secondary factors was
closely related to a lower BMD, which is statistically significant for patients
having ≥2 causes (0.77 vs 0.73 g/cm(2), p = 0.02). The rate of osteopenia ranged 
from 36 % without any cause to 57 % with three or more, osteoporosis from 0 to 19
%, and Z-score <-2 SD from 0 to 27 %, respectively. In a multivariate linear
regression, adjusting by age, body mass index, and HIV-related factors, the
number of secondary factors was independently associated with a lower BMD (ß
coefficient -0.134; p = 0.02), mainly due to patients with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) coinfection, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of secondary causes of osteoporosis is observed in
HIV-infected patients, and its type and cumulative number determine a lower BMD, 
after adjusting by age and body mass index.
