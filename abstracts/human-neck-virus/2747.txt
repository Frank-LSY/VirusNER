BACKGROUND: Treatment for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has
changed, as the proportion of human papilloma virus (HPV)-related disease has
increased. We evaluated nationwide information on its management and outcome
during the treatment paradigm change period.
METHODS: We included all patients diagnosed and treated for OPSCC at the five
Finnish university hospitals from 2000 to 2009. Patient records and pathology
registries provided the clinicopathological data. p16 staining was performed on
primary tumor samples of patients who had received treatment with curative
intent.
RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were diagnosed and treated for OPSCC and the
incidence increased along the study period. Of the evaluable tumors 58.5% were
p16-positive and the number of p16-positive tumors increased along the years. The
treatment was given with curative intent for 600 patients and it was completed in
564. Of them, 47.9% underwent primary surgery and 52.1% received definitive
oncological treatment. Also, the treatment protocol changed towards a more
oncological approach. Among patients treated with curative intent the five-year
overall, disease-specific and disease-free survival rates were 60.1, 71.5 and
57.0%. In multivariate analysis, p16-positivity seemed to relate to reduced
disease mortality in lateral and anterior-wall disease. Depending on primary
tumor localization, also sex, classes T3-4, presence of regional metastasis and
radiotherapy modality had an association with disease mortality.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of p16-positive OPSCC and delivery of definitive
oncological treatment increased in Finland during the study period. An improved
survival outcome compared with the previous nationwide investigation was observed
in this subset of patients.
