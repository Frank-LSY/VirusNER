OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the molecular carcinogenesis of oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) in young adult patients. The aim of this study was to
investigate the detailed TP53 mutation and human papilloma virus (HPV) status of 
OSCC in patients, younger than 45 years.
METHODS: TP53 mutations were determined with direct sequencing on
paraffin-embedded carcinoma tissue from 31 young patients and compared with two
older age OSCC reference groups: one from the same institute (N = 87) and an
independent one (N = 675). Biologically active tumour HPV was detected by
p16-immunohistochemistry followed by a HPV-DNA GP5 + /6 + -PCR.
RESULTS: HPV16 was present in one OSCC (3%). TP53 mutations were found in 14
(45%) OSCC: five were missense and nine resulted in a truncated protein. Six of
these latter were insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides leading to
frameshift, one was at a splice site and two resulted in a stop codon. The
percentage of truncating mutations (64% of all mutations) was higher than that
observed in the institute's reference group (44%, P = 0.23) and in the
independent reference group (24%, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TP53 mutations are common in OSCC of young
adult patients; infection with biologically active HPV is rare.
