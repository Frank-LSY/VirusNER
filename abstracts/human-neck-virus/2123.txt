Collagen lysyl hydroxylases (LH1-3) are Fe2+- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent
oxygenases that maintain extracellular matrix homeostasis. High LH2 levels cause 
stable collagen cross-link accumulations that promote fibrosis and cancer
progression. However, developing LH antagonists will require structural insights.
Here, we report a 2 Å crystal structure and X-ray scattering on dimer assemblies 
for the LH domain of L230 in Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus. Loop residues in
the double-stranded β-helix core generate a tail-to-tail dimer. A stabilizing
hydrophobic leucine locks into an aromatic tyrosine-pocket on the opposite
subunit. An active site triad coordinates Fe2+. The two active sites flank a deep
surface cleft that suggest dimerization creates a collagen-binding site. Loss of 
Fe2+-binding disrupts the dimer. Dimer disruption and charge reversal in the
cleft increase Km and reduce LH activity. Ectopic L230 expression in tumors
promotes collagen cross-linking and metastasis. These insights suggest inhibitor 
targets for fibrosis and cancer.
