Human papillomaviruses (HPV) require the activation of the DNA damage response
(DDR) in order to undergo a successful life cycle. This activation presents a
challenge for the virus and the infected cell: how does viral and host
replication proceed in the presence of a DDR that ordinarily arrests replication;
and how do HPV16 infected cells retain the ability to proliferate in the presence
of a DDR that ordinarily arrests the cell cycle? This raises a further question: 
why do HPV activate the DDR? The answers to these questions are only partially
understood; a full understanding could identify novel therapeutic strategies to
target HPV cancers. Here, we propose that the rapid replication of an 8 kb double
stranded circular genome during infection creates aberrant DNA structures that
attract and activate DDR proteins. Therefore, HPV replication in the presence of 
an active DDR is a necessity for a successful viral life cycle in order to
resolve these DNA structures on viral genomes; without an active DDR, successful 
replication of the viral genome would not proceed. We discuss the essential role 
of TopBP1 in this process and also how viral and cellular replication proceeds in
HPV infected cells in the presence of DDR signals.
