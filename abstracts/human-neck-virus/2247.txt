Head and neck malignancies comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies that
cause significant morbidity to those affected. These malignancies are associated 
with specific risk factors and exposures, some of which impact prognosis. The
most common risk factors for developing head and neck cancers are tobacco and
alcohol use. Marijuana and e-cigarettes, occupational exposures, and use of
topical substances have also been linked to head and neck cancers. Human
papilloma virus has been associated with oropharyngeal cancer. Such measures as
oral hygiene, screening, smoking cessation, and vaccination are measures taken to
decrease the incidence and morbidity of head and neck cancers.
