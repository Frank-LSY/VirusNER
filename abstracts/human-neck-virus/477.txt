At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, NDV(F3aa)-GFP infection of 3 cell lines supported strong GFP expression by 36 hours. Four cell lines were highly sensitivite to viral cytotoxicity, with >75% of cells lysed by day 6 at MOI 0.1, and 2 other cell lines were partially susceptible. Murine SCC25 flank tumors exhibited robust GFP expression after a single intratumoral viral injection and showed near-complete tumor regression over 34 days. There were no adverse effects attributable to therapy.
