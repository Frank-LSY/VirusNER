OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the safety and effectiveness of pediatric
tympanoplasty performed on short-term international medical missions.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
METHODS: Ethiopian children who had dry or nearly dry tympanic perforations and
bilateral conductive hearing losses underwent postauricular tympanoplasties with 
underlain temporalis fascia grafts. Pre- and postoperative air and bone
audiometry was performed. Complications, graft success, hearing improvement, and 
dry ear at 6-month follow-up were evaluated.
RESULTS: Patients were 7 to 25 years old (24 female ears, 20 male ears). The
majority had subtotal perforations. Operative findings included ossicular
erosions and fixation by hypertrophic mucosa. There were no major medical
complications or deaths in this series. Of 44 ears, 27 had complete pre- and
postoperative audiometric data. Twenty-four of 44 surgeries resulted in an intact
tympanic membrane. Twelve of 44 markedly reduced the perforation. Eight of 44
grafts failed. The mean improvement in PTA was 14 dB (range = -6-45 dB). Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ patients had a high rate of graft failure (3/4) and
comprised 38% (3/8) of complete graft failures (P = .015). Among the 20 ears with
residual perforations, 14 were dry at 6-month follow-up. Of the six ears with
drainage, three were HIV+ (P = .019).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric tympanoplasty is a safe procedure in a short-term surgical
mission setting when high anesthetic and surgical standards are maintained.
Surgical results were similar to those found in developing-world university
hospitals, but were worse than in United States or European series. HIV+ children
did worse than their HIV-/unknown peers, with a high rate of graft failure and
persistent otorrhea.
