A 35-year-old male who had not previously suffered any major illnesses was
admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue, fever, headache, vomiting,
consciousness disturbance, and seizures. A neurological examination showed that
he was in a semi-comatose state and exhibited neck stiffness. Brain magnetic
resonance imaging detected high-intensity areas in the bilateral hippocampi and
periventricular white matter. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed
mononuclear pleocytosis, an elevated protein level, and positivity for human
herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) DNA. The patient's condition improved after the
administration of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins, and acyclovir.
This is the first known case of limbic encephalitis associated with HHV-7 in an
immunocompetent Japanese adult.
