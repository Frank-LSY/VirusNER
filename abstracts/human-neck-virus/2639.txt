BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence demonstrating the role of human
trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) in cancer development and progression.
However, their prognostic value in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains to be elucidated.
METHOD: The prognostic significances of TROP2 and Ki-67 were determined by
immunohistochemistry in 58 NPC samples. TROP2 mRNA expression level and
biological functions were evaluated. The presence of EBV was assessed using in
situ hybridization. Analyses were conducted on the association between each of
these variables as well as clinical outcome.
RESULTS: TROP2 was exhibited over expression in 64% of NPC samples and
significantly associated with highly proliferative tumor cells (P = 0.05) and
lymph node metastases (P = 0.03). Overexpression of TROP2 significantly
correlated with worse overall survival (P = 0.026) and poor disease-free survival
(P = 0.021). By univariate analysis, high expression of TROP2 significantly
correlated with patients with distant metastases, Ki-67 and EBV infection.
Multivariate analysis further revealed that TROP2 along with Ki-67 and distant
metastasis are independent prognostic predictors for NPC patients.
CONCLUSION: Our findings have demonstrated that overexpression of TROP2 appears
to be an independent predictor for poor clinical outcome in NPC. The strong
correlation of overexpression of TROP2 with Ki-67 and distant metastases
indicates a potentially therapeutic strategies targeting TROP2 for NPC patients.
