HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human papillomavirus type 16
cause persistent infections that frequently precede cancer development. Virions
of these viruses are weak inducers of interferon-α and impair Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)9 function. Loss of TLR9 responsiveness also occurs in tumors without viral 
etiology such as breast, ovary, and head and neck carcinomas. Recent reports have
suggested that viruses and components of the tumor microenviroment interact with 
regulatory receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to impair TLR7 and
TLR9 signaling, and to downregulate TLR9 gene expression. The limited
responsiveness of pDCs might contribute to reduced innate immune responses during
chronic viral infections and oncogenesis, and represent a target for new
therapeutic approaches based on TLR agonists.
