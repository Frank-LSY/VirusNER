Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung
disease resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease in both children and
adults. Many physicians incorrectly diagnose PCD or eliminate PCD from their
differential diagnosis due to inexperience with diagnostic testing methods. Thus 
far, all therapies used for PCD are unproven through large clinical trials. This 
review article outlines consensus recommendations from PCD physicians in North
America who have been engaged in a PCD centered research consortium for the last 
10 years. These recommendations have been adopted by the governing board of the
PCD Foundation to provide guidance for PCD clinical centers for diagnostic
testing, monitoring, and appropriate short and long-term therapeutics in PCD
patients.
