RATIONALE: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium (PSCCE) is a rare
entity, and only sporadic cases have been reported in the literature since the
1st report in 1892. This report describes a case of a perimenopausal woman with
PSCCE.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old, human papilloma virus type 16-positive,
perimenopausal woman was admitted to our hospital with irregular vaginal bleeding
for 6 months and secondary anemia.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIc primary and moderately
differentiated endometrial squamous cell carcinoma.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent diagnostic curettage twice and cold knife
conization (CKC). Following this total abdominal hysterectomy combined with
bilateral adnexectomy and pelvic lymph node, dissection was performed. After the 
surgery, the patient was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Tumor
markers were followed up regularly after the operation to monitor tumor
recurrence and therapeutic effect.
OUTCOMES: Ninety-two days after the operation, there was tumor recurrence of the 
left pelvic cavity and the patient died after 11 months of follow-up.
LESSONS: Intrauterine pathology after the 1st diagnostic curettage suggests that 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion should make the clinician vigilant and
investigate the origin of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and tumor 
markers can be used to confirm the diagnosis as soon as possible and avoid
unnecessary interventions like CKC.
