The cranial suture complex is a heterogeneous tissue consisting of osteogenic
progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow and suture
mesenchyme. The fusion of cranial sutures is a highly coordinated and tightly
regulated process during development. Craniosynostosis is a congenital
malformation caused by premature fusion of cranial sutures. While the progenitor 
cells derived from the cranial suture complex should prove valuable for studying 
the molecular mechanisms underlying suture development and pathogenic premature
suture fusion, primary human cranial suture progenitors (SuPs) have limited life 
span and gradually lose osteoblastic ability over passages. To overcome technical
challenges in maintaining sufficient and long-term culture of SuPs for suture
biology studies, we establish and characterize the reversibly immortalized human 
cranial suture progenitors (iSuPs). Using a reversible immortalization system
expressing SV40 T flanked with FRT sites, we demonstrate that primary human
suture progenitor cells derived from the patent sutures of craniosynostosis
patients can be efficiently immortalized. The iSuPs maintain long-term
proliferative activity, express most of the consensus MSC markers and can
differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages upon BMP9 stimulation in
vitro and in vivo. The removal of SV40 T antigen by FLP recombinase results in a 
decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in the endogenous osteogenic and
adipogenic capability in the iSuPs. Therefore, the iSuPs should be a valuable
resource to study suture development, intramembranous ossification and the
pathogenesis of craniosynostosis, as well as to explore cranial bone tissue
engineering.
