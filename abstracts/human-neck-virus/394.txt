OBJECTIVE: Human-papillomaviruses (HPV) type 16 is a causative agent in an
increasing subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs). These
tumors have distinct oncogenic mechanisms and a more favorable prognosis than
tobacco-induced OPSCCs. Although these differences emphasize the need for a
specific therapeutic approach, HPV status is still not used to guide treatment. A
better characterization of the molecular profile related to HPV16-induced OPSCC
might help to develop personalized treatments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a human whole-genome DNA-microarray, we have examined
the gene expression profiles in 15 HPV-negative and 15 transcriptionally-active
HPV-positive OPSCCs. The study was conducted in two steps. Firstly, a
learning/training-set consisting of 8 HPV16-positive and 8 HPV16-negative OPSCCs 
was analyzed to identify a specific signature. Potentially confounding factors
(stage, sex and tobacco) were equally distributed in both groups. Subsequently
the robustness of this signature was confirmed by blind case-by-case
classification of a validation-set composed of the 14 remaining tumors.
RESULTS: We have identified a signature composed of 224 genes, which
discriminates HPV16-induced OPSCC from their HPV-negative counterparts. After the
blind classification of the 14 tumours, the viral status was revealed: 13 out of 
14 tumors were correctly classified according to tumor etiology, 1/14 was not
determined and none were misclassified. Several of the differentially expressed
genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication and repair,
transcription regulation, immune response and apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Our study contributes to a better understanding of pathogenic
mechanisms involved in the development of HPV-positive OPSCCs and in the
identification of potential therapeutic targets.
