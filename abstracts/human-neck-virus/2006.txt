BACKGROUND: Upfront surgery is a valuable treatment option for oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and risk stratification is emerging for treatment
de-escalation in human papillomavirus (HPV)-related OPSCC. Available prognostic
models are either based on selected, mainly non-surgically treated cohorts.
Therefore, we investigated unselected OPSCC treated with predominantly upfront
surgery.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with OPSCC and treated with curative intent
between 2000 and 2009 (n=359) were included. HPV association was determined by
HPV-DNA detection and p16INK4a immunohistochemistry. Predictors with significant 
impact on overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis were included in recursive
partitioning analysis.
RESULTS: Risk models generated from non-surgically treated patients showed low
discrimination in our cohort. A new model developed for unselected patients
predominantly treated with upfront surgery separates low-, intermediate- and
high-risk patients with significant differences in 5-year OS (86%, 53% and 19%,
P<0.001, respectively). HPV status is the most important parameter followed by
T-stage in HPV-related and performance status in HPV-negative OPSCC. HPV status
and ECOG remained important parameters in risk models for patients treated with
or without surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of treatment strategies, HPV status is the strongest
predictor of survival in unselected OPSCC patients. The proposed risk models are 
suitable to discriminate risk groups in unselected OPSCC patients treated with
upfront surgery, which has substantial impact for design and interpretation of
de-escalation trials.
