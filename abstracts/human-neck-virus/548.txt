BACKGROUND/AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas. However, the causal role of HPV in carcinomas of the
parotid gland remains uncertain and less documented. This study aimed to
determine the potential implication of HPV in the development of benign and
malignant lesions of the parotid gland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded biopsies were obtained from 40 patients 
with benign parotid gland tumors and from 39 patients with parotid gland
carcinomas. The 79 samples were evaluated for the presence of HPV DNA using both 
GP5+/GP6+ consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and type-specific E6/E7 PCR
to detect 18 HPV types.
RESULTS: Our results showed a low prevalence of HPV, with only three HPV-positive
cases among the 40 benign tumors and one infected carcinoma in the malignant
population.
CONCLUSION: No association between the presence of HPV DNA and the development of
parotid gland tumors was found in our study.
