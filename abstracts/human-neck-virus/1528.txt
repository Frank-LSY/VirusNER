BACKGROUND: Although human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have been causally
linked to oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the potential role of
low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) types in the pathogenesis of this malignancy remains
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes and their 
prognostic significance in OSCC patients treated by radical surgery, either with 
or without adjuvant therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: We studied two non-overlapping OSCC cohorts for the periods
2005-2006 (2005 cohort, n = 204) and 2010-2011 (2010 cohort, n = 206).
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected, and the HPV genotype was
determined using PCR plus HPV blot tests. The primary study endpoint was the
prevalence of HPV genotypes. The secondary endpoints were the 2-year therapeutic 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV infections did not differ significantly in
the two study cohorts. However, the prevalence of LR-HPV was significantly higher
in the 2010 cohort than in the 2005 cohort (p = 0.002). The overall prevalence of
HPV infections was not significantly associated with the 2-year outcomes.
However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that LR-HPV infection was a predictor
of poor 2-year disease-free survival (p = 0.036, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1),
disease-specific survival (p = 0.014, HR = 3.8), and overall survival (p = 0.016,
HR = 3.2) in the subgroups of OSCC patients with poor differentiation, pN2 lymph 
node metastases, or extracapsular spread (n = 150).
CONCLUSIONS: LR-HPV infections may have an important role in determining the
clinical outcomes of certain OSCC patients bearing specific risk factors.
