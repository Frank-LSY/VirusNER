OBJECTIVE: Determine human papillomavirus (HPV) incidence in unknown primary
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCa) of the head and neck and assess if HPV status
influenced survival.
STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care center.
SUBJECTS: Patients with unknown primary SCCa despite a complete workup who
underwent neck dissection or excisional biopsy and postoperative comprehensive ± 
chemoradiotherapy between 2002 and 2009.
METHODS: HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16(INK4a)
immunohistochemistry (p16 IHC) were performed. Results were compared with
survival, age, race, gender, tobacco use, alcohol use, and nodal stage.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 88% were >10
pack year tobacco users. Twenty-eight percent were HPV-positive defined by both
p16+ and FISH+. Five-year overall survival was 66.7% in HPV-positive and 48.5% in
HPV-negative patients (P = .35). Similarly, 5-year disease-free survival rates
were 66.7% in HPV-positive and 48.5% in HPV-negative patients (P = .54). All 3
HPV-positive nonsmokers were survivors, but this was not significant because of
the small sample size (P > .05). No other characteristics were associated with
survival (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Twenty-eight percent of metastatic lymph nodes from occult primary
tumors were HPV positive. There was no survival difference associated with HPV
status. Most of the HPV-positive patients in this study were tobacco users who
had similar survival to HPV-negative patients, so caution should be used in
interpreting HPV status in these patients.
