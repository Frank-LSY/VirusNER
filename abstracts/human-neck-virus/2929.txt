As HIV-infected patients are living longer, non-AIDS-defining cancers are
increasing in number and now constitute the majority of cancers diagnosed in the 
HIV-infected population. The excess incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma and head and
neck and liver cancers has been increasing among HIV-infected individuals. Breast
and lung cancers appear to occur earlier in the HIV-infected population; Hodgkin 
lymphoma appears to have a later onset, reflecting the fact that most cases in
the HIV-infected population are related to Epstein-Barr virus infection, which is
generally seen in older rather than younger individuals. Mortality from Hodgkin
lymphoma and lung and prostate cancers is higher among HIV-infected individuals
than HIV-uninfected individuals. The greater risk of cancer in the HIV-infected
population may be due to a number of factors, including more rapid
immunosenescence. At a minimum, age- and sex-appropriate cancer screenings should
be performed in all HIV-infected patients, and patients should be counseled on
measures to reduce cancer risk. This article summarizes a presentation by Ronald 
T. Mitsuyasu, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in San
Francisco, California, in March 2013.
