OBJECTIVE: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an extremely rare pediatric malignancy
predominantly occurring in adolescent males. Its multifactorial pathogenesis is
most strongly associated with the exposure to Epstein-Barr virus in genetically
susceptible hosts. In younger patients, more aggressive biological behavior has
been observed, although the overall survival is better compared to adults. Due to
its rarity and nonspecific clinical presentation, the diagnosis in children is
often delayed and misinterpreted.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 16-year-old boy with stage IVB nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma. He presented with a painless palpable neck mass, nasal congestion and 
a history of occasional epistaxis and headaches. Four years after the completion 
of a multimodal treatment, the patient is in complete remission.
CONCLUSION: Although exceedingly rare, pediatricians should consider
nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the differential diagnosis of palpable neck masses,
especially in male adolescents. A multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis,
treatment, supportive care and follow-up is of utmost importance.
