Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, head, and neck cancers. We studied
483 patients at a youth clinic in Stockholm, Sweden, and found oral HPV
prevalence was 9.3% and significantly higher for female youth with than without
cervical HPV infection (p = 0.043). Most oral HPV types matched the co-occurring 
cervical types.
