The Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a rare clinical feature characterised by
perceptual disturbances including visual disturbances and distortion of the body 
image. This uncommon--but often easy to recognise--syndrome, to which children
seem particularly susceptible, can be defined in patients with Epstein Barr Virus
(EBV) infection. This report describes a 10-year-old child with a mild upper
airway obstruction and manifestations of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome
resulting from an acute EBV infection. Because meningo-encephalitis was
considered in the differential diagnosis, an MRI examination was performed under 
midazolam sedation, leading to a severe life-threatening upper airway
obstruction.
