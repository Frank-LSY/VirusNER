Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are closely linked to major human
malignancies, including cervical and head and neck cancers. It is widely assumed 
that HPV-positive cancer cells are under selection pressure to continuously
express the viral E6/E7 oncogenes, that their intracellular p53 levels are
reconstituted on E6/E7 repression, and that E6/E7 inhibition phenotypically
results in cellular senescence. Here we show that hypoxic conditions, as are
often found in subregions of cervical and head and neck cancers, enable
HPV-positive cancer cells to escape from these regulatory principles: E6/E7 is
efficiently repressed, yet, p53 levels do not increase. Moreover, E6/E7
repression under hypoxia does not result in cellular senescence, owing to
hypoxia-associated impaired mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling via 
the inhibitory REDD1/TSC2 axis. Instead, a reversible growth arrest is induced
that can be overcome by reoxygenation. Impairment of mTOR signaling also
interfered with the senescence response of hypoxic HPV-positive cancer cells
toward prosenescent chemotherapy in vitro. Collectively, these findings indicate 
that hypoxic HPV-positive cancer cells can induce a reversible state of dormancy,
with decreased viral antigen synthesis and increased therapeutic resistance, and 
may serve as reservoirs for tumor recurrence on reoxygenation.
