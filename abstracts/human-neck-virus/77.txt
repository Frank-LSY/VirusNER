The identified gene set for distinguishing head and neck cancer from head and neck normal, did not accurately discriminate the HPV specific patients with head and neck cancer from the head and neck normal group. Also, it was demonstrated that some HPV-positive (HPV+) head and neck cancer-specific genes may not be significant in HPV-negative (HPV-) head and neck cancer patients. The identified HPV specific gene sets showed good performance in validation datasets. The HPV+ head and neck cancer-specific gene set included various metabolism-related pathways, and the HPV- head and neck cancer-specific gene set included several pathways; fibroblast, collagen degradation, actin-binding, and actin cytoskeleton.
