BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate oral cancer in pregnant
women, a rare but therapeutically challenging patient subset.
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, an EMERSE search was used to 
identify all women treated at the University of Michigan from 1998 to 2010 with
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) during pregnancy. This identified 4
patients with tongue cancer. Biomarkers and human papillomavirus (HPV) were
assessed by immunohistochemistry and multiplex PCR/mass spectrometry,
respectively.
RESULTS: Two patients responded well to therapy and are alive more than 10 years 
after diagnosis; 2 patients died of disease. All tumors overexpressed EGFR and
Bcl-xL, 3 of 4 overexpressed c-Met, both tumors that progressed overexpressed
p53. All tumors were negative for HPV, p16, estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor, and HER-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of aggressive tumors (high EGFR, c-Met; high Bcl-xL-low
p53) did not correlate with outcome. Additional studies are needed to determine
whether perineural invasion, delay in diagnosis, and p53 overexpression are
factors in poor survival.
