Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16 and HPV18, can cause cancers in
diverse anatomical sites, including the anogenital and oropharyngeal (throat)
regions. Therefore, development of safe and clinically effective therapeutic
vaccines is an important goal. Herein, we show that a recombinant fusion protein 
of a humanized antibody to CD40 fused to HPV16.E6/7 (αCD40-HPV16.E6/7) can evoke 
HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in head-and-neck cancer
patients in vitro and in human CD40 transgenic (hCD40Tg) mice in vivo The
combination of αCD40-HPV16.E6/7 and poly(I:C) efficiently primed
HPV16.E6/7-specific T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, in hCD40Tg mice.
Inclusion of montanide enhanced HPV16.E6/7-specific CD4+, but not CD8+, T-cell
responses. Poly(I:C) plus αCD40-HPV16.E6/7 was sufficient to mount both
preventative and therapeutic immunity against TC-1 tumors in hCD40Tg mice,
significantly increasing the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8+ CTLs in the tumors,
but not in peripheral blood. In line with this, tumor volume inversely correlated
with the frequency of HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ T cells in tumors, but not in
blood. These data suggest that CD40-targeting vaccines for HPV-associated
malignancies can provide a highly immunogenic platform with a strong likelihood
of clinical benefit. Data from this study offer strong support for the
development of CD40-targeting vaccines for other cancers in the future. Cancer
