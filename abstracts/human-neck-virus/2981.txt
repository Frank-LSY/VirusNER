BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplantation no longer is considered a rare procedure.
After undergoing transplants, patients will require both routine and emergent
oral health care, and it can be provided safely in private dental offices.
Transplant recipients are immunosuppressed, and for this reason clinicians should
be alert for oral abnormalities in such patients.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old man with a history of cardiac transplant and
multiple medical comorbidities had unusual mucosal plaques, oral discomfort and
skin lesions. As a result of his compromised immune system, the clinical
presentation of his condition-which proved to be herpes zoster (HZ) virus, also
called "shingles"-was atypical, resulting in a delay of the definitive diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: and
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: HZ is a serious infection in the immunocompromised
population. Timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition is necessary to
prevent treatment delay and medication errors.
