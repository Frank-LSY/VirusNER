AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas
(OPSCC) show better prognosis and response to therapy. We evaluated HPV-DNA
prevalence, p16 overexpression and HPV-attributable fraction in recent
consecutive OPSCCs.
MATERIALS & METHODS: 140 OPSCCs were analyzed for HPV-DNA using the INNO-LiPA
assay and p16 overexpression using CINtec® Histology kit.
RESULTS: HPV-DNA prevalence was 40.7%, and was significantly higher in basaloid
and nonkeratinizing SCCs, but similar in tonsillar and base of tongue SCCs.
Moreover, 98.0% of the HPV-positive OPSCCs overexpressed p16, compared with 12.3%
of the HPV-negative cases (p < 0.0001). Based on HPV-DNA and p16 double
positivity, 39.8% of the cases were HPV related.
CONCLUSION: The high estimate of the HPV-attributable fraction suggests that a
substantial proportion of OPSCC patients may be managed less intensively.
