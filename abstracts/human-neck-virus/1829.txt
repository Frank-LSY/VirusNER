Recently, we demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between HPV-infection
and SLPI-expression suggesting that SLPI protects against HPV-infection of HNSCC.
Here we analyzed in a single lab setting 307 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
HNSCC cases (tonsillar n = 135; non-tonsillar: n = 172) from eight health care
centers. Samples were analyzed for SLPI gene- and protein-expression. Annexin A2,
its heterotetramer A2t, putatively facilitating HPV- and SLPI-cell entry, was
measured to study the correlation between SLPI and annexin A2. Data were
correlated with tobacco consumption and HPV-status. Overall, HPV-DNA prevalence
was 23.5% (72/307); attributed to: 43.7% (59/135) tonsillar and 7.6% (13/172)
non-tonsillar cases. Smoking resulted in 6.44-fold increased and HPV-infection in
3.46-fold decreased SLPI-gene expression in all HNSCC with similar significant
results obtained in tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC separately. Correlating
annexin A2- and SLPI-gene expression showed a significant surplus of annexin A2
in HPV-positive tumors (4.21× more annexin A2) and 6.72× more annexin A2 than
SLPI in nonsmokers in all HNSCCs and similar significant results for both tumor
entities separately. The surplus of annexin A2 in non-smokers and HPV-positive
patients supports our hypothesis that decreased SLPI levels facilitate
HPV-infection i.e., increased SLPI-expression may protect against HPV-infection
of tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC.
