Patients with biopsy proven laryngeal papillomatosis were identified via chart review. All available pathology specimens were reviewed by a dedicated head and neck pathologist to confirm/refute the diagnosis of laryngeal dysplasia, and grade the level of dysplasia. Interrater agreement was compared using cross-tabulation methods. Specimens identified to be positive for dysplasia underwent further testing via in situ hybridization for low-risk (6/11) or high-risk (16/18) HPV subtypes.
