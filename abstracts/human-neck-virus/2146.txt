PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV)
status among patients treated by salvage radiation therapy for local-regional
recurrences and second primary cancers of the head and neck arising in a
previously irradiated field.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The medical records of 54 consecutive patients who
underwent re-irradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
occurring in a previously irradiated field were reviewed. Only patients with
biopsy-proven evidence of recurrent disease that had previously been treated with
doses of radiation therapy of at least 60 Gy were included. Determination of HPV 
status at the time of recurrence was performed by p16 immunohistochemistry. The
median age at re-irradiation was 58.5 years (range, 27.9 to 81.5 years). Thirty
patients (55.5%) were lifelong never-smokers. The Kaplan Meier method was used to
calculate overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional
control, and distant metastasis-free survival with comparisons between groups
performed using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: HPV status among tumors that were re-irradiated was as follows: 16
positive (29.7%); 7 negative (12.9%); 31 unknown (57.4%). The median overall
survival in the entire cohort was 11.7 months (range, 8 to 27 months), with the
1-year and 2-year estimates of overall survival being 47.2% and 38.4%,
respectively. A statistical trend was identified favoring patients with
HPV-positive cancers with respect to the endpoints of overall survival (p = 0.06)
and progression-free survival (p = 0.08) after re-irradiation when compared to
the HPV-negative/unknown population. There was no significant difference in
distant control between the two cohorts (p = 0.40).
CONCLUSIONS: The favorable prognostic significance of HPV seemingly extends to
patients treated by re-irradiation suggesting that this biomarker may be useful
in risk stratification in this setting.
