Clinical deterioration during the treatment of tuberculosis remains a diagnostic 
challenge. We describe the case of a 46-year-old man with a history of oral
cancer status after a radical operation who had pulmonary tuberculosis with
pleura and neck lymph node involvement. The clinical condition improved after
antituberculosis therapy. However, the patient suffered from low-grade fever,
progressive dyspnea, and cough after 7 weeks of the therapy. The findings of
chest plain films were relapse and progression of left lung haziness. The
deterioration was caused by disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection.
Disseminated P. marneffei in a non-HIV patient with tuberculosis is rarely seen, 
and the manifestations are similar to a paradoxical response and relapse of
pulmonary tuberculosis, thereby making it difficult to establish a diagnosis.
