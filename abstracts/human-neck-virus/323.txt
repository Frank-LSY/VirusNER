BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the development of
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been established for anogenital lesions but
still remains controversial for carcinomas in other sites. The aim of this study 
was to determine the α-HPV and β-HPV prevalence and their association with p16
expression, sun exposure, and clinicopathological findings in patients with
Bowen's disease (BD).
METHODS: One hundred sixty nine skin biopsy specimens from 157 immunocompetent
patients with extragenital/extraungual BD were examined for HPV status and p16
expression. The presence of koilocyte-like changes, solar elastosis and
papillomatosis was recorded for each specimen.
RESULTS: BD was diagnosed more often in potentially sun-exposed sites with
prevalence 73.6 % and a remarkable predilection for the head and neck region.
High risk α-HPV or β-HPV were detected in 34.7 % of lesions and β-HPV infections 
dominated over α-HPV. Higher prevalence of koilocyte-like changes and
papillomatosis was found in HPV-positive specimens but it was not statistically
significant. The expression of p16 was detected in 79.8 % of lesions and
displayed no correlation with the HPV status. HPV-positivity tended to be
detected more often in sun-protected sites. Dual infections by α-HPV/β-HPV genera
and mixed α-HPV infections were not detected, while 37.5 % of β-HPV positive
specimens were infected by two or more β-HPV genotypes. HPV 9 was significantly
associated with mixed β-HPV infections.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV may play an etiological role at least in some SCC in situ
arising in extragenital sites. Sunprotected sites may be more dependent on
HPV-mediated co-carcinogenesis than sun exposed areas. The presence of the
p16-expression, papillomatosis or koilocyte-like change is not a reliable marker 
of HPV infection in SCC in situ.
