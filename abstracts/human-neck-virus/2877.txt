This study quantified the risk of head and neck (HN) and esophageal cancers in
2770 Italian liver transplant (LT) recipients. A total of 186 post-transplant
cancers were diagnosed-including 32 cases of HN cancers and nine cases of
esophageal carcinoma. The 10-year cumulative risk for HN and esophageal carcinoma
was 2.59%. Overall, HN cancers were nearly fivefold more frequent in LT
recipients than expected (standardized incidence ratios - SIR=4.7, 95% CI:
3.2-6.6), while esophageal carcinoma was ninefold more frequent (SIR=9.1, 95% CI:
4.1-17.2). SIRs ranged from 11.8 in LT with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) to 1.8 
for LT without ALD for HN cancers, and from 23.7 to 2.9, respectively, for
esophageal carcinoma. Particularly elevated SIRs in LT with ALD were noted for
carcinomas of tongue (23.0) or larynx (13.7). Our findings confirmed and
quantified the large cancer excess risk in LT recipients with ALD. The risk
magnitude and the prevalence of ALD herein documented stress the need of timely
and specifically organized programs for the early diagnosis of cancer among LT
recipients, particularly for high-risk recipients like those with ALD.
