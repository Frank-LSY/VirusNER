EGFR inhibition and radiotherapy are potent inducers of DNA damage. Checkpoint
kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1/2) are critical regulators of the DNA-damage response,
controlling cell-cycle checkpoints that may permit recovery from
therapy-associated genomic stress. We hypothesized that Chk1/2 inhibition (CHKi) 
with prexasertib may enhance cytotoxicity from EGFR inhibition plus radiotherapy 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, we found that
the addition of CHKi to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab with and without
radiotherapy significantly decreased cell proliferation and survival fraction in 
human papillomavirus virus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines.
Reduced proliferation was accompanied by decreased checkpoint activation, induced
S-phase accumulation, persistent DNA damage, and increased caspase cleavage and
apoptosis. Importantly, a significant tumor growth delay was observed in vivo in 
both HPV-positive and HPV-negative cell line xenografts receiving triple
combination therapy with CHKi, cetuximab, and radiotherapy without a concomitant 
increase in toxicity as assessed by mouse body weight. Taken together, the
combination of CHKi with cetuximab plus irradiation displayed significant
antitumor effects in HNSCCs both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this
combination therapy may increase clinical benefit. A clinical trial to test this 
treatment for patients with head and neck cancer is currently ongoing
