OBJECTIVE: The rapid worldwide rise in incidence of human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has generated
studies confirming this disease as an entity distinct from traditional OPSCC.
Based on pathology, surgical studies have revealed prognosticators specific to
HPV-positive OPSCC. The current AJCC/UICC staging and pathologic nodal
(pN)-classification do not differentiate for survival, demonstrating the need for
new, HPV-specific OPSCC staging. The objective of this study was to define a
pathologic staging system specific to HPV-positive OPSCC.
METHODS: Data were assembled from a surgically-managed, p16-positive OPSCC cohort
(any T, any N, M0) of 704 patients from five cancer centers. Analysis was
performed for (a) the AJCC/UICC pathologic staging, (b) newly published clinical 
staging for non-surgically managed HPV-positive OPSCC, and (c) a novel,
pathology-based, "HPVpath" staging system that combines features of the primary
tumor and nodal metastases.
RESULTS: A combination of AJCC/UICC pT-classification and pathology-confirmed
metastatic node count (⩽4 versus ⩾5) yielded three groups: stages I (pT1-T2, ⩽4
nodes), II (pT1-T2, ⩾5 nodes; pT3-T4, ⩽4 nodes), and III (pT3-T4, ⩾5 nodes), with
incrementally worse prognosis (Kaplan-Meier overall survival of 90%, 84% and 48% 
respectively). Existing AJCC/UICC pathologic staging lacked prognostic
definition. Newly published HPV-specific clinical stagings from non-surgically
managed patients, although prognostic, showed lower precision for this surgically
managed cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Three loco-regional "HPVpath" stages are identifiable for
HPV-positive OPSCC, based on a combination of AJCC/UICC primary tumor
pT-classification and metastatic node count. A workable, pathologic staging
system is feasible to establish prognosis and guide adjuvant therapy decisions in
surgically-managed HPV-positive OPSCC.
