Ninety patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer were enrolled in the study. The presence of HPV DNA in pharyngeal superficial scrapes assessed by RT-PCR was compared to the HPV status in the tumor tissue samples determined by a combined RT-PCR/P16(INK4A) expression algorithm. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were calculated and the clinical outcome was analyzed in correlation to the HPV status.
