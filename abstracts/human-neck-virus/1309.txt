BACKGROUND: The benefit of combined chemoradiation in elderly patients with human
papillomavirus (HPV)-positive locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) must be balanced with the potential for higher toxicity rates. We
performed a retrospective review of our institutional experience.
METHODS: Patients 70 years or older with p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC treated
with definitive chemoradiation from 2005 to 2013 were evaluated. Overall survival
(OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional failure-free survival were
calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible patients had a follow-up of 22.4 months. Estimated
5-year OS, DFS, and locoregional failure-free survival were 76.0%, 40%, and 95%, 
respectively. There was 1 death from acute toxicity, and 50% had unplanned
hospitalizations. Sixty percent had late toxicity, and 6-month feeding tube
dependence was 25%.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with HPV-positive locally advanced SCC of the
oropharynx treated with definitive chemoradiation had good OS but high rates of
acute and long-term toxicity. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:
