BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Challenge tests involving chemical stimulation by
inhalation of capsaicin or citric acid are currently used to assess cough
sensitivity. We investigated the clinical usefulness of cough challenge tests
based on mechanical stimulation.
METHODS: A total of 347 patients (126 men and 221 women) were enrolled in the
study, including 161 patients with asthma, 116 with cough-variant asthma, 27 with
acute upper respiratory tract viral infections, 25 with acute bronchitis, four
with pneumonia, three with chronic bronchitis and 11 with cough of unknown
aetiology. Three modes of mechanical stimulation were assessed: the cervical
trachea was compressed softly with the fingers several times (tracheal
compression test); the trachea was stretched by retroflexion of the neck for 5 s 
(tracheal stretch test); and a vibrating tuning fork was placed on the cervical
trachea for 20 s (tuning fork test). The relationships between phonation-induced 
cough and the results of these tests were assessed.
RESULTS: The cough detection rate was 27.7% with the tracheal compression test,
39.8% with the tracheal stretch test and 36.9% with the tuning fork test. An
itchy sensation with or without cough was noted by about 50% of subjects
undergoing each of the tests. Provocation of cough and an itchy sensation during 
each test was significantly more frequent in subjects with phonation-induced
cough. Tests were usually negative after improvement of the cough with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical stimulation of the cervical trachea is a feasible cough
challenge test that may be useful for evaluating disease activity.
