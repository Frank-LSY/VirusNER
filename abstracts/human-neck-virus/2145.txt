OBJECTIVE: Discern inter- and intra-observer variability in the classification of
extracapsular extension (ECE) in p16+ oropharyngeal (OP) SCC comparing
pathologists' own criteria versus those of a well-defined classification system.
METHODS: Five pathologists reviewed 50 digitally scanned nodal metastasis slides 
in three Rounds. Round One was by their own criteria as ECE present or absent,
and Rounds Two and Three were with a defined ECE system: Grade 0 (no ECE), 0c (no
ECE - thick capsule; no infiltration), 1 (ECE - cells beyond capsule), and 2
(soft tissue metastasis - cells in soft tissue without residual node). Round
Three assessed intra-observer variability after an 8 month washout period.
RESULTS: In Round One, all five agreed on only 48% of cases (n=24). Fleiss's
Kappa value was 0.508 (95% CI: 0.357-0.644). For Rounds Two and Three, Grades 0
and 0c and Grades 1 and 2 were separately grouped as ECE absent or present. In
Round Two, all five agreed on 68% of cases (n=34). Fleiss' Kappa was 0.635 (95%
CI: 0.472-0.783), indicating statistically significantly better agreement. In
Round Three, all five agreed on 64% of cases (n=32) giving a Fleiss's Kappa of
0.639. Pathologists agreed with their prior reads in approximately 90% of cases
(average n=45.4, range n=42-49), an average intra-observer Cohen's Kappa of 0.8
(range: 0.68-0.95). Inter- and intra-observer variability rates for
classification of soft tissue metastasis (ECE2) were substantially worse.
CONCLUSION: There is substantial inter-, and modest intra-, observer variability 
among head and neck pathologists for ECE in p16+ OPSCC, which is modestly
improved by a defined system.
