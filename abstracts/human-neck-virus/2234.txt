BACKGROUND: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model has become a new approach
in identifying druggable tumor mutations, screening and evaluating personalized
cancer drugs based on the mutated targets.
METHODS: We established five nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) PDXs in mouse model. 
Subsequently, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and genomic mutation analyses were
performed to search for genetic alterations for new drug targets. Potential drugs
were applied in two NPC PDX mice model to assess their anti-cancer activities.
RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were performed in one NPC PDX mice to 
correlate with the efficacy of the anti-cancer drugs.
RESULTS: A relative high incident rate of copy number variations (CNVs) of cell
cycle-associated genes. Among the five NPC-PDXs, three had cyclin D1 (CCND1)
amplification while four had cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A deletion.
Furthermore, CCND1 overexpression was observed in >â€‰90% FFPE clinical metastatic 
NPC tumors (87/91) and was associated with poor outcomes. CNV analysis disclosed 
that plasma CCND1/CDKN2A ratio is correlated with EBV DNA load in NPC patients'
plasma and could serve as a screening test to select potential CDK4/6 inhibitor
treatment candidates. Based on our NPC PDX model and RNA sequencing, Palbociclib,
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, proved to have anti-tumor effects by
inducing G1 arrest. One NPC patient with liver metastatic was treated with
Palbociclib, had stable disease response and a drop in Epstein Barr virus (EBV)
EBV titer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated information of sequencing-based genomic studies and
tumor transcriptomes with drug treatment in NPC-PDX models provided guidelines
for personalized precision treatments and revealed a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor Palbociclib as a novel candidate drug for NPC.
