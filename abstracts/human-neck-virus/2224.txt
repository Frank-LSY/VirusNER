Head & Neck Cancer (HNC) represents the sixth most common malignancy worldwide
and it is historically linked to well-known behavioural risk factors, i.e.,
tobacco smoking and/or the alcohol consumption. Recently, substantial evidence
has been mounting that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is playing an
increasing important role in oral cancer. Because of the attention and clamor
surrounding oral HPV infection and related cancers, as well as the use of HPV
prophylactic vaccines, in this invited perspective the authors raise some
questions and review some controversial issues on HPV infection and its role in
HNC, with a particular focus on oral squamous cell carcinoma. The problematic
definition and classification of HNC will be discussed, together with the
characteristics of oral infection with oncogenic HPV types, the frequency of HPV 
DNA detection in HNC, the location of HPV-related tumours, the severity and
prognosis of HPV-positive HNC, the diagnosis of oral HPV infection, common routes
of oral infection and the likelihood of oro-genital HPV transmission, the
prevention of HPV infection and novel therapeutic approaches.
