BACKGROUND: Subjects with elevated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin A
(IgA) titers have a higher risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
indicating that reactivation of EBV in the local mucosa might be important for
NPC carcinogenesis. Cigarette smoking appears to be one of the environmental risk
factors for NPC. However, it remains unclear whether smoking-induced
nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis acts through reactivating EBV in the nasopharyngeal
mucosa. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between
cigarette smoking and nasopharyngeal EBV reactivation in a NPC high-risk
population.
METHODS: A NPC high-risk cohort study, established from a population-based NPC
screening program of 22,816 subjects, consisted of 1045 subjects with elevated
serum IgA antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA/IgA). Among high-risk 
subjects, information on detailed cigarette smoking history was collected among
313 male subjects. The associations between cigarette smoking and EBV antibody
levels, EBV DNA load of the nasopharynx were analyzed.
RESULTS: No significant association was observed between either nasopharyngeal
EBV DNA load or serum VCA/IgA titers and smoking status, age at smoking
initiation, daily smoking intensity, smoking duration, cigarette type, or
pack-years of smoking. Cigarette smoking characteristics in all subgroups did not
correlate with nasopharyngeal EBV DNA positivity or EBV VCA/IgA seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In a population at high risk of NPC, our study suggests that
cigarette smoking is neither associated with nasopharyngeal EBV DNA load nor
serum VCA/IgA antibody level. Smoking-associated NPC carcinogenesis may act
through other mechanisms than reactivating nasopharyngeal EBV replication.
