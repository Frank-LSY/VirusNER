OBJECTIVES: The importance of detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has resulted in a growing expectation for
HPV testing of clinical samples. Although testing protocols vary, most pertain to
primary tumor biopsies/resections. Testing of fine-needle aspirates and core
biopsies (FNACBs) is advantageous, but it is unclear whether technical and
biological factors adversely affect the fidelity of HPV detection in these
samples.
METHODS: Data was collected for 85 patients with regionally metastatic HNSCC that
had undergone FNACB with HPV analysis as part of clinical care. HPV testing
consisted of p16 immunostaining and HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). The FNACBs
were compared with the subsequent biopsies/resections for HPV status.
RESULTS: p16 staining was present in 60 cases (71%). p16 positivity was
predictive of oropharyngeal origin (p<0.001) and correlated with the presence of 
HPV by ISH (98% correlation). On comparison of the metastases and primary
cancers, the HPV status was concordant in 58 of 59 cases (98%).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with metastatic HNSCC, p16 staining reliably reflects
the HPV status of the primary tumor. p16 staining of FNACBs may obviate the need 
for more invasive sampling of the primary cancer solely for the purpose of HPV
testing.
