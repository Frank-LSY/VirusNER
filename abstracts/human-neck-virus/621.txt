Cytologic preparations (fine-needle aspirates [FNAs] and brushes) were obtained from surgically resected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of high-risk HPV using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. HPV analysis was also performed on the corresponding tissue sections using HPV in situ hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry. In cases in which the immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization results were discordant, HPV status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction detection of E7 expression. HPV status in the tissues and corresponding cytologic samples was compared.
