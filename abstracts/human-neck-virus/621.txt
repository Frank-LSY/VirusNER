PURPOSE: HPV status and smoking history stratifies patients into 3 distinct risk 
groups for survival following definitive chemoradiotherapy. Local-regional
recurrences are common patterns of failure across all 3 risk-groups.
SBRT±cetuximab has emerged as a promising salvage strategy for unresectable
locally-recurrent, previously-irradiated head-and-neck cancer (rHNC) relative to 
conventional re-irradiation±chemotherapy. However the influence of HPV and
smoking remains unknown in the setting of re-irradiation.
METHODS/MATERIALS: Patients (n=30) with rHNC of the oropharynx salvaged with
SBRT±cetuximab from August 2002 through August 2013 were retrospectively
reviewed; HPV status was determined based on p16 staining of primary pathology.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 10months for surviving patients, the mean
overall survival for all patients was 12.6 months. HPV positivity was a
significant predictor of overall survival (13.6 vs. 6.88 months, p=0.024), while 
smoking status did not significantly impact overall survival (p=0.707).
CONCLUSION: HPV status remains a significant predictor of overall survival in the
re-irradiation setting with HPV positive rHNC demonstrating superior overall
survival following salvage SBRT±cetuximab.
