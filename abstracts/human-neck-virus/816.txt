A significant proportion of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the oropharynx are 
associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). These HPV-related
carcinomas are prognostically and therapeutically different from traditional SCC 
of the head and neck. Cervical metastases from head and neck primary SCC are
frequently investigated by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). HPV testing of cytologic
samples from these lesions would potentially simplify diagnosis and therapeutic
planning. This review summarizes current methodologies for HPV testing of FNA
specimens and the role of HPV typing in diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and
selection of therapy.
