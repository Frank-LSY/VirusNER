OBJECTIVE: To construct the co-expressing lentivirus vector of human
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) beta and green fluorescent protein (GFP).
METHOD: cDNA encoding hGRbeta obtained from the expression library of fetal brain
using gene recombinant technology was cloned into pGC-LV by double digests
technology. The constructed lentivirus vector of pGC-FU-GRbeta that was confirmed
the sequencing was correct, transfected 293T cells through lipofectamine 2000.
The constructed lentivirus vector was identified by fluorescence detection and
Western Blot method. The packed lentivirus vector was used to infect 293T cells. 
The titer of virus was tested by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULT: A recombinant lentivirus vector co-expressing hGRbeta and GFP gene was
constructed successfully. After transfection, a large number of 293T cells with
green fluorescence were observed under fluorescent microscope, and the expression
of GRbeta and GFP fusion protein was detected by Western Blot. The virus titer
was 2.00E+8 TU/ml tested by Real-time PCR.
CONCLUSION: Successful construction of hGRbeta and GFP co-expressing lentivirus
vector provides a stable vector for investigating the relationship between GRbeta
and hormonal sensitivity or resistance in the therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis
whose choice drug are glucocorticoids.
