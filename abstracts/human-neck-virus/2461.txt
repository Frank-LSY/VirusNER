Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common infection in kidney transplant recipients.
HPV causes cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile and head and neck cancers.
Kidney transplant recipients have a disproportionate burden of disease given
prolonged immunosuppression. Given the long pre-invasive state of precancer
lesions such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and anal intraepithelial
neoplasia (AIN) most HPV-cancers are preventable with screening and targeted
treatment of disease. Pre-transplant vaccination of age-eligible kidney
transplant recipients is otherwise ideal.
