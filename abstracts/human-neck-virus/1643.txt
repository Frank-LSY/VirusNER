OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We review the use of topical chemoprevention agents in
patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (PMD).
METHODS: A systematic review of studies on topical chemoprevention agents for
oral PMD from 1946 to November 2016 was conducted using the MEDLINE database,
Embase, and Cochrane Library. Data were extracted and analyzed from selected
studies including study type, sample size, demographics, treatment length,
response rate, follow-up time, adverse effects, and recurrence.
RESULTS: Of 108 studies, twenty-four, representing 679 cases met the inclusion
criteria. The clinical lesions evaluated included oral leukoplakia, erythroplakia
(OEL), verrucous hyperplasia (OVH), oral lichen planus, larynx squamous cell
carcinoma, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The mean complete response
rate for topical retinoid therapy was 32%. The mean complete response rate for 1%
bleomycin therapy and 0.5% bleomycin was 40.2% and 25%, respectively. The
complete response rate of OVH, OEL, and OSCC to photodynamic therapy ranged from 
66.7% to 100%.
CONCLUSION: There are a paucity of data examining topical treatment of oral PMDs.
However, the use of topical agents among patients with oral lesions may be a
viable complement or even alternative to traditional surgery, radiation, or
systemic chemotherapy, with the advantage of reducing systemic side effects and
sparing important anatomic structures. This study of 679 cases represents the
largest pooled sample size to date, and the preliminary studies in this
systematic review provide support for further inquiry.
