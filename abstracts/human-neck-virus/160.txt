BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that high-risk human papilloma virus
(HPV) is involved in cancers in addition to cervical cancer. For example, it is
generally accepted that HPV has a role in a significant proportion of head and
neck tumours, and it has long been hypothesised that hormone dependent oncogenic 
viruses, such as HPV may have causal roles in some human breast cancers. A number
of reports have identified HPV DNA in breast tissue and breast cancer specimens, 
but these rely on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is criticised
for its propensity for contamination.
METHODS: We have used two different technologies, in situ and standard PCR (with 
sequencing), and histology based on light microscopy.
RESULTS: We unambiguously demonstrate the presence of high-risk HPV in the cells 
of breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we also
show that the oncogenic characteristics of HPV associated breast cancer are very 
similar to HPV-associated cervical cancer. Specifically, that putative koilocytes
are present in some HPV associated breast cancers.
INTERPRETATION: The above observations indicate a likely causal role for
high-risk HPV in human breast cancer and offer the possibility of primary
prevention of some breast cancers by vaccination against HPV.
