Merkel cell carcinoma is an uncommon neuroendocrine carcinoma with a rising
incidence and an aggressive behavior. It predominantly occurs in older patients, 
with onset occurring at a mean age of 75-80 years. Recognized risk factors are
ultraviolet sunlight exposure, immunosuppression, and, more recently, Merkel cell
polyomavirus. We report a case of Merkel cell carcinoma in a young HIV positive
patient with Merkel Cell polyomavirus detected in the tumor.
