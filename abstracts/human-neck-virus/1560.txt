OBJECTIVES: To determine the prognostic utility of pathologic extracapsular
extension (ECE) in human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on patients who
underwent surgery for primary HPV-related OPSCC and received adjuvant
radiotherapy (RT) between 2006 and 2015. Locoregional control (LRC), distant
control (DC), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
compared between the groups with and without ECE using univariate Kaplan-Meier
and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses.
RESULTS: 75 patients were identified and ECE was demonstrated on the surgical
pathology of 26 patients. ECE(+) patients more frequently received chemotherapy
(76.9% vs. 32.7%; p<0.0001) and RT doses>66Gy (76.9% vs. 16.3%; p<0.001). With a 
median follow-up of 29months, patients with ECE had a significantly worse 5-year 
DC rate than those without ECE (76.7% vs. 97.9%; p=0.046), and patients with ECE 
had a significantly worse 5-year PFS (54.5% vs. 93.6%; p=0.021) than those
without ECE. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, ECE was independently
prognostic of worse DC (hazard ratio: 8.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.24-55.21; 
p=0.029) and worse PFS(HR: 4.64; 95% CI: 1.18-18.29; p=0.028). There was no
statistically significant difference in 5-year LRC (93.3% vs. 95.7%) or OS (66.9%
vs. 97.0%) between ECE(+) and ECE(-) patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ECE is independently prognostic of worse DC 
and PFS in patients who undergo surgery prior to adjuvant RT for primary
HPV-related OPSCC.
