CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high prevalence of human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive tonsillar tumours (52%). The survival of the HPV-positive group
was significantly better in males.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the prevalence of HPV in 137 patients with tonsillar
carcinomas, measured the p53- and Ki-67-positive tumour cell fractions and
correlated the results with clinical variables.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumour DNA from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of
the tonsillar region was amplified by PCR and sequenced for detection of HPV
subtypes.
RESULTS: HPV was found in 71/137 (52%) of the tumours; HPV-16 was the most
frequent subtype (87%). HPV positivity did not correlate with gender, stage, T-
and N categories, Ki-67 expression or p53 positivity. The HPV-positive group had 
a significantly better survival (p < 0.01) compared with the HPV-negative group
in males. In a multivariate analysis HPV status gave prognostic information in
addition to the earlier established factors, i.e. age, gender and stage (p <
0.05).
