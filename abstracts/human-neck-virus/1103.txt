CONTEXT: Tumors of the head and neck commonly arise from the squamous and
respiratory mucosa that lines the nasal and oral cavity, sinuses, pharynx, and
larynx. The rate of oropharyngeal cancers diagnosed among Americans younger than 
50 years is increasing. Infection of the oropharynx and tonsils by the human
papillomavirus (HPV) has been linked to preneoplasia and cancer.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test kit to
identify, and then specifically genotype, HPV in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues.
DESIGN: We evaluated the performance of this assay for accuracy, for intra-assay 
and interassay precision, and for its limit of detection, using materials with
known HPV status. Sixteen tumor tissues with the following origins were
evaluated: 1 ocular, 1 hypopharynx, 8 tonsil, 1 retromolar trigone, 3 tongue, 1
anal, and 1 lymph node. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections
was isolated and amplified in duplicate, with positive and negative controls,
using primers specific to the polymorphic L1 region of the HPV genome.
Thirty-seven genotypes were tested using the linear array. The amplified product 
(450 base pairs) was visualized by gel electrophoresis and, if positive, reflexed
to HPV genotyping.
RESULTS: Nine of the 16 tumors analyzed were HPV positive. The detected genotypes
included HPV 6, 16, and 69.
CONCLUSIONS: The Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test is an easy-to-use method 
for determining HPV genotype in the routine analysis of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumors. This assay is robust and can be performed routinely in 
a clinical laboratory setting.
