OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Mortality for black males with head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) is twice that of white males or females. Human papillomavirus
(HPV)-active HNSCC, defined by the concurrent presence of high-risk type HPV DNA 
and host cell p16(INK4a) expression, is associated with decreased mortality. We
hypothesized that prevalence of this HPV-active disease class would be lower in
black HNSCC patients compared to white patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective cohort analysis.
METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate for high-risk
HPV DNA presence. Immunohistochemistry for p16(INK4a) protein was used as a
surrogate marker for HPV oncoprotein activity. Patients were classified as
HPV-negative (HPV DNA-negative, p16(INK4a) low), HPV-inactive (HPV DNA-positive, 
p16(INK4a) low), and HPV-active (HPV DNA-positive, p16(INK4a) high). Overall
survival and recurrence rates were compared by Fisher exact test and Kaplan-Meier
analysis.
RESULTS: There were 140 patients with HNSCC who met inclusion criteria.
Self-reported ethnicity was white (115), black (25), and other (0). Amplifiable
DNA was recovered from 102/140 patients. The presence of HPV DNA and the level of
p16(INK4a) expression were determined, and the results were used to classify
these patients as HPV-negative (44), HPV-inactive (33), and HPV-active (25).
Patients with HPV-active HNSCC had improved overall 5-year survival (59.7%)
compared to HPV-negative and HPV-inactive patients (16.9%) (P = .003). Black
patients were less likely to have HPV-active disease (0%) compared to white
patients (21%) (P = .017).
CONCLUSIONS: The favorable HPV-active disease class is less common in black than 
in white patients with HNSCC, which appears to partially explain observed ethnic 
health disparities.
