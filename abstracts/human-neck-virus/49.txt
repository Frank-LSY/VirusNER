Oral cancer is the eleventh most common cancer globally, with well-established major risk factors of tobacco, areca nut, alcohol, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18. HR-HPV16/18 are the etiologic agents of cervical cancers and a proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. HPV-associated oropharyngeal and oral cancers show better prognosis and response to therapy. However, the picture of HR-HPV16/18 and the clinical implications of oral cancers are not clear with the majority of reports combining oral cancer data with head and neck cancers. The current review compiles the global prevalence of HR-HPV16/18 in oral cancers, highlighting the unique clinical and molecular pathologic features, prognosis and therapeutic strategies in the prevention and management of HPV-positive oral cancers. The potential for the use of de-intensified therapy and prophylactic prevention in HPV-positive oral cancer patients is highlighted.
