Viral loads of E7 oncogenes for HPV 16/18 were measured by quantitative PCR tests in paraffin-embedded lesional specimens from 312 OSCC of which the HPV genotypes had been determined previously. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent prognostic factors for 5-year DM and C statistics were further computed.
