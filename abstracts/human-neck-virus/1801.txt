Poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a major malignancy in
certain areas of Asia. It exists also in Africa, notably among largely Arab
populations in North Africa, and in "hotspots" in East Africa among "native"
Africans. This article deals with the latter, as studied and defined in depth
during the 1960s and 70s by the Irish-born surgeon, Peter Clifford. Through his
published works, he has influenced and helped define the field of head and neck
cancer as it exists in Kenya. He also did pioneering work on the African
childhood malignancy, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Both BL and NPC have been
ultimately shown to be associated with the human herpes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
This article is written as a tribute to Peter Clifford, focusing on his work on
NPC, where he first defined the disease "hotspots" in the Kenyan Highlands,
studied how best to treat the malignancy in the absence of radiotherapy, looked
at possible NPC predisposing factors in the Kenyan setting, and ultimately
addressed how the cancer cells interact with EBV. Peter Clifford's pioneering
work was cut short by accident. Although outside East Africa he remains largely
an 'unsung hero' in the field, his influence has been great. It begs to be
re-addressed and reconsidered.
