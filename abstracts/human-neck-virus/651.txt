BACKGROUND: Recent studies support a role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); however, the significance of HPV
in non-oropharyngeal head and neck cancers is uncertain. The aim of this study
was to determine the prevalence of HPV in a large cohort of laryngeal and
hypopharyngeal SCCs in northern Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records and paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of 
124 consecutive patients surgically treated for laryngeal (62 cases) and
hypopharyngeal (62 cases) SCCs between 2002 and 2007 were retrieved. All cases
were histologically evaluated, and presence of HPV was assessed by
p16-immunohistochemistry followed by GP5+/6+-PCR-based DNA detection. Samples
positive in both assays were subjected to HPV genotyping and HPV E6 transcript
analysis.
RESULTS: Seventeen cases (14%) were positive for p16 immunostaining, of which 2
(1 larynx, 1 hypopharynx, 1.6% of total series) were found positive for HPV DNA
by subsequent GP5+6+-PCR. Both SCCs contained HPV type 16 and showed HPV16 E6
mRNA expression.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV is only occasionally involved in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal
SCC patients in northern Spain.
