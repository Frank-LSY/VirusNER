Vaccines targeting infections with hepatitis B virus, a risk factor for
hepatocellular cancer, and human papillomavirus, a risk factor for cervical
cancer, are considered major clinical cancer chemoprevention successes.
Molecularly targeted agents can prevent breast cancer (raloxifene and tamoxifen),
colorectal adenomas (celecoxib), and prostate cancer (finasteride). Nevertheless,
the broad translation of chemoprevention to the clinic is not yet a reality.
Continuing research of molecular targets promises to expand the reach of
chemoprevention and to personalize it as well.
