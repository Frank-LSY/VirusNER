There is limited information regarding the incidence of p16 expression, its
association with human papillomavirus (HPV) and prognosis in oral cavity squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC). The role of p16 in OSCC is evaluated in 215 cases using
tissue microarrays (TMAs). p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridisation
were performed on TMAs following histopathology review of 215 patients with OSCC 
in the Sydney Head and Neck Cancer Institute database. Thirty-seven (17.2%) cases
showed p16 expression without association with HPV. p16 expression significantly 
decreased with increasing pT category (p=0.002). p16 expression was associated
with longer disease-specific survival on univariable analysis (p=0.044) but not
on multivariable analysis adjusting for depth of invasion. Amongst patients
receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, patients with p16 expression had significantly
longer disease-free and overall survival. p16 expression was seen in early stage 
OSCCs and was associated with better survival following surgery and radiotherapy.
While not an independent predictor of survival, p16 may mediate its effects by
contributing to reduced proliferative capacity, leading to smaller tumour size
and lower invasive potential.
