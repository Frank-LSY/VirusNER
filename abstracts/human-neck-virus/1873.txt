In this issue: targeting Human Papilloma Virus-associated disease, from cervical 
to head and neck carcinoma…and more.

Chiriva-Internati M, Kast WM, Bot A.

This issue of the International Reviews of Immunology hosts a diverse range of
topics, ranging from cancer immunotherapy, to severe combined immunodeficiency
syndromes in man and alternative treatments for autoimmunity. The emphasis of the
issue is on cervical and head and neck carcinoma, significantly related to Human 
Papilloma Viruses. While the development of anti-HPV prophylactic vaccines
represents one of the most remarkable triumphs of modern medicine, there is much 
more to be done in terms of advancing safe and effective treatments for cervical 
and head-and-neck cancers. We also host a review on congenital severe combined
immunodeficiencies, a field that allowed unprecedented insight into the
connection between the immune system, microbes, autoimmunity and cancer. Last but
not least, we host a review dedicated to critically analyzing alternative
treatments for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, as adjuncts to conventional therapies,
based on solid scientific evidence and complementary mechanism of action.
