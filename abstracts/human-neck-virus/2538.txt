BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid salivary duct carcinoma of the submandibular gland is
extremely rare. This paper highlights the impact of surgery and adjuvant
radiation therapy on the outcome of this disease.
METHODS: A 59-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus presented with a
painless, rapidly growing left neck mass. Biopsy followed by surgical excision of
the left submandibular gland revealed sarcomatoid salivary duct carcinoma of the 
submandibular gland duct with perineural invasion and close margins, for which he
underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. Post-operative positron emission tomography and 
computed tomography revealed no residual or metastatic disease. Pathological
analysis of tumour-node-metastasis staging revealed a T2 N0 M0 (stage II) tumour.
RESULTS: The patient tolerated his treatment without serious acute or long-term
side effects. There was no evidence of disease on comprehensive examination or on
positron emission tomography or computed tomography scans at the 4.6-year follow 
up.
CONCLUSION: Surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy provided practical
locoregional control with acceptable toxicity. Further detailed case reports are 
warranted to optimise the management of this rare malignancy.
