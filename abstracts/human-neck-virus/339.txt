To assess the association between sequence variants of human papillomavirus (HPV)
11 and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and the taxonomy and evolutionary
history of HPV 11. Complete HPV 11 nucleotide sequences were sequenced by
Illumina HiSeq2000 Analyzers and compared with the HPV 11 prototype isolate
(GenBank accession number: M14119) using Blast 2.0 server software. Eighteen
full-length HPV 11 genomic sequences were amplified and sequenced. A total of 49 
nucleotide mutations were identified, 12 of which resulted in amino acid changes.
HPV 11 variants were highly conserved; the maximum pairwise difference was
approximately 0.49%. The maximum pairwise difference of the 18 variants in our
research was 0.39%. HPV 11 is less polymorphic than the majority of studied HPV
genotypes.
