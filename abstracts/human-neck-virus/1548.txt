BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to characterize oncologic outcomes in
early (T1-T2, N0) and intermediate (T1-T2, N1) oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) after surgery.
METHODS: Patients with oropharyngeal SCC treated with surgery were identified
from 2 academic institutions.
RESULTS: Of 188 patients, 143 met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-six (60%) had T1
to T2 N0 and 57 (40%) had T1 to T2 N1 disease. Sixty-five patients (45%)
underwent a robotic-assisted resection, whereas the remaining had transoral (n = 
60; 42%), mandible-splitting (n = 11; 8%), or transhyoid approaches (n = 7; 5%). 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was known for 97 patients (68%), and 54 (55%)
were HPV positive. Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 82% (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-0.89). Since 2008, HPV infection was protective
of recurrence (log-rank p = .0334). A single node did not increase the risk of
recurrence (p = .467) or chance of a second primary (p = .175).
CONCLUSION: Complete surgical resection is effective therapy for early and
intermediate oropharyngeal SCC. HPV-negative patients were at increased risk for 
locoregional recurrence or second primary disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
