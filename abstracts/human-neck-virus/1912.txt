OBJECTIVES: This study identifies clinical characteristics associated with
HPV-positive oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and evaluates predictors 
of overall survival (OS) in HPV-positive patients undergoing definitive treatment
within the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The NCDB was queried for patients ⩾18years old with OPSCC
and known HPV status who underwent definitive treatment: surgery, radiation (RT),
chemotherapy-RT (CRT), surgery+RT, surgery+CRT (S-CRT). Cox proportional hazards 
model was used for multivariate analysis (MVA) to evaluate predictors of OS by
HPV status.
RESULTS: 3952 patients were included: 2454 (62%) were HPV-positive. Median follow
up was 23.7months (range, 1.0-54.5). Unadjusted 2-year OS rates for HPV-positive 
vs. negative were 93.1% vs. 77.8% (p<0.001) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.44
(95% CI, 0.36-0.53; p<0.001). MVA identified multimodality treatment including
CRT (HR, 0.42; p=0.024) and S-RT (HR, 0.30; p=0.024), but not S-CRT (HR, 0.51;
p=0.086), as predictors for improved OS in HPV-positive stage III-IVB disease.
Multimodality treatment including S-CRT was associated with longer OS in
HPV-negative OPSCC. Nodal stage was poorly associated with OS in HPV-positive
cancers. The presence of positive margins and/or extracapsular extension was
associated with worse OS in HPV-negative (HR, 2.11; p=0.008) but not HPV positive
OPSCC (HR, 1.61; p=0.154).
CONCLUSION: The established demographic and clinical features of HPV-positive
OPSCC were corroborated in the NCDB. Population analysis suggests that AJCC
staging is poorly associated with OS in HPV-positive cancer, and traditional
high-risk features may be less impactful. Bimodality therapy appears beneficial
in HPV-positive HNSCC.
