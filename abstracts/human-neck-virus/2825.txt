AIM: To explore in a prospective study the evidence of certain viral and
toxoplasmosis infections in sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL).
METHODS: 84 consecutive patients with SSHL meeting certain criteria. All patients
were assessed for specific IgM antibodies against cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex
virus, toxoplasma and Epstein-Barr virus. All were treated with intravenous
steroids and assigned to two groups: 76 IgM negative (NV group) and 8 IgM
positive (no history of acute infection - V group).
RESULTS: The mean hearing level at presentation was 86.5 dB HL (median, 100) in
the V group and 60.7 dB HL (median, 61) in the NV group. The difference was
statistically significant (p = 0.003). The mean hearing level following treatment
was 81.8 dB HL (median, 88) in the V group and 48.7 dB HL (median, 39) in the NV 
group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.004). There was a
considerable improvement in hearing after treatment only in the NV group (p <
0.000001).
CONCLUSIONS: Recent subclinical viral or toxoplasmosis infections may be involved
in the pathogenesis of SSHL (in approx. 10% of cases), suggesting that SSHL is
not a single disease. When certain viruses or toxoplasmoses are involved, the
hearing is much worse in comparison to patients with no such indication of
infection. An alteration in treatment dosage or method of steroid administration 
may be needed in such cases.
