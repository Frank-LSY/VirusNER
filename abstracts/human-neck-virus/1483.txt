BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer is
associated with favorable outcomes, prompting investigations into treatment
deintensification. The purpose of this study was for us to present the predictors
of distant metastases in patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated 
with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or cetuximab-based bioradiotherapy
(bio-RT).
METHODS: In patients with stage III to IVb HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, the
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate distant metastases rates. Univariate 
analysis (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) were used to identify factors
associated with distant metastases.
RESULTS: Increased distant metastases rates were noted in active smokers versus
never/former smokers (22% vs 5%), T4 vs T1 to T3 (15% vs 6%), and cetuximab-based
bio-RT versus CRT (23% vs 5%). All remained significant on MVA.
CONCLUSION: T4 tumors and active smokers have substantial rates of distant
metastases, and trials investigating intensified systemic therapies may be
considered. Higher rates of distant metastases observed with concurrent cetuximab
are hypothesis generating, but further data are needed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals,
