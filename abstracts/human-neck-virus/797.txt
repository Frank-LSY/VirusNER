BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer exhibits extensive interpatient and
intratumoral heterogeneity, which can hinder successful treatment strategies.
Herein, we investigated the efficacy of an emerging oncolytic, Maraba virus
(MRBV), in an in vitro model of ovarian tumour heterogeneity.
METHODS: Four ovarian high-grade serous cancer (HGSC) cell lines were isolated
and established from a single patient at four points during disease progression. 
Limiting-dilution subcloning generated seven additional subclone lines to assess 
intratumoral heterogeneity. MRBV entry and oncolytic efficacy were assessed among
all 11 cell lines. Low-density receptor (LDLR) expression, conditioned media
treatments and co-cultures were performed to determine factors impacting MRBV
oncolysis.
RESULTS: Temporal and intratumoral heterogeneity identified two subpopulations of
cells: one that was highly sensitive to MRBV, and another set which exhibited
1000-fold reduced susceptibility to MRBV-mediated oncolysis. We explored both
intracellular and extracellular mechanisms influencing sensitivity to MRBV and
identified that LDLR can partially mediate MRBV infection. LDLR expression,
however, was not the singular determinant of sensitivity to MRBV among the HGSC
cell lines and subclones. We verified that there were no apparent extracellular
factors, such as type I interferon responses, contributing to MRBV resistance.
However, direct cell-cell contact by co-culture of MRBV-resistant subclones with 
sensitive cells restored virus infection and oncolytic killing of mixed
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data is the first to demonstrate differential efficacy of an
oncolytic virus in the context of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity of HGSC
cells and to evaluate whether it will constitute a barrier to effective viral
oncolytic therapy.
