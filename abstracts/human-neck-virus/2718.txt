OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively investigate the clinicopathologic spectrum of
primary mucosal CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (PTCLDs) of
the head and neck.
STUDY DESIGN: Archives of PTCLDs primarily arising in head and neck mucosa were
reviewed. Immunostaining of CD20, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1,
granzyme B, or perforin), and Ki67; in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus;
and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen cases of primary mucosal anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(M-ALCL) were identified, and no lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) cases were found.
All cases demonstrated atypical mononuclear neoplastic cells with diverse
histology and cytomorphology. The typical immunophenotype of neoplastic cells was
CD3-positive, CD4-positive, CD8-negative, CD30-positive, ALK-negative, and
cytotoxic molecules-positive. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was common. All 
cases presented an indolent course, regardless of therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: PTCLDs of the head and neck provisionally included M-ALCL alone.
