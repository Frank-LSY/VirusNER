The Snail family of zinc finger transcription factors plays an important role in 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a variety of tissues and systems.
Slug (SNAI2) expression has been shown to directly contribute to a subset of
events required for EMT in events such as re-epithelialization during wound
healing and neural crest cell migration. In addition, slug expression was shown
to correlate with disease recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) patients. Based on this association we chose to specifically examine the 
effects of exogenous slug expression in HNSCC cells and specifically assess
adhesive junction assembly and the motility characteristics in these cells. Slug 
expression led to changes in adherens junction and desmosome assembly
characterized by a classical cadherin switch and loss of desmosome assembly.
Additionally, we performed gene expression profiling to identify novel slug
dependent gene expression changes in a HNSCC cell line. In addition to genes
known to be altered during EMT, we identified a novel set of Slug responsive
genes that will provide a better understanding of slug overexpression during EMT 
and HNSCC progression.
