Respiratory viruses were detected in 33% of patients with CF (8/24) compared with 0% of the healthy controls (0/14) (p = 0.017). Respiratory viruses were only detected during the winter months, and the most commonly identified were influenza A and human rhinovirus strains. There was no statistical difference in the 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores (p = 0.93) or modified Lund-Kennedy scores (p = 0.74) between patients with CF with a positive viral test and those without a positive result.
