OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The role of respiratory viral infection in the
pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been rarely studied and remains 
controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of respiratory
viruses in the chronic status of CRS.
STUDY DESIGN: A case-control prospective study.
METHODS: Fifty-three control subjects, and 67 CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) and
61 CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) patients without signs of acute viral
infection were enrolled. Epithelial cells scraped from the middle nasal meatus
were tested for the nucleic acid of nine common respiratory viruses using
polymerase chain reaction assay. The clinical disease severity was compared
between subjects with and without viral infection.
RESULTS: The overall detection rate of viral infection was 75.47%, 68.66%, and
73.77% in controls, CRSwNP, and CRSsNP, respectively, and no significant
difference among studied groups was observed. There was no significant difference
in detection rate of any specific individual virus or multiple viruses among the 
groups studied either. Visual analog scale scores of symptoms, computed
tomography scores, or endoscope scores did not show obvious difference between
subjects with and without viral infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a high frequency of viral infection could be observed in
the middle nasal meatus, no increase of frequency of viral infection could be
demonstrated in chronic persistent phase of CRSsNP and CRSwNP. The contribution
of the interaction between viral infection and host immunity to the pathogenesis 
of CRS remains to be determined.
