BACKGROUND: The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and overall
survival (OS) in oropharynx cancer (OPC) was retrospectively examined in TAX 324,
a phase III trial of sequential therapy for locally advanced head and neck
cancer.
METHODS: Accrual for TAX 324 was completed in 2003 and data updated through 2008.
Pretherapy tumor biopsies were studied by PCR for human papillomavirus type 16
and linked to OS, progression-free survival (PFS) and demographics.
RESULTS: Of 264 patients with OPC, 111 (42%) had evaluable biopsies; 56 (50%)
were HPV+ and 55 (50%) were HPV-. HPV+ patients were significantly younger (54
versus 58 years, P = 0.02), had T1/T2 primary cancers (49% versus 20%, P =
0.001), and had a performance status of zero (77% versus 49%, P = 0.003). OS and 
PFS were better for HPV+ patients (OS, hazard ratio = 0.20, P < 0.0001).
Local-regional failure was less in HPV+ patients (13% versus 42%, P = 0.0006); at
5 years, 82% of HPV+ patients were alive compared with 35% of HPV- patients
(P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV+ OPC has a different biology compared with HPV- OPC; 5-year OS, 
PFS, and local-regional control are unprecedented. These results support the
possibility of selectively reducing therapy and long-term morbidity in HPV+ OPC
while preserving survival and approaching HPV- disease with more aggressive
treatment.
