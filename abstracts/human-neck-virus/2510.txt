PURPOSE: Our previous study has revealed that EphA2 overexpression is
significantly associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis in patients 
with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). However, the function 
of EphA2 in tumorigenesis and cervical lymph node metastasis of SCCHN has never
been elucidated in vivo.
METHODS: EphA2 was knocked down in SCCHN cell lines. CCK-8 assays,
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, invasion and migration assays were 
performed in vitro. In vivo tumorigenicity assays were performed, and the impact 
on cervical lymph node metastasis was evaluated.
RESULTS: The present investigation demonstrated that suppression of EphA2
resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, migration, invasion of
SCCHN cells in vitro and markedly diminished their tumorigenicity and lymph node 
metastasis in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that EphA2 plays a critical role in SCCHN
growth and metastasis and may be a promising therapeutic target to prevent the
progression of SCCHN.
