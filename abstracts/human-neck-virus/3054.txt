Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is considered a rare variant of lichen planus
(LP). It is characterized by acquired dark brown to gray macular pigmentation
located on sun-exposed areas of the face, neck, and flexures, commonly found in
dark-skinned patients. In patients with LPP, an inflammatory lichenoid response
results in marked pigmentary incontinence. It has been associated with hepatitis 
C virus, sun exposure, and contactants such as mustard oil and nickel.
LPP-inversus affects fair and dark skin, predominantly involving flexural and
intertriginous areas, while sun-exposed areas are spared; friction is an
associated trigger. LPP along Blaschko's lines has been associated with
susceptibility to genetic mosaicisms. LPP can present concomitantly with other
variants of LP such as frontal fibrosing alopecia, as well as endocrinopathies,
and autoimmune diseases. Treatment is difficult and consists of avoidance of
triggers and topical and systemic medications in order to stop the inflammatory
reaction and reduce pigmentation, improving aesthetic appearance and quality of
life.
