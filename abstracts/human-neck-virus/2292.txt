Integration, which leads to the disruption of the circular HPV genome, is
considered as a critical, albeit not obligatory, step in carcinogenic
progression. Although cervical carcinomas with extrachromosomal HPV plasmid
genomes have been described, the virus is integrated in 70% of HPV16-positive
cervical tumours. Limited information is available about HPV integration in head 
and neck tumours (HNC). In this study, we have characterised the physical status 
of HPV in a set of tonsillar tumour samples using different methods--the mapping 
of E2 integration breakpoint at the mRNA level, the 3' RACE based Amplification
of Papillomavirus Oncogene Transcripts (APOT) assay and Southern blot.
Furthermore, the impact of HPV integration on patients' prognosis has been
evaluated in a larger set of 186 patients with head and neck cancer. Based on the
analysis of E2 mRNA, HPV was integrated in the host genome in 43% of the
HPV-positive samples. Extrachromosomal or mixed form was present in 57%. In fresh
frozen samples, the APOT and E2 mapping results were in agreement. The results
were confirmed using Southern blotting. Furthermore, the type and exact site of
integration were determined. The survival analysis of 186 patients revealed HPV
positivity, tumour size and lymph node positivity as factors that influence
disease specific survival. However, no statistically significant difference was
found in disease specific survival between patients with HPV-positive integrated 
vs. extrachromosomal/mixed forms of the virus.
