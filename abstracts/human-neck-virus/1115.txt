OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus-associated (HPV) oropharyngeal cancer is a unique
clinical entity whose incidence is increasing. It is controversial whether
traditional pathologic markers of aggressive head and neck cancer also apply in
surgically treated HPV-associated disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study, systematic review, and meta-analysis Data
Sources: PubMed and Cochrane review.
REVIEW METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane review were searched for published articles
on surgically treated HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Eligible studies were 
included in a meta-analysis of survival using several clinicopathologic markers
as predictors. Surgically treated HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients at
our institution were studied retrospectively and added to the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eight published reports, plus our retrospective series, were included in
the meta-analysis. This showed significant impact on event-free survival for T
stage, nodal number, perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion (all P <
.05) but not for N stage extracapsular extension ( P = ns).
CONCLUSIONS: While many traditional clinico-pathologic markers of aggressive
disease in head and neck cancer also impact survival in surgically treated
HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, extracapsular extension may be less
important.
