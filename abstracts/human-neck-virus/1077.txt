BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of transoral
nasopharyngeal brush biopsies and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection system in surveillance of local recurrence
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed to compare the nasopharyngeal
epithelial EBV DNA levels of patients with recurrent NPC and the control group of
postirradiated patients with NPC disease in remission.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients with recurrent NPC and 15 postirradiated patients in
disease remission were recruited for transoral brush biopsies. There was a
statistically significant difference between the mean EBV detection level (EDL)
of the recurrence group (EDL = 2.38) and the control group (EDL = 0.17;
p < .0001). There was no significant correlation between the EDL and the
recurrence of T classification disease.
CONCLUSION: The transoral brush biopsy and qPCR EBV DNA detection system may
provide an additional surveillance strategy for recurrence of NPC. Further study 
is required to validate its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness. ©
