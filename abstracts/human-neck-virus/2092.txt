PURPOSE: We report a subgroup analysis primarily focused on human papillomavirus 
(HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) from the Cetuximab Plus Radiotherapy
Versus Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
(CTXMAB+RT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01216020) trial comparing radiation 
therapy with concomitant cisplatin (CDDP) versus concomitant cetuximab (CTX) as
first-line treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from all the patients in the CTXMAB+RT trial were
reviewed and separately analyzed in 3 groups: p16-positive OPC, p16-negative OPC,
and all other cancer sites. The endpoints of interest were locoregional control
(LC), metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall
survival (OS). Severe and fatal infectious complications were also reanalyzed to 
more thoroughly investigate the association between CTX treatment and potentially
life-threatening reactions.
RESULTS: A total of 33 patients had OPC. The HPV status was available for 30 of
the 33 patients. Thus, 3 patients treated with CDDP but with unknown HPV status
were excluded from the survival analysis. The small number of patients in each
group did not allow for significance to be reached for any of the outcomes
analyzed. A trend favored the CDDP arm in the p16-positive group for the 2-year
LC and OS/CSS rates (100% vs 72.9% and 100% vs 77.8% for CDDP vs CTX). In this
group of patients, the hazard ratio for the treatment arm (CTX vs CDDP) was 4.7
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-40.3) for LC, 3.4 (95% CI 0.4-30.5) for OS, and
2.4 for CSS (95% CI 0.2-23.2). A survival benefit favoring the CDDP arm was not
evident in the p16-negative OPC group or for patients with cancer located in
other sites. Serious or fatal infectious complications occurred only in the CTX
arm.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with p16-positive OPC in the CTXMAB+RT trial, CTX had
lower efficacy than CDDP, with possible implications for treatment selection in
this clinical setting.
