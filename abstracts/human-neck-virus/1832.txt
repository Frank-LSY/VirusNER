High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HGNECs) of the head and neck have the
morphological appearance of undifferentiated carcinomas and could be
histologically similar to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated non-keratinizing 
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The aim of the study is to
characterize histologically, immunohistochemically, and virologically these
unusual neoplasms. Nineteen HGNECs of the head and neck (1 oropharyngeal, 5
sinonasal, 7 of the larynx, and 6 of the parotid gland) were reviewed and
analyzed with a immunohistochemical panel, with special emphasis on cell cycle
proteins. The tumors were tested for HPV by in situ hybridization (GenPoint HPV, 
Dako) and PCR (SPF10-DEIA-LiPA25). Merkel cell polyomavirus was studied using the
antibody CM2B4. Fifteen HGNEC were of small cell and 4 of large cell type. Most
of the tumors (14/19, 73.7 %), including all the pure small cell carcinomas,
showed a strong and diffuse positive staining for p16. Eleven of them (78.5 %)
had Rb loss and a low or absent cyclin D1 expression. All cases were negative for
HPV and polyomavirus. Most patients were smokers, diagnosed at advanced stages of
the disease, and had a poor outcome, with a 5-year survival of 18 %. In
conclusion, HGNECs of the head and neck are infrequently related to HPV
infection, but usually show strong, diffuse positive p16 immunostaining due to Rb
pathway dysregulation. Awareness of this immunohistochemical pattern of
expression may avoid a potential diagnostic pitfall with HPV-associated
non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, which have a better prognosis.
