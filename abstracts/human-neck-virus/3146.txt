Recent literature points to postviral sensory neuropathy as a possible cause for 
refractory chronic cough. Vagal neuropathy may affect the sensory branches,
inducing chronic cough or laryngospasm. Although the clinical presentation is
fairly well described, there is little in the way of diagnostic criteria to
establish this diagnosis. This article highlights the clinical picture of this
disease and the efficacy, side-effect profiles of the currently used
pharmacological interventions.
