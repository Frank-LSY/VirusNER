Translational research refers to the interfaces between preclinical research and 
targeted short- and medium-term developments through to clinical standards. There
are two distinct groups of oropharyngeal malignancies: those caused by tobacco
and alcohol abuse and those caused by HPV infection. Although the prognosis of
patients in the latter group is significantly better, this is not taken into
consideration in the choice of treatment. However, less intensive use of
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery, as well as targeted multimodal
therapeutic approaches, is under research. This article summarizes the main
events in the HPV life cycle, with emphasis on carcinogenic mechanisms and
potential new molecular targets. Identifying distinct tumor entities of the
oropharynx enables the design and development of new preventive and therapeutic
strategies to reduce the incidence and mortality of HPV-associated oropharyngeal 
cancers in the near future.
