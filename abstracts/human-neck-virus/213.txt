Infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) has been identified as the cause of
recurrent papillomatosis and of a subgroup of squamous cell carcinomas of the
head and neck. A change in prevalence of these lesions, especially for
oropharyngeal carcinoma, can be expected as a consequence of the introduction of 
prophylactic HPV vaccines for young women, targeting the most frequent high- and 
low-risk HPV subtypes. Vaccination for the major low-risk HPV types has proven to
be highly effective against genital warts and activity against papillomatosis can
be expected. The possibilities of prophylactic HPV vaccination as well as new
developments and the rationale for therapeutic vaccines are discussed on the
basis of the current literature.
