OBJECTIVE: Human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative head and neck
squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) are biologically distinct with a prognostic
advantage for HPV positive patients compared to HPV negative cases. DNA promoter 
methylation is central to human diseases such as cancer, including HNSCC, with
reported genome-wide hypomethylaton and promoter hypermethylation in HPV positive
HNSCC tumors. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated
genes in HPV positive versus HPV negative primary HNSCC genomes with clues to
signaling networks.
STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory-based study.
SETTING: Primary care academic health care system.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA from 4 HPV positive and 4 HPV negative freshly frozen
primary HNSCC were subject to comprehensive genome-wide methylation profiling.
Differentially methylated gene lists were examined using the Signal Transduction 
Pathways (canonical) filter in the Genomatix Pathway System (GePS).
RESULTS: Twofold methylation differences were observed between HPV positive and
HPV negative cases for 1168 genes. Pathway analysis applied to investigate the
biological role of the 1168 differentially methylated genes revealed 8 signal
transduction pathways forming a network of 66 genes, of which 62% are
hypermethylated.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a predominant hypermethylation profile for genes in
signal transduction pathways of HPV positive HNSCC tumor genomes. Because
signaling events in the cell play a critical role in the execution of key
biological functions, insights into how complex cellular signaling cascades and
networks may be programmed in HNSCC are likely to be critical in the development 
of new biological agents designed to hit multiple targets.
