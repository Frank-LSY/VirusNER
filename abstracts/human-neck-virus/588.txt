Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) related to human papillomavirus (HPV) represent a growing and distinct patient cohort with unique molecular and epidemiologic characteristics. These patients have markedly improved survival outcomes compared to those with traditional HNC, leading some to advocate for treatment dose reduction. In this article, we review ongoing clinical trials investigating several ways to reduce therapeutic intensity for patients with HPV-positive HNC, discuss the risks and benefits associated with these trials, and summarize the data underlying the advancement of dose reduction trials for patients with HPV-positive HNC.
