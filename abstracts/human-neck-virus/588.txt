BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a cause of oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC), but its pathogenic role in larynx squamous cell carcinoma
(LSCC) remains unclear.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-institutional, retrospective case-series was
performed to estimate the etiological fraction (EF) for HPV in LSCC. Eligible
cases included 436 consecutive cases of LSCC diagnosed (2005-2014) at The Ohio
State University Medical Center. HPV DNA presence was detected by consensus
primer PCR (Inno-LiPa) and HPV type-specific qPCR. HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression was 
detected by type-specific qRT-PCR. Tumor p16 expression was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected by Inno-LiPa in 54 of 404 (13.4%, 95% CI 10.2-17.1)
evaluable samples but was confirmed by HPV type-specific qPCR in only 14 (3.5%,
95% CI 1.9-5.7). Only 7 of 404 (1.7%, 95% CI 0.7-3.5) LSCC were positive for HPV 
E6/E7 mRNA expression, including HPV16 (n=4) and 1 each for 11, 26 and 33. In the
HPV11-positive tumor, Sanger sequencing discovered 6 nucleotide mutations in the 
upstream regulation region, E6 and E7. Of 404 LSCC, 18 had strong and diffuse p16
expression. In comparison to a gold standard of HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression, p16
expression had a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI 29.0-96.3), specificity of 96.7%
(95% CI 94.5-98.3), positive-predictive-value (PPV) of 27.8% (95% CI 9.7-53.5)
and negative-predictive-value of 99.5% (95% CI 98.1-99.9).
CONCLUSION: The EF for HPV in LSCC is low (1.7%) in a geographic region with high
EF for OPSCC. Low-risk HPV may rarely cause LSCC. Finally, p16 expression has
poor PPV for HPV in LSCC.
