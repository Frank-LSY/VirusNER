Detection of human papilloma virus (HPV) in tissue specimens has been a clinical 
challenge since last 2 decades; however, screening for presence of E6/E7
transcripts is regarded as the gold standard, and it verifies the active HPV
infection. Here, we describe "RNAscopeÂ® assay" a novel RNA in situ hybridization 
(ISH) technology; which detects E6/E7 mRNA of seven high risk HPV subtypes (HPV
16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58) in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue
samples.
