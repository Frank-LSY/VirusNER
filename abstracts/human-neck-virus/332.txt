Archival baseline tumor specimens were obtained from patients treated on two clinical trials in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN: E1395, a phase III trial of cisplatin and paclitaxel versus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, and E3301, a phase II trial of irinotecan and docetaxel. HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) with a wide-spectrum probe. p16 status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Clinical outcomes of interest were objective response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
