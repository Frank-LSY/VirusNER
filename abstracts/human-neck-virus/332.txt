MATERIAL AND METHODS: Presence of HPV DNA was analyzed in mouthwash and tonsillar
swab samples, if indicative of HPV-positive tonsillar or base of tongue cancer in
76 patients, with suspected head neck cancer, undergoing diagnostic endoscopy at 
Karolinska University Hospital. The diagnosis and tumor HPV status was later
obtained from patients' records. As controls, 37 tumor-free dental visitors were 
included.
RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, 22/29 (76%) and 16/18 (89%) had an HPV-positive
tonsillar and base of tongue cancer respectively, with 18/22 (82%) and 8/16 (50%)
respectively having tumor concordant HPV-type positive oral samples. Two other
HPV-positive oral samples in the base of tongue cancer group did not correlate to
the tumor HPV status. Among the remaining patients, 19 with other head neck
cancer and 10 with benign conditions, 4/29 (14%) had HPV-positive oral samples.
Consequently, of the HPV-positive oral samples, dominated by HPV16 and high
signals, 27/32 (84%) were derived from 26 patients with concordant HPV-type
positive tonsillar or base of tongue cancer and one patient with an unknown
primary head and neck cancer. The other five HPV-positive oral samples, with
mainly low signals were derived from two patients with non-concordant HPV-type
positive tumor biopsies, two patients with HPV-negative tumor biopsies and a
patient with a benign condition. Of the dental patients, 3/37 (8%) had
HPV-positive tonsillar swabs with weak signals.
CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected head neck cancer, HPV-positive oral
samples, especially HPV16 with high signals, could be indicative of HPV-positive 
tonsillar or base of tongue cancer.
