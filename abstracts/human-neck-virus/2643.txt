RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary conserved mechanism for specific gene 
silencing. There are currently numerous cancer therapy clinical trials based on
RNAi technology. Using an adenoviral system as a delivery mediator of RNAi, we
investigated the therapeutic effects of targeting three genes simultaneously in
vitro and in vivo. In this study, we constructed an recombinant adenoviral shRNA 
expression system as Adv-pEGFP-shVEGF-shTERT-shBcl-xl for multi-genes silencing. 
Our results showed that the adenoviral vector can achieve above 90% of
transfection efficiency and induced obvious apoptosis in CNE-2 cell both in vitro
and in vivo compared with targeting the TERT alone or controlled group.
