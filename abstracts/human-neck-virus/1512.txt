OBJECTIVES: For patients with tobacco-related head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), the occurrence of a second primary tumor (SPT) is an ominous
development that is attributed to a field cancerization effect and portends a
poor clinical outcome. The goal of this study was to determine whether patients
with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related index tonsillar carcinomas can also
develop SPTs in the contralateral tonsil, and to discern the molecular etiology
of HPV-related tumor multifocality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The surgical pathology archives of The Johns Hopkins
Hospital were searched for all patients with primary HPV-related tonsillar
squamous cell carcinoma who developed a synchronous or metachronous carcinoma in 
the contralateral tonsil. The HPV-16 E6 exon was sequenced from each independent 
cancer site to determine whether the tumor pairs harbored the same or a different
HPV-16 variant.
RESULTS: Four patients with bilateral HPV-related tonsillar carcinomas were
identified. In every case, the HPV DNA sequences derived from the index tumor and
corresponding SPT were 100% concordant, indicating that the index and SPTs were
caused by the same HPV-16 variant.
CONCLUSION: For the small subset of patients with tonsillar carcinomas who
develop SPTs in the contralateral tonsil, the index case and the SPT consistently
harbored the same HPV variant. This finding suggests that HPV-related tumor
multi-focality can be attributed either to independent inoculation events by the 
same virus, or by migration of HPV-infected cells from a single inoculation site 
to other regions of Waldeyer's ring.
