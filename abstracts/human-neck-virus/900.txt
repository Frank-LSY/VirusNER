INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRs) are short (~20 nucleotides) non-coding
ribonuecleic acids (ncRNAs) known to be involved in cellular processes such as
proliferation, differentiation, immune response, pathogenicity and
tumourigenesis, among many others. The regulatory mechanisms exerted by miRs have
been implicated in many cancers, including Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated 
cancers. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the involvement of
miRs (-143, -375, -21, -200, -296 etc.) that have been shown to be dysregulated
in HPV-associated cancers. This review also encompasses both intracellular and
exosomal miRs, and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers in saliva and blood. 
The authors have also attempted to dissect the functional impact of miRs on
cellular processes such as changes in cellular polarity, loss of apoptosis and
tumour suppression, and unchecked and uncontrolled cell cycle regulation, all of 
which ultimately lead to aberrant cellular proliferation. Expert commentary:
Identification of dysregulated miRs in HPV-associated cancers opens up new
opportunities to develop diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers.
Studies on global expression patterns of miRs dysregulated in HPV-associated
cancers can be instrumental in developing broader therapeutic strategies.
Therapies like anti-miR, miR-replacement and those based on alternative natural
products targeting miRs, need to be improved and better synchronized to be
cost-effective and have better treatment outcomes.
