Registries at the Universities of Hamburg and Kiel were searched for patients with CUP diagnosed from 2002 to 2011 who had formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded metastatic lymph node samples available. All patients underwent routine diagnostic procedures to establish the primary site and received radiotherapy (60Gy using conventional fractionation) with or without concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy depending on disease extent. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction; p16([INK4a]) expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry.
