OBJECTIVES: Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is associated with a decrease in bone mineral 
density (BMD). Treatment with efavirenz is associated with vitamin D deficiency. 
We compared the effects of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) with the effects of raltegravir, darunavir, and ritonavir 
(RAL/DRV/r) on BMD and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in HIV-infected,
antiretroviral treatment-naïve African American subjects.
METHODS: This was a pilot study at a single HIV clinic. Forty HIV treatment-naïve
African American subjects were screened, 35 of whom were randomized to receive
either EFV/FTC/TDF or RAL/DRV/r. All of the subjects received supplemental
vitamin D3 and calcium. CD4 counts, HIV RNA, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin,
N-telopeptide, and 25(OH)D levels were obtained at baseline and at 8, 24, 36, and
48 weeks. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the spine and hip was performed at 
baseline and at week 48.
RESULTS: Of the 35 subjects enrolled, 10 patients receiving each regimen
completed the study. Median baseline 25(OH)D levels were decreased and similar in
both groups. All of the patients had plasma HIV RNA <50 copies per milliliter by 
week 24. By week 48, there was a sustained increase in 25(OH)D in the RAL/DRV/r
group (P = 0.0004) but not in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (P = 0.78). There were
reductions in BMD of the mean total hip (P = 0.002) and the mean femoral neck (P 
= 0.004) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group but not in the RAL/DRV/r group.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of African American patients with HIV using EFV/FTC/TDF is
associated with a reduction in BMD of the hip and sustained reductions of 25(OH)D
not seen in the group that received RAL/DRV/r. This phenomenon may have long-term
consequences on bone integrity in this population.
