BACKGROUND: Little is known about the association between oral and anogenital
human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.
METHODS: Oral and anal samples from 66 men who have sex with men with a history
of HPV-related anogenital squamous intraepithelial lesions were analyzed using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and typed for 38 HPV types.
RESULTS: Prevalence of oral HPV infection was 30%, versus 82% for anal infection.
Prevalence of oral and anal high-risk HPV infection was 11% and 64%,
respectively. Concurrent oral-anal any-type HPV infection was found in 26% of
participants, whereas concordant type-specific HPV prevalence was 5%. In
multivariate analysis, number of partners from whom the participant received
oral-penile sex and number of partners on whom the participant performed
oral-penile sex were associated with oral HPV infection.
CONCLUSION: Oral HPV prevalence in this cohort is high, however, concordant
type-specific oral-anal HPV infection was rare. Increased risk of oral HPV
infection was associated with oral-penile sex. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
