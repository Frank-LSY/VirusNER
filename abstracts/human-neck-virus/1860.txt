BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as a causative agent and
positive prognostic factor for oropharyngeal (OP) head and neck squamous cell
cancer (HNSCC). This prompts inquiry into whether therapy improvements or
increasing incidence of HPV drives the apparent improvements in HNSCC outcomes
observed in non-randomized clinical trials.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all locoregionally advanced HNSCC patients
treated with chemotherapy and radiation in prospective institutional trials at a 
single institution. Patients were divided into three groups (1, 2, 3) according
to treatment time period (1993-1998, 1999-2003, 2004-2010, respectively). We
reasoned that if a favorable trend was observed over time in OP but not non-OP
patients, HPV status may be confounding treatment effects, whereas this would be 
unlikely if both subgroups improved over time.
RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-two patients were identified with OP (55.7%) and
non-OP (44.3%) HNSCC. Five-year OP overall survival (OS) improved from 42.3%
(group 1) to 72.5% (group 2), and 78.4% (group 3), adjusted P = 0.0084. Non-OP
5-year OS was 51.0% (group 1), 58.8% (group 2), and 66.3% (group 3), adjusted P =
0.51. Five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) improved for OP groups from 42.3% 
to 68.4% to 75.8% (adjusted P = 0.017). Non-OP 5-year RFS was 42.9%, 53.6%, and
61.7% for sequential groups (adjusted P = 0.30). Five-year OP distant
failure-free survival (DFFS) improved from 42.3% to 71.1% to 77.8% (adjusted P = 
0.011). Five-year non-OP DFFS was 46.9%, 57.1%, and 66.0% for sequential groups
(adjusted P = 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past two decades, OP HNSCC outcomes improved significantly,
while non-OP outcomes only trended toward improvement. Although our patients are 
not stratified by HPV status, improving OP outcomes are likely at least partly
due to the increasing HPV incidence. These data further justify trial
stratification by HPV status, investigations of novel approaches for
carcinogen-related HNSCC, and current de-intensification for HPV-related HNSCC.
