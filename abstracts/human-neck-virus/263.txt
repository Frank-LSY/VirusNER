Overall, our review points to smoking tobacco posing an additional risk for development of head and neck cancer in the presence of HPV infection. This is consistent with available laboratory data that show evidence of biological plausibility for interaction between smoking and progression of HPV infection to carcinogenesis. It is therefore important that cessation of smoking is promoted in smokers with HPV infection.
