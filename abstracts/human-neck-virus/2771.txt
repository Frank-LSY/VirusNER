PURPOSE: The incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has increased over the past 
decades in the United States. We aimed at examining the global impact of
HPV-associated HNSCC and whether the established key role of mTOR activation in
HNSCC is also observed in HPV(+) HNSCC lesions, thereby providing novel treatment
options for HPV-associated HNSCC patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An international HNSCC tissue microarray (TMA) was used to
analyze the expression of p16(INK4A), a surrogate for HPV infection, and Akt-mTOR
pathway activation. Results were confirmed in a large collection of HPV(-) and
HPV(+) HNSCC cases and in a cervical cancer (CCSCC) TMA. Observations were
validated in HNSCC and CCSCC-derived cell lines, which were xenografted into
immunodeficient mice for tumorigenesis assays.
RESULTS: Approximately 20% of all HNSCC lesions could be classified as HPV(+),
irrespective of their country of origin. mTOR pathway activation was observed in 
most HPV(+) HNSCC and CCSCC lesions and cell lines. The preclinical efficacy of
mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and RAD001 was explored in HPV(+) HNSCC and CCSCC
tumor xenografts. Both mTOR inhibitors effectively decreased mTOR activity in
vivo and caused a remarkable decrease in tumor burden. These results emphasize
the emerging global impact of HPV-related HNSCCs and indicate that the activation
of the mTOR pathway is a widespread event in both HPV(-) and HPV-associated HNSCC
and CCSCC lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: The emerging results may provide a rationale for the clinical
evaluation of mTOR inhibitors as a molecular targeted approach for the treatment 
of HPV-associated malignancies.
