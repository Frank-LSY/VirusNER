Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a rare variant of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Wain's criteria (peripheral palisading,
association with SCC, high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, high mitotic rate, solid
growth), anti-34BE12 and CK 5/6 staining, and absence of neuroendocrine markers
are mandatory for the diagnosis of BSCC. Its increasing incidence parallels that 
of human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive tumours for the oropharyngeal subsite. On
the other hand, BSCC is frequently considered a high-grade carcinoma of poorer
prognosis than its SCC counterparts, mostly due to a higher rate of distant
metastases. However, BSCC has similar or better locoregional control rates and a 
relatively better radiosensitivity than SCC. BSCC seems to have a dual behaviour 
depending, at least partly, on its recently described association with HPV. The
basaloid subtype of SCC, owing to its particular behaviour, should be
systematically investigated along with HPV and smoking status, as those factors
may be determinant in the response to treatment.
