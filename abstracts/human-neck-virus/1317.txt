BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the validity of
Cervista human papillomavirus (HPV) assays in head and neck fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) specimens from patients with head and neck squamous carcinomas
and to verify that the Cervista assay in FNA specimens is a valid option for
determining HPV status in patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively retrieved 64 head and neck FNA specimens
from patients who had head and neck squamous carcinoma. The specimens were tested
for HPV types 16 and 18 (HPV16/18) and for high-risk (HR) HPV DNA using the
Cervista HPV16/18 and HPV HR assays, respectively. The results from those assays 
were compared with the results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HPV
assays in the same tissues and with the results from HPV in situ hybridization
assays/p16 immunostaining in the corresponding primary tumors.
RESULTS: In total, 64 FNA specimens were analyzed. The Cervista HPV16/18 and/or
HPV HR assays were positive in 48 of 64 specimens (75%), and there was a
predominance of HPV16 (42 of 48 specimens; 88%). In the 49 specimens that had
PCR-based test results, overall agreement with Cervista assay results was 96% (47
of 49 specimens; κ = 0.883). In the 49 specimens that had PCR-based HPV16/18
genotyping results, overall agreement with the Cervista HPV16/18 results was 94% 
(46 of 49 specimens; κ = 0.847). In the 36 primary carcinoma specimens that had
valid HPV in situ hybridization/p16 immunostaining results, overall agreement
with the Cervista assay results was 92% (33 of 36 specimens; κ = 0.679).
CONCLUSIONS: Cervista HPV16/18 and Cervista HPV HR testing of head and neck FNA
specimens is a valid option for determining HPV16/18 status in patients with
oropharyngeal carcinoma.
