OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the prevalence of
transcriptionally active human papilloma virus (HPV) in tissue samples of Indian 
patients with leukoplakia, predominantly hyperplastic lesions and head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In addition, saliva samples from patients with
HNSCC were screened for HPV detection.
STUDY DESIGN: P16 overexpression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Tissue
samples of leukoplakia (n = 121) and HNSCC (n = 427) and saliva from patients
with HNSCC (n = 215) were tested for HPV using nested polymerase chain reaction. 
Positive samples were sequenced for subtyping. The presence of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was
confirmed by RNA in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: P16 expression and HPV DNA were not detected in any of the leukoplakia
specimens. Of the 427 HNSCC tumors, 9 showed p16 overexpression and 7/427 cases
were positive for HPV16 DNA, in saliva or tissue. E6/E7 mRNA positivity was
observed in 8 HNSCC samples, primarily from patients with no habit of tobacco
consumption. The prevalence of high-risk HPV was restricted to oropharynx and
larynx, with very little concordance between p16 overexpression and HPV
positivity. All patients with HPV-positive saliva samples had transcriptionally
active HPV present in their tumors.
CONCLUSION: The presence of HPV DNA does not necessarily reflect
transcriptionally active virus in tumors; hence, it is important to consider this
fact while categorizing HPV-associated tumors.
