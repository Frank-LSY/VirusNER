OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established as an
etiologic and prognostic factor in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
HPV oncogenesis involves expression of E6/E7 oncoproteins, with downstream p53
degradation and pRb inhibition. Although much research has focused on HPV's
oncogenic behavior in primary OPSCC, minimal information exists about HPV in
adjacent normal and metastatic tissue.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study
METHODS: Patient-matched tumor, normal, and metastatic tissue was gathered from
42 OPSCC patients and tested with real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization (ISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
RT-qPCR was performed using total RNA from fresh-frozen tissues and primers for
HPV16 E6, E7, and p16 transcripts. HPV ISH was performed to detect the presence
of HPV DNA and IHC to detect p16 protein.
RESULTS: Primary tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and tumor metastasis from 17
OPSCC patients were analyzed. When comparing the presence of HPV16 DNA in tumor, 
metastatic, and normal tissue by ISH, perfect correlation is found at all
subsites (P < .0001). However, active infections determined by HPV16 E6 and E7
expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or p16 detection by IHC, 
were present only in primary and metastatic tissue (P = .0012, E6; P = .02, E7). 
No such correlation was found in normal tissue when compared to primary or
metastatic tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear pattern of active HPV expression that correlates to
disease course. In HPV-positive patients, all sites including primary,
metastatic, and normal tissues are DNA positive. Transcriptionally active
infections were detected in primary and metastatic tissues, whereas normal
tissues appear to have latent infections.
