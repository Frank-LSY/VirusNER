Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as a risk factor for oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), especially tonsillar and base of tongue cancer.
Furthermore, HPV-positive tonsillar and base of tongue SCC have a significantly
better prognosis than their HPV-negative counterparts and head and neck cancer
(HNSCC) in general. HPV has recently also been implicated in cancer of unknown
primary (CUP) in the head and neck region, where a primary tumour is not found
despite extensive workup. Using fine-needle aspiration cytology to determine CUP 
HPV status in cervical lymph nodes could be of advantage, since it is minimally
invasive and it is assumed that an HPV-positive lymph node metastasis likely has 
an HPV-positive otopharyngeal SCC origin. We review the current knowledge of HPV 
in HNSCC, with an emphasis on CUP of the head and neck region, its relation to
oropharyngeal, tonsillar and base of tongue SCC and implications of HPV status
for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.
