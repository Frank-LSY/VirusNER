OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to explore the inhibitive role of
cyclin D1 gene silence in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by
lentivirus-mediated RNA interference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus and the control lentivirus
(GFP-Lentivirus) were transfected into Hep-2 cells. Reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction was performed to explore the cyclin D1 expression level
in Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus-transfected Hep 2 cells. The apoptosis and viability of
Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus-treated Hep-2 cells were measured with flow cytometry and
methyl thiazolyl tetrazoliym assay. In an animal experiment, 10 mice bearing
Hep-2 cell tumor were intratumorally injected with Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus; and the
other 10 mice were injected with GFP-Lentivirus. Terminal
deoxytransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stains and transmission electron
microscope were used to observe the apoptosis in the xenografts.
RESULTS: Cyclin D1 was knocked down after Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus was transfected
into Hep-2 cells. The proliferative ability of Hep-2 cells was significantly
inhibited by Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus, and a significant apoptosis of Hep-2 cells was 
also observed after Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus transfection. The average weight and
volume of tumors in the Cd1-RNAi-Lentivirus-treated group were significantly
lower than those in the control group (P < .01). The significant apoptosis was
detected with terminal deoxytransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stain and
transmission electron microscope.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that cyclin D1 gene silence by
lentivirus-mediated RNA interference can inhibit growth and promote apoptosis of 
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
