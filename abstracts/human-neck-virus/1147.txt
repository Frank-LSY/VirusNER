The involvement of lower cranial nerve palsies is less frequent in Ramsay Hunt
syndrome caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). The authors report 1 of
extremely rare patients of radiologically proven polyneuropathy of VZV infection 
with magnetic resonance imaging findings of VII, IX, and X cranial nerve
involvement is a 62-year-old female patient, who initially presented with Ramsay 
Hunt syndrome. Varicella zoster virus infection should be considered even in
patients who show unilateral palsy of the lower cranial nerves associated with
laryngeal paralysis. Thin-section T2W and T1W images with a contrast agent should
be added to the imaging protocol to show the subtle involvement.
