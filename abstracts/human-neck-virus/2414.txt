Viruses manipulate cell biology to utilize monocytes/macrophages as vessels for
dissemination, long-term persistence within tissues and virus replication.
Viruses enter cells through endocytosis, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis or
membrane fusion. These processes play important roles in the mechanisms
contributing to the pathogenesis of these agents and in establishing viral genome
persistence and latency. Upon viral infection, monocytes respond with an elevated
expression of proinflammatory signalling molecules and antiviral responses, as is
shown in the case of the influenza, Chikungunya, human herpes and Zika viruses.
Human immunodeficiency virus initiates acute inflammation on site during the
early stages of infection but there is a shift of M1 to M2 at the later stages of
infection. Cytomegalovirus creates a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory
processes by inducing a specific phenotype within the M1/M2 continuum. Despite
facilitating inflammation, infected macrophages generally display abolished
apoptosis and restricted cytopathic effect, which sustains the virus production. 
The majority of viruses discussed in this review employ monocytes/macrophages as 
a repository but certain viruses use these cells for productive replication. This
review focuses on viral adaptations to enter monocytes/macrophages, immune
escape, reprogramming of infected cells and the response of the host cells.
