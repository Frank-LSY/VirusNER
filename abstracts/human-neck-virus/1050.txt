OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the baseline awareness of human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection as a cause of head and neck cancer (HNC) to design improved
targeted screening and education efforts.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of collected survey at a cancer screening
event.
METHODS: This was a screening event at three hospitals and one community center
in Miami, Florida. Participants were recruited throughout the Greater Miami area.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic characteristics of 
those who were aware of HPV and those who were not. Adjusted odds ratios, odds
ratios, and χ2 tests were used in statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 196 women and 112 men were screened across four sites, with
187 participants at hospital-based events and 124 participants at the
community-based event. Forty percent of respondents had heard of HPV, and 28.0%
identified HPV as a risk factor for HNC. Non-Hispanic and Hispanic respondents
were 3.309 and 2.445 times, respectively, more likely than Haitian respondents to
have heard of HPV. Women were 2.488 times more likely than men to be aware of
HPV. College graduates were 2.268 times more likely than those with less than a
college degree to be aware of HPV. Younger respondents were more likely to be
aware of HPV. Of those who identified HPV as a risk factor for HNC, 95.4% also
correctly identified smoking and 75.9% also correctly identified alcohol as risk 
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in HPV and HNC awareness were noted between gender, age,
education level, and ethnicity.
