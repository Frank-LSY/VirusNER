Curative treatment for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of
the head and neck (SCCHN) is complex and multidisciplinary. Our understanding of 
the optimal management of this disease has improved over the years, incorporating
refined surgical approaches, better radiotherapy delivery methods, and greater
use of systemic therapies. Investigation into shifting epidemiology patterns has 
uncovered two biologically and clinically distinct diseases: the smoking-related 
entity and the increasingly common malignancy associated with human papilloma
virus (HPV). Prognosis favors the latter, driving newer investigations into dose 
de-intensification to limit toxicities in patients with HPV-driven disease, and
alternatively intensifying treatment to improve tumor control in those with a
significant smoking history. In this review, I describe the most recent progress 
in the multi-modal integration of radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, and the
role of targeted agents and personalized therapy, and conclude with a discussion 
of the relevance of these innovations with respect to HPV tumor status.
