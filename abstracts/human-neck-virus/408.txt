Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) suffer disproportionate psychosocial
distress because of the nature of the tumor site, the possible impact on facial
appearance and function, and the symptom burden resulting from treatment. Unmet
psychosocial needs can negatively impact many aspects of care, from compliance to
successful survivorship. This article reviews the challenges that patients with
HNC confront throughout the disease trajectory from diagnosis to treatment,
recovery, and long-term survivorship. It also provides a framework for
understanding psychosocial adjustment and quality of life both for the general
population of patients with HNC, and those with human papillomavirus-related
diagnoses.
