PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of HPV16 load (VL-the number of virus genome
copies per cell) and P16 expression on prognosis of patients with squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCs) of head and neck (HN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPV16 presence was assessed in the group of 109 patients
with HNSCCs by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). VL (assessed by
qPCR) and P16 expression (evaluated by immunohistochemistry) were analysed only
in the subgroup of HPV16-positive tumours. These features were correlated with
5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: HPV16 infection was found in 36 tumours (33.0%). Virus-positive patients
had better OS and DFS than those without infection (P = 0.041 and 0.005). Among
HPV16-positive HNSCCs, 18 (50.0%) had higher VL (median value > 6764.3
copies/cell) and 25 (73.5%) P16 over expression. The significant differences in
OS and DFS (P = 0.008 and 0.004) were noticed according to VL, wherein 100% DFS
was found for patients with higher VL. According to P16 expression, significant
difference was found only for OS (P = 0.020). In multivariate analysis, VL
(P = 0.045; HR = 2.795; CI 0.121-1.060) and the level of smoking (P = 0.023,
HR = 2.253; CI 1.124-4.514) were independent factors affecting DFS of
HPV16-positive patients.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of viral load, it is possible to differentiate prognosis
of patients with HPV16-positive HNSCCs. In this subgroup, viral load has stronger
prognostic potential than P16 expression.
