DNA was isolated from 84 SGTs (80 parotid tumors and 4 submandibular gland tumors) and 28 normal salivary tissue samples from 85 patients in Northeast Italy. Using a highly sensitive type-specific multiplex genotyping assay, we analyzed the samples for the presence of DNA from 62 different viruses including 47 papillomaviruses, 10 polyomaviruses, and 5 herpesviruses.
