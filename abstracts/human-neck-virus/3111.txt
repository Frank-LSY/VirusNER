OBJECTIVE: To date, recovery of olfactory function after viral infection of the
upper airway cannot be achieved reliably with pharmacotherapy. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) on
olfactory function in patients with persistent post-viral olfactory dysfunction
(PVOD).
STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
SETTING: University Medical Center, Department of Otorhinolaryngology.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients presenting to the outpatient clinic 
with PVOD were treated by TCA in 10 weekly, 30-minute sessions. Subjective
olfactometry was performed with the Sniffin' Sticks test set. Treatment success
was defined as an increase in Sniffin' Sticks test scores of at least six points.
The effects of TCA, obtained with the chi(2) test, were compared with those of
matched pairs suffering from PVOD who had been treated with vitamin B complex
over 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Eight patients treated with TCA had improved olfactory function compared
with two treated with vitamin B complex. chi(2) test revealed a significantly
better outcome in olfactory function in patients undergoing acupuncture compared 
with patients receiving vitamin B complex (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: TCA possibly offers a new therapeutic regimen for post-viral
dysosmia. More research in a larger case series is needed before a clearer
picture will emerge.
