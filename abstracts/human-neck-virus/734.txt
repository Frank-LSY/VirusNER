The profound influence of Human papillomavirus (HPV) on the epidemiological
pattern and clinical course of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) has led to a change
in the traditional understanding of this disease entity. Separate therapeutic
strategies based on tumour HPV status are under consideration and in this light
provision of knowledge concerning the influence of tumour HPV on the radiation
response in HNSCC appears highly relevant. This review provides a summary of the 
current understanding of the role of HPV in head and neck cancer with specific
focus on the viral impact on radiotherapy outcome of HNSCC.
