INTRODUCTION: Molecular studies about carcinomas of the oral cavity and
oropharynx demonstrate the presence of human papilomavirus genome in these
tumors, reinforcing the participation of human papilomavirus in oral
carcinogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of human papilomavirus
and genotype distribution of HPV16 and HPV18 in oral cavity and oropharynx
carcinomas, as well as their association with clinical characteristics of the
tumors.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study, with clinical data collected from 82
patients. Human papilomavirus detection was conducted on specimens of oral cavity
and oropharynx carcinomas included in paraffin blocks. Patients were assisted in 
a cancer reference center, in the central region of Brazil, between 2005 and
2007. Polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection and genotyping of
human papilomavirus.
RESULTS: Among the patients evaluated, 78% were male. The average age of the
group was about 58 years. Risk factors, such as smoking (78%) and alcohol
consumption (70.8%) were recorded for the group. HPV DNA was detected in 21 cases
(25.6%; 95% confidence interval 16.9-36.6) of which 33.3% were HPV16 and 14.3%
were HPV18. The presence of lymph node metastases and registered deaths were less
frequent in human papilomavirus positive tumors, suggesting a better prognosis
for these cases; however, the differences between the groups were not
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present study, with respect to the
presence of the high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes, highlight the importance of 
human papilomavirus vaccination in the control of oral cavity and oropharynx
carcinomas.
