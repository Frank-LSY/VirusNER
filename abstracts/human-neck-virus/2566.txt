A number of viral infections can cause hearing loss. Hearing loss induced by
these viruses can be congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral. Certain
viral infections can directly damage inner ear structures, others can induce
inflammatory responses which then cause this damage, and still others can
increase susceptibility or bacterial or fungal infection, leading to hearing
loss. Typically, virus-induced hearing loss is sensorineural, although conductive
and mixed hearing losses can be seen following infection with certain viruses.
Occasionally, recovery of hearing after these infections can occur spontaneously.
Most importantly, some of these viral infections can be prevented or treated. For
many of these viruses, guidelines for their treatment or prevention have recently
been revised. In this review, we outline many of the viruses that cause hearing
loss, their epidemiology, course, prevention, and treatment.
