BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) seem to be related to distant metastasis
(DM) in advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether high-risk HPV viral load may 
predict DM among OSCC patients and stratify patients for risk-adapted treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Viral loads of E7 oncogenes for HPV 16/18 were measured by
quantitative PCR tests in paraffin-embedded lesional specimens from 312 OSCC of
which the HPV genotypes had been determined previously. Multivariable Cox
regression analysis was used to identify the independent prognostic factors for
5-year DM and C statistics were further computed.
RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, high HPV 16 E7 viral load (≥15.0
copies/genome); high HPV 18 E7 viral load (≥15.0 copies/genome); pathological N2 
status (pN2); tumor depth ≥11 mm; extracapsular spread (ECS); and level IV/V
metastases were independent risk factors for DM. We further identified three
prognostic groups. In the high-risk group (level IV/V metastases or high HPV
16/18 E7 viral load plus pN2, tumor depth ≥11 mm, or ECS), the 5-year distant
metastasis rate was 74%. In the intermediate-risk group (high HPV 16/18 E7 viral 
load, pN2, tumor depth ≥11 mm, or ECS), the 5-year DM rate was 17%. Finally, the 
5-year DM rate was 1% in the low-risk group (no risk factors). The value of the C
statistics was 0.78.
CONCLUSIONS: Among OSCC patients, high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load identifies a small
subgroup of patients at high-risk of 5-year DM and suggest the need for more
intensive treatments and follow-up strategies.
