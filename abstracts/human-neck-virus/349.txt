HSV-1 induced illness affects greater than 85% of adults worldwide with no
permanent curative therapy. We used RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to
specifically target for deletion of DNA sequences of the HSV-1 genome that span
the region directing expression of ICP0, a key viral protein that stimulates
HSV-1 gene expression and replication. We found that CRISPR/Cas9 introduced InDel
mutations into exon 2 of the ICP0 gene profoundly reduced HSV-1 infectivity in
permissive human cell culture models and protected permissive cells against HSV-1
infection. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting ICP0 prevented HSV-1-induced
disintegration of promonocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, an intracellular
event critical to productive HSV-1 infection that is initiated by interaction of 
the ICP0 N-terminus with PML. Combined treatment of cells with CRISPR targeting
ICP0 plus the immediate early viral proteins, ICP4 or ICP27, completely abrogated
HSV-1 infection. We conclude that RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop a
novel, specific and efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic platform for
targeted viral genomic ablation to treat HSV-1 diseases.
