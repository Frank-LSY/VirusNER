PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is currently strong evidence supporting human papilloma 
virus (HPV) causation in a distinct disease entity of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC),
with an increasing incidence worldwide.This review aims to critically analyse
whether a change in our management approaches to HPV-positive OPC is now required
for this increasingly significant public health concern.
RECENT FINDINGS: HPV-positive OPC appears to have increased worldwide. HPV status
has a strong prognostic effect, and, in combination with smoking status, primary,
and nodal stage, is useful in the risk stratification of OPC. HPV-positive OPC
responds better to chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and postoperative
chemoradiotherapy than HPV-negative tumours, with improved survival outcomes.
There remain concerns regarding the efficacy of HPV detection assays in clinical 
practice. HPV-negative head and neck cancer still accounts for the largest subset
of patients that we treat and carries poor survival outcomes.
SUMMARY: It is currently not advisable to change management for either
HPV-positive or HPV-negative OPC as there is a lack of high-quality evidence to
support this. High-quality randomized controlled trials are required to assess
the efficacy of the different treatment modalities currently available for both
HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPC.
