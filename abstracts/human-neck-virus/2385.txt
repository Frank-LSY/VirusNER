Eosinophilic folliculitis (EF) is an idiopathic dermatitis included in the
spectrum of eosinophilic pustular follicular reactions. Demodex folliculorum has 
been implicated as contributing to the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency
virus-associated EF, but it has not been described outside this context. We
present an immunocompetent 65-year-old white man with a 5-year history of
recurrent pruritic erythematous and oedematous lesions on his face, neck and
scalp. Histopathologically, an eosinophilic microabcess with Demodex folliculorum
mite within a pilosebaceous follicle was seen, and considered the causal agent.
There were also accumulations of eosinophil granules on collagen bundles, and
flame figure formations in the dermis. We believe that 'eosinophilic follicular
reaction' is an appropriate term to describe this case of EF induced by D.
folliculorum and thus distinguish it from the idiopathic form of EF. Moreover,
this case suggests that D. folliculorum can sometimes induce an eosinophilic
immune reaction.
