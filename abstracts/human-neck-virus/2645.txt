BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) represent a
heterogeneous group of cancers for which human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is
an emerging risk factor. Previous studies showed promoter hypermethylation in
HPV(+) oropharyngeal cancers, but only few consistent target genes have been so
far described, and the evidence of a functional impact on gene expression is
still limited.
METHODS: We performed global and stratified pooled analyses of epigenome-wide
data in HNSCCs based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 bead-array data in order
to identify tissue-specific components and common viral epigenetic targets in
HPV-associated tumours.
RESULTS: We identified novel differentially methylated CpGs and regions
associated with viral infection that are independent of the anatomic site. In
particular, most hypomethylated regions were characterized by a marked loss of
CpG island boundaries, which showed significant correlations with expression of
neighbouring genes. Moreover, a subset of only five CpGs in a few hypomethylated 
regions predicted HPV status with a high level of specificity in different
cohorts. Finally, this signature was a better predictor of survival compared with
HPV status determined by viral gene expression by RNA sequencing in The Cancer
Genome Atlas cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel epigenetic signature of HPV infection in
HNSCCs which is independent of the anatomic site, is functionally correlated with
gene expression and may be leveraged for improved stratification of prognosis in 
HNSCCs.
