Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the 
oropharynx (SCCOP) enjoy better treatment outcomes than patients suffering from
HPV-negative head and neck cancer. To maintain the integrity and utility of
future clinical trials, HPV-positive SCCOP must be studied as a distinct entity. 
The discovery of HPV-positive disease has (1) convoluted comparison of current
phase II trial data to historical controls, (2) made formal stratification for
HPV infection status an imperative for future phase III trial design, and (3)
drawn focus toward opportunities for personalization of treatment intensity. This
review discusses these research issues.
