INTRODUCTION: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of death throughout
the developed world. It is associated with smoking and alcohol consumption. Human
papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 has also been suggested to play a role in etiology
of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). p16 expression is now being
used as a surrogate marker of HPV infection in squamous cell carcinoma and
provides important prognostic information and future therapy planning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, total of 75 cases of HNSCC were
taken. Tumor grade was determined according to World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria. p16 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. The
obtained results were analyzed and evaluated using Chi-square test (Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20), value of P <0.05 was taken
significant.
RESULTS: Out of 75 cases, 78.7% cases were positive for p16 (inclusive of all
grades), while 21.3% cases were negative. Expression of p16 was higher in
nonsmokers and nonalcohol consumers and significantly associated with paan
chewing habit. No significant correlation was seen with history of abnormal
sexual habits, but p16 expression was significantly correlated in cases with
multiple sexual partners (P = 0.003), with increasing histological grade (P =
0.045) and in cases with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: As HPV integration with transcription of viral oncoprotein induces
overexpression of p16, immunohistochemical expression of p16 can be used as a
surrogate marker of HPV. This approach can be implemented in diagnostic
laboratories and can provide support for vaccination program in high risk group.
