OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently recognized
disease entity characterized by high-serum IgG4 concentration and IgG4-producing 
plasma cell production with fibrotic or sclerotic changes in affected organs. We 
aimed to clarify the roles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in patients with IgG4-RDs.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective clinical study at the Yamagata
University School of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan.
METHODS: The patient group consisted of four males and four females with an
average age of 62 years (range: 48-73). Expression of IgG4, latent member protein
1, EBV nuclear antigens-2, and EBV-encoded RNA in affected salivary glands from
patients with IgG4-RD was examined by using immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization. The copy number of EBV DNA in the salivary glands was also
investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: All patients had hard masses in the salivary or lacrimal glands, or
both, bilaterally. Serum concentrations of IgG4 were elevated in all cases (mean 
589.1, range 129-1750), and IgG4-positive plasmacytes were observed in the
involved salivary glands. Four patients developed potentially life-threatening
systemic involvement after initial salivary gland swelling. EBV-associated
molecules (EBNA and EBER) were overexpressed in the affected salivary glands. The
copy number of EBV DNA was significantly higher in patients with potentially
life-threatening systemic involvement than in patients without systemic
involvement (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the copy number of EBV DNA could be useful
as diagnostic findings in IgG4-RD to predict potentially life-threatening
systemic involvement.
