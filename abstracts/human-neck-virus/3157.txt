BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to link expression patterns of
B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) and p16 
to patient outcome (recurrence and survival) in a cohort of 252 patients with
oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OSCC).
METHODS: Expression levels of Bmi-1 and p16 in samples from 252 patients with
OSCC were evaluated immunohistochemically using the tissue microarray method.
Staining intensity was determined by calculating an intensity reactivity score
(IRS). Staining intensity and the localization of expression within tumor cells
(nuclear or cytoplasmic) were correlated with overall, disease-specific, and
recurrence-free survival.
RESULTS: The majority of cancers were localized in the oropharynx (61.1%). In
univariate analysis, patients who had OSCC and strong Bmi-1 expression (IRS >10) 
had worse outcomes compared with patients who had low and moderate Bmi-1
expression (P = .008; hazard ratio [HR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.167-2.838); this correlation was also observed for atypical cytoplasmic Bmi-1
expression (P = .001; HR, 2.164; 95% CI, 1.389-3.371) and for negative p16
expression (P < .001; HR, 0.292; 95% CI, 0.178-0.477). The combination of both
markers, as anticipated, had an even stronger correlation with overall survival
(P < .001; HR, 8.485; 95% CI, 4.237-16.994). Multivariate analysis demonstrated
significant results for patients with oropharyngeal cancers, but not for patients
with oral cavity tumors: Tumor classification (P = .011; HR, 1.838; 95%CI,
1.146-2.947) and the combined marker expression patterns (P < .001; HR, 6.254;
95% CI, 2.869-13.635) were correlated with overall survival, disease-specific
survival (tumor classification: P = .002; HR, 2.807; 95% CI, 1.477-5.334;
combined markers: P = .002; HR, 5.386; 95% CI, 1.850-15.679), and the combined
markers also were correlated with recurrence-free survival (P = .001; HR, 8.943; 
95% CI, 2.562-31.220).
CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic Bmi-1 expression, an absence of p16 expression, and
especially the combination of those 2 predictive markers were correlated
negatively with disease-specific and recurrence-free survival in patients with
oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, the current results indicate that these may be
applicable as predictive markers in combination with other factors to select
patients for more aggressive treatment and follow-up.
