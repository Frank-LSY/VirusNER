BACKGROUND: Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon-β
(VSV-IFN-β) has demonstrated antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In
preparation for clinical testing in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the
head and neck, we conducted preclinical studies of VSV-IFN-β in syngeneic SCC
models.
METHODS: In vitro, VSV-IFN-β (expressing rat or mouse interferon [IFN]-β)-induced
cytotoxicity and propagated in rat (FAT-7) or mouse (SCC-VII) SCC cells during
normoxia and hypoxia. In vivo, intratumoral administration of VSV-rat-IFN-β or
VSV-human-IFN-β in FAT-7 bearing or non-tumor bearing immunocompetent rats did
not result in acute organ toxicity or death.
RESULTS: VSV-r-IFN-β replicated predominantly in tumors and a dose dependent
anti-VSV antibody response was observed. Intratumoral or intravenous
administration of VSV-IFN-β resulted in growth delay and improved survival
compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: The above data confirm safety and feasibility of VSV-IFN-β
administration in immunocompetent animals and support its clinical evaluation in 
advanced human head and neck cancer.
