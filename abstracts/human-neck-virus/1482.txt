Human papilloma viruses (HPV) may cause head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
HPV associated carcinomas mostly occur in the oropharynx and particularly in the 
palatine tonsil and base of tongue. Carcinomas at other sites are infrequently
caused by HPV. The viral proteins E6 and E7 are crucial for malignant
transformation. They functionally interfere with cellular proteins maintaining
genomic integrity such as p53 and cell cycle control such as retinoblastoma
protein. However, unlike carcinogens such as tobacco smoke, the virus does not
disrupt the coding genes. Reliable HPV detection methods in histological
specimens include in situ hybridisation of high risk DNA and immunohistochemical 
detection of p16. HPV positivity does not proof a causal relation between HPV and
tumour. High risk HPV are also detectable in 10-20% of normal mucosal specimens. 
Irrespective of the various modalities available for treatment, HPV associated
head and neck cancers have a better prognosis than their carcinogen caused
counterparts. HPV positivity does not object to surgical treatment.
