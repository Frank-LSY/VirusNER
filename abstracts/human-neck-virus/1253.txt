BACKGROUND: Innate immune responses are fine-tuned by small noncoding RNA
molecules termed microRNAs (miRs) that modify gene expression in response to the 
environment. During acute infections, miRs can be secreted in extracellular
vesicles (EV) to facilitate cell-to-cell genetic communication. The purpose of
this study was to characterize the baseline population of miRs secreted in EVs in
the airways of young children (airway secretory microRNAome) and examine the
changes during rhinovirus (RV) infection, the most common cause of asthma
exacerbations and the most important early risk factor for the development of
asthma beyond childhood.
METHODS: Nasal airway secretions were obtained from children (â‰¤3 yrs. old) during
PCR-confirmed RV infections (n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 10). Nasal EVs
were isolated with polymer-based precipitation and global miR profiles generated 
using NanoString microarrays. We validated our in vivo airway secretory miR data 
in an in vitro airway epithelium model using apical secretions from primary human
bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI).
Bioinformatics tools were used to determine the unified (nasal and bronchial)
signature airway secretory miRNAome and changes during RV infection in children.
RESULTS: Multiscale analysis identified four signature miRs comprising the
baseline airway secretory miRNAome: hsa-miR-630, hsa-miR-302d-3p, hsa- miR-320e, 
hsa-miR-612. We identified hsa-miR-155 as the main change in the baseline
miRNAome during RV infection in young children. We investigated the potential
biological relevance of the airway secretion of hsa-mir-155 using in silico
models derived from gene datasets of experimental in vivo human RV infection.
These analyses confirmed that hsa-miR-155 targetome is an overrepresented pathway
in the upper airways of individuals infected with RV.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analysis of the airway secretory microRNAome in children
indicates that RV infection is associated with airway secretion of EVs containing
miR-155, which is predicted in silico to regulate antiviral immunity. Further
characterization of the airway secretory microRNAome during health and disease
may lead to completely new strategies to treat and monitor respiratory conditions
in all ages.
