Overall, head and neck sqamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 550,000
cases annually worldwide. It is well known that human papillomavirus (HPV) is the
main risk factor for cervical cancer development. As the incidence and the
mortality of cervical cancer are closely related to the HPV prevalence, we
hypothesized that there is the same association between HPV prevalence and head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore we performed the study aiming to
compare the level of HPV infection and HPV type distribution between two groups
of Lithuanian and Belarusian patients with head and neck sqamous cell carcinoma. 
One hundred ninety head and neck sqamous cell carcinoma patients were included in
the study, 75 from Lithuania and 115 from Belarus. PCR was used for HPV detection
and typing. The distribution of HPV infection among head and neck sqamous cell
carcinoma patients was similar in the Lithuanian (20.0%) and Belarusian (18.3%)
patient groups, however differences were found in the distribution of HPV types.
