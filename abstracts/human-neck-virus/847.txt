Using a human whole-genome DNA-microarray, we have examined the gene expression profiles in 15 HPV-negative and 15 transcriptionally-active HPV-positive OPSCCs. The study was conducted in two steps. Firstly, a learning/training-set consisting of 8 HPV16-positive and 8 HPV16-negative OPSCCs was analyzed to identify a specific signature. Potentially confounding factors (stage, sex and tobacco) were equally distributed in both groups. Subsequently the robustness of this signature was confirmed by blind case-by-case classification of a validation-set composed of the 14 remaining tumors.
