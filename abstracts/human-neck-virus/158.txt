The high level of manipulability of viral genome has set up HSV-1 to be an ideal 
viral vector for oncolytic virotherapy. In the past two decades, several
oncolytic HSV-1 viruses have been successfully developed and assessed in animal
studies. Accumulated evidences show that oncolytic HSV- 1 can efficiently infect 
many tumor cells and augment anti-tumor effect by induction of systemic innate
and adaptive immune responses. Inspiring results have been accomplished in
several phase I clinical trials for glioma, head and neck squeous cells carcinoma
and Melanoma using oncolytic HSV- 1 viruses. More recently, oncovey, one of
oncolytic HSV-1 viruses has been approved by FDA for the comprehensive evolution 
of its anti-tumor effects in phase III clinical trials. These promising studies
encourage more efforts to be devoted to craft the new generation of oncolytic
HSV-1. Herein, we will review and summarize the basic strategies to construct
oncolytic HSV-1 viruses and their applications in cancer therapy.
