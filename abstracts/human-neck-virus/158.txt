We included ART-naive subjects who had at least one follow-up ear, nose, and throat examination, and were diagnosed with lymph node mycobacterial infection before or during the first 3 months of ART initiation. Mycobacterial-associated IRIS in cervical lymph nodes was determined retrospectively through clinical case definition and medical chart review.
