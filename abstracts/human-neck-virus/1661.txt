De-escalation or de-intensification of therapy is discussed since many
retrospective analyses of former trials demonstrated significantly better outcome
for patients suffering from p16/HPV16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma of head and neck (OHNSCC). These observations are comprehensively
addressed, but the reader has to keep in mind that none of the currently
discussed data result from prospective controlled trials addressing the
HPV-discrimination in the primary endpoint design. Identification of the true
HPV16-related tumors is still challenging and in addition with different clinical
reports and lack of data of prospective trials not mature for routine clinical
decision making in 2016. Independent of the currently lacking evidence for
HPV-dependent treatment de-escalation, there are some relevant arguments to
address this question in ongoing and future trials.
