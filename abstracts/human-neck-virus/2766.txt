BACKGROUND: This study examined the prognostic significance of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from oropharyngeal and oral cavity
SCC (n = 143). The presence of functional HPV in tumour was determined by
combined assessments of p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridisation.
RESULTS: Oropharyngeal SCC patients presented with more advanced disease in
comparison with oral cavity SCC patients (P = 0.001). HPV is present in 60% and
61% of oropharyngeal and oral cavity SCC patients, respectively. HPV-positive
oropharyngeal SCC patients with advanced TNM stages displayed better overall and 
disease-free survival outcomes than HPV-negative patients (P = 0.022 and 0.046,
respectively). Such survival differences were not observed in oral cavity SCC.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV is common in both oropharyngeal and oral cavity SCC and is
associated with better survival outcome in oropharyngeal SCC but not in oral
cavity SCC patients.
