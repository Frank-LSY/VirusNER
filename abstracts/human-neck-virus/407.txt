BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been reported in up to 50% of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Presence of HPV in HNSCC has been
associated with more favorable prognosis.
OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to disclose HPV genotype distribution in head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and their role in disease outcome. In
addition, role of herpesviruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
as co-factors was elucidated.
STUDY DESIGN: HPV-genotyping of 106 HNSCC was done with Multimetrix(®)-kit.
Luminex-based-method was used to detect HSV-1 and -2 and CMV.
RESULTS: In males, 50% of HNSCC were HPV DNA positive and 25% of these were
multiple HPV-types infections and in women, 72% and 31%, respectively. Low-risk
(LR) HPV-types were found in 20.5% and co-infection with HSV-1 in 6.6%. Patients 
with HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC had similar survival. Patients not treated 
with chemoradiotherapy and co-infected with HSV-1 and HPV had a worse outcome.
Similarly patients with LR-HPVs treated with radiotherapy had a poor prognosis.
DISCUSSION: Radiotherapy for HNSCC in patients with either the presence of
LR-HPV-types or a co-infection with HPV and HSV-1 may result in poor outcome.
