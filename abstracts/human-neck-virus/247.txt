BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a heterogeneous group of viruses
classified into five genera. The beta-HPV type (beta-PV) infection is very common
but mostly asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, beta-PVs play a 
role in Epidermodysplasia verruciformis and possibly in non-melanoma skin cancer.
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a common cancer type worldwide and high-risk
alpha-PV involvement in HNC has been extensively studied but beta-PV types have
rarely been the focus of such studies.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of beta-PV types in HNC, subjects with
non-malignant or potentially pre-malignant oral lesions, and healthy controls.
STUDY DESIGN: The frequency of different beta-PVs in samples from oral (n=35) and
oropharyngeal (n=35) cancer patients, gender- and age-matched healthy controls
(n=70), and subjects with various non-malignant or potentially pre-malignant oral
lesions (n=102) was assessed by a highly sensitive, bead-based, multiplex
genotyping assay.
RESULTS: Overall, 54.8% of all tested samples contained at least one beta-PV
type. Even though the correlation between types found in lavage and tissue
specimens from cancer patients was low, there was a large statistically
significant difference between oropharyngeal cancer patients and matched controls
for HPV5 (P=0.003; OR=15.58) and between both oral (P=0.026; OR=5.7) and
oropharyngeal cancer patients (P=0.002; OR=25.5) and controls for HPV122. In
addition, there was no correlation between the prevalence of alpha and beta-PVs
in the study patients.
CONCLUSION: The study provides new data on the prevalence of beta-PVs in HNC.
HPV5 was found significantly associated with HNC as already observed by other
studies. Additionally, the significant association of HPV122 with HNC might
warrant further study as this type has not been extensively studied so far.
