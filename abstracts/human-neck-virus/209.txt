Membrane scission is the final step in all budding processes wherein a membrane
neck is sufficiently constricted so as to allow for fission and the release of
the budded particle. For influenza viruses, membrane scission is mediated by an
amphipathic helix (AH) domain in the viral M2 protein. While it is known that the
M2AH alters membrane curvature, it is not known how the protein is localized to
the center neck of budding virions where it would be able to cause membrane
scission. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations on buckled lipid bilayers
to show that the M2AH senses membrane curvature and preferentially localizes to
regions of high membrane curvature, comparable to that seen at the center neck of
budding influenza viruses. These results were then validated using in vitro
binding assays to show that the M2AH senses membrane curvature by detecting lipid
packing defects in the membrane. Our results show that the M2AH senses membrane
curvature and suggest that the AH domain may localize the protein at the viral
neck where it can then mediate membrane scission and the release of budding
viruses.
