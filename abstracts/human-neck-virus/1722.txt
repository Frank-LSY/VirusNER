BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive tumours. Overexpression of
p16 in HNC correlates with human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated HNC that carry 
a better prognosis than HPV-negative tumours. Angiogenesis is an important factor
in tumour progression. Our aim was to dissect the impact of p16 expression on
angiogenesis factors in HNC.
METHODS: Eighteen newly diagnosed HNC patients and controls were analysed. Eleven
pro- and anti-angiogenesis factors were quantified using multiplex ELISA in HNC
patients and controls. Angiogenesis factors were analysed in tumour tissue using 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Circulating levels of endostatin (anti-angiogenesis factor) were higher 
in the HNC group compared with healthy donors. Interestingly, the
pro-angiogenesis factors angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) were significantly higher in patients with p16-negative compared with
p16-positive HNC. Moreover, the major source of VEGF in p16-positive HNC tissue
was tumour stromal cells. In contrast, both tumour cells and stromal cells
expressed VEGF in p16-negative tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that p16-negative tumours associate with increased
circulating levels of pro-angiogenic VEGF and angiopoietin-1. Tissue expression
of VEGF differs between p16-positive and p16-negative tumours. These findings may
explain differences in the biological behaviour of p16-positive and p16-negative 
HNC. Better understanding of mechanisms by which the p16 status influences tumour
angiogenesis may guide the development of targeted therapies.
