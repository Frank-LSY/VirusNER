Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative factor for >90% of cervical
cancers and 25% of head and neck cancers. The incidence of HPV positive (+) head 
and neck squamous cell carcinomas has greatly increased in the last 30 years. E6 
and E7 are the two key viral oncoproteins that induce and propagate cellular
transformation. An immune response generated during cisplatin/radiation therapy
improves tumor clearance of HPV(+) cancers. Augmenting this induced response
during therapy with an adenoviral HPV16 E6/E7 vaccine improves long-term survival
in pre-clinical models. Here, we describe the generation of an HPV16 E6/E7
construct, which contains mutations that render E6/E7 non-oncogenic, while
preserving antigenicity. These mutations do not allow E6/E7 to degrade p53, pRb, 
PTPN13, or activate telomerase. Non-oncogenic E6/E7 (E6(Δ)/E7(Δ)) expressed as a 
stable integrant, or in the [E1-, E2b-] adenovirus, lacks the ability to
transform human cells while retaining the ability to induce an HPV-specific
immune response. Moreover, E6(Δ)/E7(Δ) plus chemotherapy/radiation statistically 
enhances clearance of established HPV(+) cancer in vivo.
