PURPOSE: Radiotherapy plays an integral role in the treatment of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although proteins involved in DNA repair may
predict HNSCC response to radiotherapy, none has been validated in this context. 
We examined whether differential expression of double-strand DNA break (DSB)
repair proteins in HNSCC, the chief mediators of DNA repair following
irradiation, predict for treatment outcomes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Archival HNSCC tumor specimens (n = 89) were assembled onto 
a tissue microarray and stained with antibodies raised against 38 biomarkers. The
biomarker set was enriched for proteins involved in DSB repair, in addition to
established mechanistic markers of radioresistance. Staining was correlated with 
treatment response and survival alongside established clinical and pathologic
covariates. Results were validated in an independent intramural cohort (n = 34).
RESULTS: Ku80, a key mediator of DSB repair, correlated most closely with
clinical outcomes. Ku80 was overexpressed in half of all tumors, and its
expression was independent of all other covariates examined. Ku80 overexpression 
was an independent predictor for both locoregional failure and mortality
following radiotherapy (P < 0.01). The predictive power of Ku80 overexpression
was confined largely to HPV-negative HNSCC, where it conferred a nine-fold
greater risk of death at two years.
CONCLUSIONS: Ku80 overexpression is a common feature of HNSCC, and is a candidate
DNA repair-related biomarker for radiation treatment failure and death,
particularly in patients with high-risk HPV-negative disease. It is a promising, 
mechanistically rational biomarker to select individual HPV-negative HNSCC
patients for strategies to intensify treatment.
