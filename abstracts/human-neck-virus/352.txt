OBJECTIVES: To understand knowledge of HPV, its association with head and neck
cancer (HNC), and source of knowledge in a high-risk population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among attendees at 
a Drag Racing event in East St. Louis in 2013.
RESULTS: Only 29.9% knew that HPV definitely increases the risk of developing
HNC, 42.4% thought HPV was same as HIV, and only 25.1% received HPV information
from a healthcare practitioner. Participants that thought number of sexual
partners did not increase risk of developing HPV were more likely to have low
knowledge scores (r=.74, p<.001). There were significant associations between HNC
knowledge, number of sexual partners, age at initial coitus, and risk perception;
and those who did not think having more sexual partner increases the chance of
developing HPV infection were 33times more likely to have lower knowledge of the 
association between HPV and HNC (OR=33.27; 95% CI: 16.34, 67.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of HPV and its association with head and neck cancer has
significant gaps in this population, with a large number of the population
accessing HPV information from sources other than a healthcare provider.
