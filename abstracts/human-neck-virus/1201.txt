BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of metastatic
melanoma. Patients with autoimmune conditions and/or on immunosuppressive therapy
due to orthotropic transplants, however, are systematically excluded from
clinical trials. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is the first oncolytic virus to
be approved by the FDA for cancer therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of T-VEC being administered in the setting of an organ transplant
recipient.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the case of a patient with recurrent locally
advanced cutaneous melanoma receiving salvage T-VEC therapy in the setting of
orthotropic heart transplantation. After 5 cycles of therapy, no evidence of
graft rejection has been observed to date, and the patient achieved a complete
remission, and is currently off therapy.
CONCLUSION: This case advocates for further investigation on the safety and
efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches, such as T-VEC, in solid organ
transplant recipients.
