OBJECTIVES: To review research addressing the polymicrobial aetiology of otitis
media in Indigenous Australian children in order to identify research gaps and
inform best practice in effective prevention strategies and therapeutic
interventions.
METHODS: Literature review.
RESULTS: Studies of aspirated middle-ear fluid represented a minor component of
the literature reviewed. Most studies relied upon specimens from middle-ear
discharge or the nasopharynx. Culture-based middle-ear discharge studies have
found that non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae
predominate, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus 
pyogenes isolated in a lower proportion of samples. Alloiococcus otitidis was
detected in a number of studies; however, its role in otitis media pathogenesis
remains controversial. Nasopharyngeal colonisation is a risk factor for otitis
media in Indigenous infants, and bacterial load of otopathogens in the
nasopharynx can predict the ear state of Indigenous children.
CONCLUSION: Most studies have used culture-based methods and specimens from
middle-ear discharge or the nasopharynx. Findings from these studies are
consistent with international literature, but reliance on culture may incorrectly
characterise the microbiology of this condition. Advances in genomic technologies
are now providing microbiologists with the ability to analyse the entire mixed
bacterial communities ('microbiomes') of samples obtained from Indigenous
children with otitis media.
