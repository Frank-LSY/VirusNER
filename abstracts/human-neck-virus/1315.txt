Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of head and neck is associated with high
morbidity and mortality in both Western and Asian countries. Several risk factors
for the development of oral cancer are very well established, including tobacco
chewing, betel quid, smoking, alcohol drinking and human papilloma virus (HPV)
infection. Apart from these risk factors, many genetic factors such as oncogenes,
tumor suppressor genes and regulatory genes are identified to involve in oral
carcinogenesis with these risk factors dependent and independent manner. Ras is
one of the most frequently genetically deregulated oncogene in oral cancer. In
this review, we analyze the past 22years of literature on genetic alterations
such as mutations and amplifications of the isoforms of the ras oncogene in oral 
cancer. Further, we addressed the isoform-specific role of the ras in oral
carcinogenesis. We also discussed how targeting the Akt and MEK, downstream
effectors of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, respectively, would probably pave
the possible molecular therapeutic target for the ras driven tumorigenesis in
oral cancer. Analysis of these ras isoforms may critically enlighten specific
role of a particular ras isoform in oral carcinogenesis, enhance prognosis and
pave the way for isoform-specific molecular targeted therapy in OSCC.
