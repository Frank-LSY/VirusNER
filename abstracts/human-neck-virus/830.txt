BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and effective in
preventing cervical cancer in females. As HPV infections can also induce cancers 
of the anus, penis and oral cavity, male vaccination is also advocated, but
systematic reviews on efficacy and safety in males are lacking.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review on the efficacy, effectiveness and
safety of HPV vaccination in males of any age. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from
inception to April 2017.
RESULTS: We identified 5196 articles and seven studies (four randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), three non-randomized studies) were included, comprising
a total of 5294 participants. Vaccine efficacy against at least 6-month
persisting anogenital HPV 16 infections was 46.9% (95% confidence interval (CI)
28.6-60.8%), whereas efficacy against persisting oral infections was 88% (2-98%).
A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4-82.8%) and 46.8% (- 20 to -77.9%) was observed 
against anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and grade 3 lesions, respectively.
No meaningful estimates were available on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness
against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were
identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancer. In
participants who were HPV-seronegative and PCR-negative at enrolment, efficacy
against all outcomes was higher as compared to seropositive and/or PCR-positive
individuals. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one, while the three 
non-randomized studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence quality was
moderate to low for most outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent 
anogenital HPV infection and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions in studies
where the population consists mainly of HPV-infected males. Vaccine effectiveness
was high in study groups comprising HPV-naïve males. This supports a
recommendation for vaccination of boys before the onset of sexual activity with
the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection. Mathematical
modelling studies will still be needed to assess the effects of adding males to
existing HPV vaccination programs in females.
