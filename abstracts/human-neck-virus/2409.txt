BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive and
lethal malignancy. Publically available cell lines are mostly of lingual origin, 
or have not been carefully characterized. Detailed characterization of novel
HNSCC cell lines is needed in order to provide researchers a concrete keystone on
which to build their investigations.
METHODS: The USC-HN1 cell line was established from a primary maxillary HNSCC
biopsy explant in tissue culture. The immortalized cells were then further
characterized by heterotransplantation in Nude mice; immunohistochemical staining
for relevant HNSCC biomarkers; flow cytometry for surface markers; cytogenetic
karyotypic analysis; human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus screening;
qRT-PCR for oncogene and cytokine analysis; investigation of activated, cleaved
Notch1 levels; and detailed 35,000 gene microarray analysis.
RESULTS: Characterization experiments confirmed the human HNSCC origin of
USC-HN1, including a phenotype similar to the original tumor. Viral screening
revealed no HPV or EBV infection, while western blotting displayed significant
upregulation of activated, cleaved Notch1.
CONCLUSIONS: USC-HN1, a novel immortalized cell line has been derived from a
maxillary HNSCC. Characterization studies have shown that the cell line is of
HNSCC origin and displays many of the same markers previously reported in the
literature. USC-HN1 is available for public research and will further the
investigation of HNSCC and the development of new therapeutic modalities.
