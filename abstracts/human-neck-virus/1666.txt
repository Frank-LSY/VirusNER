BACKGROUND: Extranodal (or extracapsular) extension (ENE) is an adverse
prognostic factor in patients with head and neck cancers who undergo primary
surgery. However, the significance of ENE in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established, and
single-institution studies have not established that ENE predicts inferior
outcome. The authors investigated the prognostic value of ENE in HPV-positive
patients who underwent primary surgery and whether adjuvant chemoradiation
improved overall survival (OS) compared with radiation alone in ENE-positive
patients.
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary surgery for pathologic T1 (pT1) through
pT4 tumors, pathologic N1 (pN1) through pN3 lymph node status, HPV-positive OPSCC
were identified in the National Cancer Data Base from 2010 through 2012. Features
associated with ENE were analyzed. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression
analyses identified predictors of OS. The effect of adjuvant treatment on OS in
ENE-positive cohort was also evaluated.
RESULTS: In total, 1043 patients met inclusion criteria, among whom 43.5% were
ENE-positive. Of the ENE-positive patients who had treatment details available,
72% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 16% received radiotherapy, and 12%
received no adjuvant treatment. After a median follow-up of 28.4 months, ENE was 
associated with worse 3-year OS (89.3% vs 93.6%; P = .01). On multivariable
analysis that included involved lymph nodes, only ENE, lymphovascular invasion,
pT3/pT4 tumors, and Charlson-Deyo score were associated with worse OS. Among
ENE-positive patients, there was no difference in 3-year OS between those who
received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (89.6%
vs 89.3%, respectively; P = .55). Propensity score-matched comparison revealed
similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: ENE is associated with inferior OS in patients with HPV-positive
OPSCC. However, OS was not better with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with
radiotherapy alone in ENE-positive patients. The current findings support the
need for prospective studies of adjuvant chemoradiation in HPV-positive patients 
with ENE. Cancer 2017;123:2762-72. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
