The incidence of head and neck cancer remains high and is associated with many deaths in both Western and Asian countries. Common risk factors in head and neck carcinoma are smoking and alcohol abuse, however, in an increasing proportion of cases, no significant smoking or drinking history has been reported. The infectious nature of oncogenic viruses sets them apart from other carcinogenic agents. As such, a thorough study of both the pathogenesis of viral infection and the host response is crucial to a full understanding of the resulting cancers. Such an understanding, in turn, has increased our knowledge of cellular pathways involved in growth and differentiation and neoplasia as a whole. Even though human oncogenic viruses belong to different virus families and utilize diverse strategies to contribute to cancer development, they share many common features. Viruses linked to cancers in humans are the human papilloma viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus and human herpesvirus-8. The potential role and involvement of these viruses in head and neck cancers along with brief description of vaccine development is provided.
