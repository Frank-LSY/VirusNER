PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) status
and known prognostic makers for head and neck cancers including tumor hypoxia,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and intratumoral T-cell levels
and to determine the prognostic impact of these markers by HPV status.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: HPV status in 82 evaluable head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas patients was determined by pyrosequencing and related to p16(INK4a)
staining and treatment outcomes. It was correlated with tumor hypoxia (tumor
pO(2) and carbonic anhydrase [CAIX] staining), EGFR status, and intratumoral
lymphocyte expression (CD3 staining).
RESULTS: Forty-four percent of evaluable tumors had strong HPV signal by
pyrosequencing. There was a significant relationship between strong HPV signal
and p16(INK4a) staining as well as oropharynx location. The strong HPV signal
group fared significantly better than others, both in time to progression (TTP, p
= 0.008) and overall survival (OS, p = 0.004) for all patients and for the
oropharyngeal subset. Positive p16(INK4a) staining was associated with better TTP
(p = 0.014) and OS (p = 0.00002). There was no relationship between HPV status
and tumor pO(2) or CAIX staining. However, HPV status correlated inversely with
EGFR reactivity (p = 0.0006) and directly with CD3(+) T-lymphocyte level (p =
0.03). Whereas CAIX and EGFR overexpression were negative prognostic factors
regardless of HPV status, CD3(+) T-cell levels was prognostic only in HPV(-)
tumors.
CONCLUSION: HPV status was a prognostic factor for progression and survival. It
correlated inversely with EGFR expression and directly with T-cell infiltration. 
The prognostic effect of CAIX and EGFR expression was not influenced by HPV
status, whereas intratumoral T-cell levels was significant only for HPV(-)
tumors.
