PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To assess the interaction of HPV/p16 status and therapy
rendered in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx 
and hypopharynx.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients receiving definitive
treatment between 2009 and 2011 for locally advanced larynx or hypopharynx cancer
with high-risk HPV and/or p16 testing performed were identified and
retrospectively investigated. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS),
and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 47 evaluable patients, there were 38 (81%) with laryngeal and 9 (19%)
with hypopharyngeal tumors, 13 (28%) of which were found to be either HPV or p16 
positive. At a median follow-up of 24 months, comparing HPV/p16+ versus HPV/p16- 
patients, there was no difference in OS, DFS, or LRFS. There was an improvement
in 2-year DFS (60% vs 100%, P=.03) and LRFS (80% vs 100%, P=.08), in HPV/p16+
patients treated with chemo/RT versus surgery. There was an improvement in 2-year
DFS (100% vs 68%, P=.04) and LRFS (100% vs 72%, P=.05) in HPV/p16+ versus
HPV/p16- patients who received chemo/RT.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPV/p16+ tumors fared more favorably with chemo/RT
than up-front surgery, with improvements in DFS and LRFS. In patients treated
with the intent of organ preservation therapy, HPV/p16+ patients had no observed 
treatment failures. HPV/p16 status should be taken into account when considering 
organ preservation for locally advanced larynx and hypopharynx cancers.
