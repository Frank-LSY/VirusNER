Acute pharyngotonsillitis is one of the most common diseases in children and
adolescents. The most frequent etiology is virus, followed by bacteria. The main 
bacterial agent is beta hemolytic Streptococcus group A. A rare complication of
pharyngeal infectious processes is septic thrombophlebitis of the internal
jugular vein. The diagnosis is suspected in the presence of an inflammatory
unilateral neck swelling. The diagnosis is confirmed by contrast computed
tomography. Treatment consists of prolonged administration of antibiotics, being 
the use of anticoagulants controversial. Early diagnosis and appropriate
treatment are essential to prevent persistent vascular occlusion and progression 
of the thrombus, which can cause pulmonary emboli. In the present study, we
present a teenager with thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein secondary
to acute streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. Clinical manifestations, diagnostic
methods and treatment of this rare vascular complication are described herein.
