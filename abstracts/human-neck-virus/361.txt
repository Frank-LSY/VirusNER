Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small circular DNA-virus and the high-risk types 16, 18 is implicated in oncogenesis of head and neck cancer--especially oropharynx (tonsil and base of tongue), poorly differentiated (the basaloid type), locoregional advanced stage, poorly differentiated, at the younger male, non-smokers, non-drinkers, sexual behaviors. The prognostic is favorable of human papillomavirus tumor status for patients with oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy (accelerated fractionation without total dose reduction). The impact of HPV-vaccination (ACIP 2007) decreasing the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer, but that patients HPV-positive, have good prognostic in generally (two-year overall survival: 95%, two-year progression-free survival: 88%), therefore HPV-vaccination in routine practice it is controversy.
