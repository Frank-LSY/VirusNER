AIM: To characterize the features of juvenile parotitis in a prospective setup
and epidemiology.
METHODS: All children with parotitis admitted to Helsinki University Central
Hospital 2005-2010 were recruited. Clinical characteristics, given treatment,
outcome, blood leukocyte count, C-reactive protein, serum amylase and
trypsinogen, SPINK-1 genotype and mumps antibodies were recorded. To map the
epidemiology, a questionnaire was sent to 1000 randomly selected 13-year-old
children.
RESULTS: The prospective study included 41 children (aged ≤ 17) with acute
parotitis, all in good general condition. Serum amylase, but not trypsinogen, was
elevated in majority of the cases (79%) and C-reactive protein in 68%. Eleven
(27%) children had an elevated blood leukocyte count. None had acute mumps. Most 
children recovered well, 51% being treated symptomatically only. Seven children
were treated on ward. Seventeen (46%) children had recurrent symptoms. One child 
(2.4%) had SPINK P55S mutation. According to the epidemiological questionnaire,
1.1% of the respondents (8/728, response rate 73%) reported a verified episode(s)
of parotitis.
CONCLUSION: Juvenile parotitis has a frequency close to 1%. In the majority, the 
general condition is good during the episode. Serum amylase serves as an
additional marker for the disease. Parotitis has a tendency to recur in almost
half of the cases.
