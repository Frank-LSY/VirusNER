BACKGROUND: Amidst a rising incidence of p16-positive (p16+) oropharyngeal
cancer, a significant number of cases present as regionally metastatic disease
with an "unknown" primary. Preliminary data support transoral surgery as an
effective method of primary detection/treatment.
METHODS: An observational cohort study of 65 p16+ unknown primary patients
treated with transoral surgery and neck dissection (2001-2012) was performed.
Adjuvant therapy and recurrence data were collected. Kaplan-Meier estimates were 
computed for disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The primary detection rate was 89% (58 of 65). Five-year DSS and OS were
98% and 97% for the detected group and 100% for the undetected, respectively.
Seventeen patients were treated with surgery alone. Of the 47 patients receiving 
adjuvant therapy, radiation to the pharynx was spared in 36.
CONCLUSION: The transoral approach was highly effective for the diagnosis and
treatment of the p16+ unknown primary and laid the foundation for deescalated
radiation by elimination of the pharyngeal field.
