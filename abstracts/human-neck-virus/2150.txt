BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for tonsillar squamous
cell carcinoma (TSCC) and the presence of HPV is correlated to a better clinical 
outcome. To find additional biomarkers that, together with HPV, predict clinical 
outcome, the aim of the present study was to evaluate epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) in relation to HPV status and
clinical outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 83 pre-treatment TSCC biopsies were analyzed
for EGFR and pEGFR Tyr1068 and Tyr1148 by immunohistochemistry, and the obtained 
data were tested for correlation to tumor HPV status and disease-free survival.
RESULTS: The presence of pEGFR Tyr1068 and 1148, both correlated significantly to
the absence of HPV. However, neither of these, nor total EGFR, correlated
significantly to disease-free survival for HPV-positive or HPV-negative TSCC.
CONCLUSION: Since pEGFR Tyr1068 and 1148 are correlated to absence of HPV but not
to clinical outcome, these may not be optimal prognostic markers for clinical
outcome in patients with TSCC.
