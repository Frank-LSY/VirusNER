Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is a common congenital infection that
causes sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Despite its substantial impact on
public health and cost burden, epidemiology and clinical features of CMV-related 
SNHL have never been reported in the Korean populations. This study investigated 
the detailed audiologic phenotypes of cCMV infection to see if a specific SNHL
pattern is associated with a particular clinical setting. A total of 38 patients 
with cCMV infection were studied retrospectively. Patients were classified into
three groups with distinct demographics: clinically driven diagnosis (n=17),
routine newborn CMV screening according to the NICU protocols (n=10), or referral
to ENT for cochlear implant (CI) (n=11). The incidence of cCMV infection was
3.6%, showing 33.3% of SNHL among cCMV patients, 38% of asymmetric hearing loss, 
29% of late-onset hearing loss, and diverse severity spectrum in patients with
CMV-related SNHL. CI recipients with CMV-related SNHL showed a significantly
improved speech perception. Surprisingly, in 36.4 % of CI implantees, initial
audiological manifestation was significant asymmetry of hearing thresholds
between both ears, with better ear retaining significant residual hearing up to
50dB. CMV turns out to be a significant etiology of SNHL, first to date reported 
in the Korean pediatric population. Analysis of audiologic phenotypes showed a
very wide spectrum of SNHL and favorable CI outcomes in case of profound
deafness. Especially for the patients with asymmetric hearing loss, close
surveillance of hearing should be warranted and CI could be considered on the
worse side first, based on the observation of rapid progression to profound
deafness of better side.
