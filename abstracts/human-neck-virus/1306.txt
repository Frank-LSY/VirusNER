BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the rate and type of p53
mutation in oropharyngeal cancer (OSCC). Relationships were sought between human 
papillomavirus (HPV) status and p53 mutation. The role of p53 mutation as a
prognostic factor independent of HPV status and as a modifier of the effect of
HPV on outcomes was also examined.
METHODS: The HPV status of 202 cases was determined by HPV DNA by RT-PCR and p16 
immunohistochemistry. P53 mutation in exon 5-8 was determined by pyrosequencing. 
Findings were correlated with known clinicopathological factors and outcomes.
RESULTS: 48% of the cases were HPV positive and they were significantly less
likely to have a p53 mutation than HPV-negative OSCCs (25.8% vs 46.7%, p=0.0021).
Mutation was most common in exon 5. Among patients with HPV-positive OSCC, there 
was no significant difference in p53 mutation by smoking status (22.2% for never 
smokers and 30.8% for current or ex-smokers). Patients with p53 mutant OSCC had
significantly worse overall survival (p=0.01). There was no statistical evidence 
that p53 mutation modified the effect of HPV status on outcomes. In the
multivariate analysis, positive HPV status remained the strongest predictor of
outcomes. p53 mutation status was not a significant predictor of outcome after
adjusting for age, gender, T stage, N stage and HPV status.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HPV-positive OSCC are less likely to have mutant p53
than HPV-negative OSCC. Our study did not show any evidence that p53 mutation
could modify the effect of HPV status on outcomes.
