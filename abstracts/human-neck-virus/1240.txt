BACKGROUND: Amplification of the MYC gene is reported to be associated with the
development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study is
focused to analyze the correlation between MYC gene amplification and various
clinicopathological features and outcome in a cohort of 49 dysplastic and 187
primary head and neck lesions.
METHODS: MYC gene amplification was assessed by differential polymerase chain
reaction using primer sets from the MYC gene as target locus and DRD2 gene as the
control locus.
RESULT: The MYC gene amplification was detected in a total of 23.7% (56/236) head
and neck lesions comprising 14.2% (7/49) dysplastic lesions and 26% (49/187)
HNSCC samples. The clinicopathological association study between MYC gene
amplification with the different clinical parameters like sex, tumor stage, tumor
differentiation, lymph node status, tobacco habit and HPV 16/18 status determined
significant association of MYC amplification with tumor progression (P = 0.009). 
Kaplan Meier analysis revealed MYC gene has no prognostic significance on
survival in HNSCC.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest that MYC gene amplification is
associated with tumor progression in HNSCC.
