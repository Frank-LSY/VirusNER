BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) is endemic
in East Africa. Recent, dramatic, increases in the incidence of oropharyngeal
cancer in the United States and Europe are linked to the same high risk HPV
genotypes responsible for cervical cancer. Currently, there is extremely limited 
data regarding the role of HPV in head and neck cancers in Africa. Evidence of
HPV as an etiologic agent in head and neck cancers in Africa would have important
prevention and treatment implications.
METHODS: A retrospective single institution review of oral tongue and
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed between 2005 and 2013 was
performed. Individual case data for 51 patients with biopsy proven squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) from the oropharynx (n=22) and oral tongue (n=29) were
identified. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded biopsy samples were obtained and
evaluated for p16 by immunohistochemistry and HPV genotype 16 specific oncogenes,
E6 and E7, by PCR.
RESULTS: All of the positive controls, but none of the oropharyngeal samples
stained positively for p16. Two of the oral tongue samples stained positive for
p16. None of the oropharyngeal or oral tongue cases demonstrated PCR products for
HPV-16 E6 or E7.
CONCLUSIONS: Though Mozambique has extremely high levels of HPV positive cervical
cancer this study demonstrates an absence of HPV positive oropharyngeal or oral
tongue squamous cell carcinoma within biopsy samples from a single referral
hospital in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique.
