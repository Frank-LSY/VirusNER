An 11-year-old boy presented with inability to move his right arm, back and neck 
pain, and fever. He had a history of recurrent vesicular rash on his face three
times over the past two years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse
expansile cervical cord, leading to a diagnosis of transverse myelitis. After 3
days of intravenous solumedrol, the patient was discharged, but returned the
following day with a vesicular rash to the right arm, as well as vomiting,
malaise and diffuse pruritus.Wright-Giemsa stain of the vesicles revealed herpes 
group virus and culture was positive for herpes simplex type 1.
