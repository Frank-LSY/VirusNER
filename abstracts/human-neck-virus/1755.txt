BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals (HIVIIs) have a
higher incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and clinical
and histopathological differences have been observed in their tumors in
comparison with those of HNSCC patients without a human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection. The reasons for these differences are not clear, and molecular
differences between HIV-related HNSCC and non-HIV-related HNSCC may exist. This
study compared the mutational patterns of HIV-related HNSCC and non-HIV-related
HNSCC.
METHODS: The DNA of 20 samples of HIV-related HNSCCs and 32 samples of
non-HIV-related HNSCCs was sequenced. DNA libraries covering exons of 18 genes
frequently mutated in HNSCC (AJUBA, CASP8, CCND1, CDKN2A, EGFR, FAT1, FBXW7,
HLA-A, HRAS, KEAP1, NFE2L2, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NSD1, PIK3CA, TGFBR2, TP53, and TP63)
were prepared and sequenced on an Ion Personal Genome Machine sequencer. DNA
sequencing data were analyzed with Ion Reporter software. The human
papillomavirus (HPV) status of the tumor samples was assessed with in situ
hybridization, the MassARRAY HPV multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, and
p16 immunostaining. Mutation calls were compared among the studied groups.
RESULTS: HIV-related HNSCC revealed a distinct pattern of mutations in comparison
with non-HIV-related HNSCC. TP53 mutation frequencies were significantly lower in
HIV-related HNSCC. Mutations in HIV+ patients tended to be TpC>T nucleotide
changes for all mutated genes but especially for TP53.
CONCLUSIONS: HNSCC in HIVIIs presents a distinct pattern of genetic mutations,
particularly in the TP53 gene. HIV-related HNSCC may have a distinct biology, and
an effect of the HIV virus on the pathogenesis of these tumors should not be
ruled out. Cancer 2018;124:84-94. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
