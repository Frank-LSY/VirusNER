In this study, high-risk HPV (hrHPV) incidence, prognostic biomarkers, and
outcome were assessed in HIV-positive (case) and HIV-negative (control) patients 
with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). HIV-positive cases were matched 
to controls by tumor site, sex, and age at cancer diagnosis. A tissue microarray 
(TMA) was constructed and DNA isolated from tumor tissue. MultiPlex-PCR
MassArray, L1-PCR, and in situ hybridization were used to assess hrHPV. TMA
sections were stained for p16ink4a, TP53, RB, CCND1, EGFR, and scored for
intensity and proportion of positive tumor cells. The HNSCC cohort included 41
HIV-positive cases and 41 HIV-negative controls. Tumors from 11 of 40 (28%)
cases, and 10 of 41 (24%) controls contained hrHPV. p16 expression, indicative of
E7 oncogene activity, was present in 10 of 11 HPV-positive cases and 7 of 10
HPV-positive controls. Low p16 and high TP53 expression in some HPV-positive
tumors suggested HPV-independent tumorigenesis. Survival did not differ in cases 
and controls. RB expression was significantly associated with poor survival (P = 
0.01). High TP53 expression exhibited a trend for poorer survival (P = 0.12), but
among cases, association with poor survival reached statistical significance (P =
0.04). The proportion of HPV-positive tumors was similar, but the heterogeneity
of HPV types was higher in the HIV-positive cases than in HIV-negative controls. 
High RB expression predicted poor survival, and high TP53 expression was
associated with poorer survival in the HIV-positive cases but not HIV-negative
controls.IMPLICATIONS: HIV infection did not increase risk of death from HNSCC,
and HPV-positive tumors continued to be associated with a significantly improved 
survival, independent of HIV status. Mol Cancer Res; 15(2); 179-88. ©2016 AACR.
