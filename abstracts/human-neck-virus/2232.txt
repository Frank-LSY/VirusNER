HPV-related (HPV+) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) has a better prognosis compared to 
HPV unrelated (HPV-) OPC. This review summarizes and discusses several of the
controversies regarding the management of HPV+ OPC, including the mechanism of
its treatment sensitivity, modern surgical techniques, chemotherapy regimens, and
treatment de-intensification protocols. We also discuss and reconsider potential 
adverse prognostic factors such as tumor EGFR expression, tumor hypoxia, and
patient smoking history, as well as the significance of retropharyngeal
adenopathy. Finally, we discuss elective nodal treatment of uninvolved lymph node
stations. While this review does not exhaust all controversies related to the
management of HPV+ OPC, it aims to highlight some of the most clinically relevant
ones.
