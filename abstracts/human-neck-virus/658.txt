Influenza causes an acute infection characterized by virus replication in
respiratory epithelial cells. The severity of influenza and other respiratory
diseases changes over the life course and during pregnancy in women, suggesting
that sex steroid hormones, such as estrogens, may be involved. Using primary,
differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures from adult male and
female donors, we exposed cultures to the endogenous 17β-estradiol (E2) or select
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and then infected cultures with a seasonal
influenza A virus (IAV) to determine whether estrogenic signaling could affect
the outcome of IAV infection and whether these effects were sex dependent.
Estradiol, raloxifene, and bisphenol A decreased IAV titers in hNECs from female,
but not male, donors. The estrogenic decrease in viral titer was dependent on the
genomic estrogen receptor-2 (ESR2) as neither genomic ESR1 nor nongenomic GPR30
was expressed in hNEC cultures and addition of the genomic ER antagonist ICI
182,780 reversed the antiviral effects of E2. Treatment of hNECs with E2 had no
effect on interferon or chemokine secretion but significantly downregulated cell 
metabolic processes, including genes that encode for zinc finger proteins, many
of which contain estrogen response elements in their promoters. These data
provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how natural 
and synthetic estrogens impact IAV infection in respiratory epithelial cells
derived from humans.
