Oral exfoliated cells were collected from OSCC cases and non-cancer controls. Cells from tumor lesions were taken from OSCC patients for further strong confirmation of the association of EBV with OSCC. EBV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for EBV DNA polymerase. The EBV DNA positive samples were confirmed further by nested PCR.
