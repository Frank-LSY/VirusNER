BACKGROUND: We report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with
relapsed/refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma and liver failure with
encephalopathy along with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome infection, successfully treated with nivolumab without major side
effects and encouraging prolonged disease control.
CASE PRESENTATION: In December 2015, at the time of the patient's progression
from his Hodgkin lymphoma after fourth line treatment, he developed persistent
fevers, abdominal distension, jaundice and worsening of his liver function tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging of abdomen/pelvis demonstrated hepatomegaly with
innumerable new liver lesions, splenomegaly with multiple splenic nodules and
several new mediastinal, intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. In 
accordance with the patient's wishes before admission, and after agreement with
the family, nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was given. Of note, antiretroviral 
therapy was on hold due to liver function tests, his viral load was undectable
and cluster of differentiation 4 counts were 103/uL at the time of nivolumab
administration. One week after the first dose of nivolumab both his hepatic
encephalopathy and constitutional symptoms started to improve, and after 2 doses,
(January 2016) his LFTs were almost back to normal. After 5 months of nivolumab
treatment (10 doses), restaging (computerized tomography scans of neck, chest,
abdomen, pelvis) done on May 2016 showed resolution of hepatosplenomegaly with
two residual small hepatic lesions, heterogeneous spleen with no splenic lesions,
and stable non-enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes without intraabdominal
lymphadenopathy; consistent with partial response.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of a patient with human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome -related relapsed/refractory classical
Hodgkin lymphoma and acute liver failure with encephalopathy successfully treated
with nivolumab after failing all standard therapeutic options. Unlike classic
cytotoxic chemotherapy, which relies on preserved organ function to ameliorate
potential severe side effects (i.e. myelosuppression), elimination of monoclonal 
antibodies is fairly independent of baseline renal and hepatic function since
they are usually metabolized by circulating phagocytes and/or by their target
antigen-expressing cell.
