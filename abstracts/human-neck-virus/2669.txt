OBJECTIVES: Carotid artery aneurysms, although rare, are increasing in frequency 
due to their association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Our
institution serves a population with a high HIV prevalence and we wished to
document our growing experience with this aneurysmal pathology in a setting of an
ever-increasing burden of HIV disease.
METHODS: Data on all patients managed at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital
in Durban, South Africa, from July 2003 to December 2009 with HIV carotid
aneurysms were extracted from a prospective vascular database and their case
records were examined. Twenty-two patients were identified of whom 21 had
preoperative imaging and underwent some form of intervention.
RESULTS: The initial presentation in 19 of the 22 patients was a progressively
enlarging neck mass and pain. Ten patients presented with neurology with only 1
patient presenting with a hemiplegia and 1 patient with a monoplegia. Sixteen
patients had an open operative repair and 5 patients had an endovascular repair
performed as the initial procedure. Of the open procedure, 8 patients had an
interposition graft used and 8 had ligation of the common carotid artery (CCA),
external carotid artery (ECA), and/or internal carotid artery (ICA). Eighteen
patients had no immediate postoperative neurological complications. The worst
outcomes were from patients who underwent an endovascular procedure. These
included one death, two thrombosed stents, and one endoleak. Histology showed
active tuberculosis (TB) in 6 patients who were not known to have TB
preoperatively. The overall mortality was 3 of 22 patients.
CONCLUSION: We have noted aneurysms of the carotid artery to occur in patients
who are infected with HIV and it seems to be that the incidence of such aneurysms
is more common than documented. Open surgical intervention either in the form of 
an interposition graft or ligation seems to be the more effective treatment
option as compared to endovascular stenting. Stenting should be reserved for
those patients unfit for open surgery.
