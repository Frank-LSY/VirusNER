Our results did not show a significantly different incidence of contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases between HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. T4 stage and tongue base location, however, were associated with contralateral disease. These data suggest treatment of bilateral necks might be warranted in these cases, regardless of HPV status.
