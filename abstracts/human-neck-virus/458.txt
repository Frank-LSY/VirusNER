OBJECTIVE: Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common pediatric problem; reactive
hyperplasia, specific infective agents, and malignancy are mainly the
differential diagnosis. The aim of our study was to detect the prevalence of
Epstein-Barr virus infection among children who complained of cervical
lymphadenopathy and also to evaluate the clinical manifestations of the disease
in pediatric patients.
METHODS: One hundred and sixty children presented with cervical lymphadenopathy
were subjected to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) serology testing. Cases that showed
positivity to heterophile antibody test, and/or EBV-specific antibodies; IgM
against viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgM) and IgG against viral capsid antigen
(VCA-IgG) were evaluated clinically for manifestations of the disease.
RESULTS: Twenty-four cases (15%) showed positivity to EBV serology, all of them
had posterior cervical lymph nodes enlargement, 70.8% had fever, 66.6% had
tonsillo-pharyngitis, 58.3% had splenomegaly, 25% had hepatomegaly, 41.6% had
generalized lymphadenopathy, while skin rash was detected in 12.5%, and both
palatal petechiae and palpebral edema were detected in 8.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV infection is not a rare cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in
children. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy in pediatric age group may represent
a password for suspicion of EBV infection, while other clinical manifestations of
the disease may include hepato-splenomegaly, skin rash, palpebral edema and
palatal petechiae.
