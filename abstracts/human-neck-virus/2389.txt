Head and neck cancers usually present with advanced disease and novel therapies
are urgently needed. Genetic therapy aims at restoring malfunctioned tumor
suppressor gene(s) or introducing proapoptotic genes. Oncolytic virotherapeutics 
induce multiple cycles of cancer-specific virus replication, followed by
oncolysis, virus spreading and infection of adjacent cancer cells. Oncolytic
viruses can also be armed to express therapeutic transgene(s). Recent advances in
preclinical and clinical studies are revealing the potential of both therapeutic 
classes for advanced head and neck cancers, including the approval of two
products (Gendicine and H101) by a governmental agency. This review summarizes
the available clinical data to date and discusses the challenges and future
directions.
