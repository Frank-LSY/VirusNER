BACKGROUND: Data collection by electronic medical record (EMR) systems have been 
proven to be helpful in data collection for scientific research and in improving 
healthcare. For a multi-centre trial in Indonesia and the Netherlands a web based
system was selected to enable all participating centres to easily access data.
This study assesses whether the introduction of a clinical trial data management 
service (CTDMS) composed of electronic case report forms (eCRF) can result in
effective data collection and treatment monitoring.
METHODS: Data items entered were checked for inconsistencies automatically when
submitted online. The data were divided into primary and secondary data items. We
analysed both the total number of errors and the change in error rate, for both
primary and secondary items, over the first five month of the trial.
RESULTS: In the first five months 51 patients were entered. The primary data
error rate was 1.6%, whilst that for secondary data was 2.7% against acceptable
error rates for analysis of 1% and 2.5% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The presented analysis shows that after five months since the
introduction of the CTDMS the primary and secondary data error rates reflect
acceptable levels of data quality. Furthermore, these error rates were decreasing
over time. The digital nature of the CTDMS, as well as the online availability of
that data, gives fast and easy insight in adherence to treatment protocols. As
such, the CTDMS can serve as a tool to train and educate medical doctors and can 
improve treatment protocols.
