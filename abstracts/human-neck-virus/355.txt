OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) is
associated with a certain subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC)-namely, those arising in the oropharynx. The objective of this study is
to determine the efficacy, detection, and genotype of high-risk (HR) HPV using
the Roche cobas 4800 system (Roche Molecular System, Pleasanton, CA).
METHODS: Forty-two fine-needle aspirate (FNA) specimens from 37 patients with
cervical (n = 36) or mediastinal (n = 5) lymphadenopathy or a left parapharyngeal
mass (n =1) were included in this prospective study. HR-HPV testing was performed
on residual FNA material after direct smear preparation and, if positive, was
further delineated into HPV 16/18 genotypes using the Roche cobas 4800 system.
Follow-up included review of histologic material and/or electronic health
records.
RESULTS: Among those HNSCCs that were positive for HR-HPV, 18 (100%) of 18
originated from the oropharynx, whereas only two (13%) of 15 HR-HPV-negative
HNSCCs originated from the oropharynx (χ(2) test, P < .05). p16
immunohistochemical assay and HPV 16 in situ hybridization on corresponding
histologic specimens were concordant with cytologic HR-HPV results.
CONCLUSIONS: HR-HPV detection and genotyping can be performed on lymph node FNAs 
with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma using the Roche cobas 4800 system. The
presence of HR-HPV and/or HPV 16 is a reliable indicator of the metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma originating from the oropharynx.
