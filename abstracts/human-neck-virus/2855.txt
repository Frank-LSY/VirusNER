Follicular mucinosis is recognized as one of the histopathological reaction
patterns characterized by the accumulation of mucin within follicular epithelium.
It is induced by various causes including inflammatory diseases, and more than
half of the cases are associated with malignant lymphoma, mainly mycosis
fungoides. Herein, we describe the third documented case of adult T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) accompanying follicular mucinosis. A 72-year-old
Japanese male presented with persistent erythema in his arm and neck. Laboratory 
tests demonstrated positivity for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1
antibodies. Histopathological study of the biopsy specimen from the neck revealed
superficial perivascular, nodular, and intrafollicular lymphocytic infiltrations.
These lymphocytes were small- to medium-sized and had convoluted nuclei. Mucoid
material deposition was observed within the hair follicles, and it was digested
by hyaluronidase. Immunohistochemically, these lymphocytes were positive for CD3,
CD4, CD25, and Foxp3. Accordingly, an ultimate diagnosis of ATLL accompanying
follicular mucinosis was made. The skin is the most common extralymphatic site of
involvement of ATLL. The present case clearly demonstrated that albeit extremely 
rare, ATLL can cause follicular mucinosis. Therefore, ATLL should be included in 
the differential diagnostic consideration of follicular mucinosis.
