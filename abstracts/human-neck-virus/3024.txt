INTRODUCTION: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the salivary glands is
extremely rare worldwide, with studies limited to small case reports and case
series from endemic areas (Southern China, Arctic Inuits) and strong association 
to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Studies on non-endemic regions are even more limited
given the reality of only sporadic cases in these areas. Using the National
Cancer Database (NCDB), we present the largest study on salivary LEC from a
non-endemic region, the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the NCDB from 1998-2012 for LEC of the major
salivary glands was performed. Demographic and clinical variables were extracted 
for analysis. Multivariate COX regression was used to assess predictors of
survival.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight cases were identified (0.66% of all
salivary cancers). Median age at diagnosis was 62 with peak incidence in ages
50-70. Most patients were Caucasian (81.2%), without gender preference. Regional 
metastasis was common (45.1%) and did not significantly impact survival. Distant 
metastasis was rare (2%). Overall survival (OS) at 5- and 10 years was 77% and
56%. Surgery and radiotherapy significantly showed better survival outcomes than 
surgery alone (p<0.001). Age >62, advanced stage, and dual modality therapy were 
significant predictors of survival in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma in the US mostly affects an older,
Caucasian demographic. Regional metastasis is common and survival is fair at 5-
and 10 years. Surgery and radiation are recommended for early and advanced
disease stages. Age, stage, and therapy are significant predictors of survival
outcomes.
