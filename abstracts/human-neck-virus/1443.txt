RNA in-situ hybridization is a practical and effective method for determining HPV
status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma including discordant cases that
are p16 positive by immunohistochemistry but HPV negative by DNA in-situ
hybridization.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of human papillomavirus (HPV) status in oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has become increasingly important for
prognostication and clinical trial enrollment. This assessment is confounded in
OPSCCs that are p16 positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) but HPV negative by
DNA in situ hybridization (DISH). This study evaluates whether E6/E7 mRNA in situ
hybridization (RISH) can detect transcriptionally active HPV in these problematic
cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases
that had previously undergone p16 IHC and HPV DISH were evaluated with two RISH
platforms and a second-generation DISH probe. The study included 21 p16+/DISH+
concordant cases, 19 p16-/DISH- concordant cases, and 42 p16+/DISH- discordant
cases.
RESULTS: RISH identified E6/E7 mRNA in 37 (88%) p16+/DISH- cases, 21 (100%)
p16+/DISH+ cases, and 0 (0%) p16-/DISH- cases. RISH signals were clearly visible 
at low to medium magnification in 97% of positive cases, facilitating
almost-perfect inter-observer reproducibility. The performance of the manual and 
automated RISH platforms were equivalent (kappa=0.915). Only 29% of carcinomas
that demonstrated E6/E7 mRNA transcriptional activity were positive using the 2nd
generation DISH probe.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV RISH is a highly sensitive and specific platform that can
clarify the HPV status of those perplexing OPSCCs that are p16 positive by IHC
but HPV negative by DISH. Moreover, it is easy to interpret, readily adaptable to
the clinical laboratory, and provides direct evidence of HPV transcriptional
activity. E6/E7 RISH should be considered as a first-line platform for
determination of HPV status in OPSCCs.
