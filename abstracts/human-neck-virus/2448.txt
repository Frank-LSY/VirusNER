PURPOSE: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy in the developed world with just more
than 1,600 new cases diagnosed in the United States per year; however, the
incidence is much higher in developing countries. Although HPV is known to
contribute to tumorigenesis, little is known about the genetic or epigenetic
alterations defining penile cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using high-density genome-wide methylation arrays, we have
identified epigenetic alterations associated with penile cancer. Q-MSP was used
to validate lymph node metastasis markers in 50 cases. A total of 446 head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESCC)
samples were used to validate HPV-associated epigenetic alterations.
RESULTS: We defined 6,933 methylation variable positions (MVP) between normal and
tumor tissue, which includes 997 hypermethylated differentially methylated
regions associated with tumor supressor genes, including CDO1, AR1, and WT1.
Analysis of penile cancer tumors identified a 4 gene epi-signature which
accurately predicted lymph node metastasis in an independent cohort (AUC of 89%).
Finally, we explored the epigenetic alterations associated with penile cancer HPV
infection and defined a 30 loci lineage-independent HPV specific epi-signature
which predicts HPV status and survival in independent HNSCC, CESC cohorts.
Epi-signature-negative patients have a significantly worse overall survival
[HNSCC P = 0.00073; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.021-0.78; CESC P = 0.0094; HR
= 3.91, 95% CI = 0.13-0.78], HPV epi-signature is a better predictor of survival 
than HPV status alone.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate for the first time genome-wide epigenetic
events involved in an aggressive penile cancer phenotype and define the
epigenetic alterations common across multiple HPV-driven malignancies.
