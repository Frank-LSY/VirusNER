MicroRNAs have the ability to alter and regulate multiple genes, including RTK
family members, making them an attractive approach for molecular therapeutic
development. We use a pCDNA6.2-EmGFP-microRNA expression vector to overexpress
individual mature microRNA and then transfer the expression cassette into a
single, inducible lentiviral vector (pINDUCER20). We successfully use this system
to create a pINDUCER-EmGFP-miRNA27a expression vector and generate a stable head 
and neck cancer cell line (UM-SCC-22A) that inducibly expresses miRNA-27a,
resulting in targeted epidermal growth factor receptor down regulation. In this
chapter, we describe the protocol for engineering the pINDUCER-EmGFP-microRNA
expression vector, producing lentiviral particles for target cell infection, and 
evaluating downregulation of gene expression.
