Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is among a spectrum of viruses known to affect the
upper aerodigestive tract. Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are the most common 
clinical manifestations of first-episode HSV infection, whereas recurrent herpes 
labialis is the most common clinical manifestation of reactivation HSV infection.
Herpetic viral infections seldom attack the larynx. Laryngeal disorders provoked 
by the herpes virus are characterised by a large spectrum of presentations and
polymorphisms, and can simulate mucous lesions such as an extensive laryngeal
neoplasm (supraglottic tumour). We report a case of a 69-year-old woman, smoker, 
who presented with a large ulcerated supraglottic mass mimicking laryngeal
cancer, requiring emergency tracheostomy for worsening stridor, which turned out 
to be an HSV laryngitis superimposed onto an underlying Streptococcus A lower
respiratory tract infection. The patient was treated for Streptococcus A
infection and her symptoms resolved following treatment. Patient's tracheotomy
tube was removed on follow-up appointment.
