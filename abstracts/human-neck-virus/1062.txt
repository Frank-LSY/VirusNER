Patients with neck squamous cell carcinomas of unknown primary tumour (NSCCUP)
present with lymph node metastasis without evidence for a primary tumour. Most
patients undergo an aggressive multimodal treatment, which induces severe,
potentially unnecessary toxicity. Primary tumours of NSCCUP can be hidden in the 
oropharynx. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally involved in a subgroup of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) associated with early lymph node
metastasis and good prognosis. Detection of markers for HPV transformation in
NSCCUP could allow focussing on the oropharynx in primary tumour search and could
be of value for choice and extent of treatment. In a retrospective multicentre
study (Germany, Italy and Spain), we analysed metastatic lymph nodes from 180
NSCCUP patients for the presence of HPV DNA, HPV E6*I mRNA and cellular p16INK4a 
overexpression, a surrogate marker for HPV-induced transformation. HPV status,
defined as positivity for viral mRNA with at least one additional marker, was
correlated with clinical parameters and survival outcome. A substantial
proportion (16%) of NSCCUP were HPV-driven, mainly by HPV16 (89%). HPV prevalence
increased with year of diagnosis from 9% during 1998-2004 to 23% during 2005-2014
(p = 0.007). HPV-driven NSCCUP had significantly better overall and
progression-free survival rates (p ≤ 0.008). Based on this survival benefit, it
is contended that HPV RNA status should be included in NSCCUP diagnosis and in
therapeutic decision-making. Deintensification of radiation in patients with
HPV-driven NSCCUP, while concurrently concentrating on the oropharynx appears to 
be a promising therapeutic strategy, the efficacy of which should be assessed in 
prospective trials. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on HPV in NSCCUP.
