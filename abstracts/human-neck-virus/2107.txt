BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) tumor status and surgical salvage are
associated with improved prognosis for patients with recurrent oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Current data regarding types of surgery and the 
impact of surgery for patients with distant metastatic disease are limited.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent OPSCC from 2
institutions between 2000 and 2012 was performed. p16 immunohistochemistry and/or
in situ hybridization, as clinically available, were used to determine HPV tumor 
status. Clinical characteristics, distribution of recurrence site, and treatment 
modalities were compared by HPV tumor status. Overall survival (OS) was examined 
using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods.
RESULTS: The current study included 108 patients with 65 locoregional and 43
distant metastatic first recurrences. The majority of patients were HPV-positive 
(80 patients). HPV-positive tumor status was associated with longer time to
disease recurrence (P<.01). Anatomic site distribution of disease recurrences did
not differ by HPV tumor status. HPV-positive tumor status (adjusted HR [aHR],
0.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.09-0.58 [P = .002]), longer time to
disease recurrence (≥ 1 year; aHR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.74 [P = .006]), and
surgical salvage (aHR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.61 [P = .002]) were found to be
independently associated with OS after disease recurrence. Surgical salvage was
independently associated with improved OS compared with nonsurgical treatment
among patients with both locoregional (aHR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.56 [P = .005])
and distant (aHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.75 [P = .018]) metastatic disease
recurrences.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical salvage was found to be associated with improved OS for
patients with recurrent locoregional and distant metastatic OPSCC, independent of
HPV tumor status. Further prospective data are needed to confirm the role of
surgical salvage for distant metastases.
