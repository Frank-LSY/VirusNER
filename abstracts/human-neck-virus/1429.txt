APOBEC3B cytosine deaminase activity has recently emerged as a significant
mutagenic factor in human cancer. APOBEC activity is induced in virally infected 
cells, and APOBEC signature mutations occur at high frequency in cervical cancers
(CESC), over 99% of which are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). We tested
whether APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is particularly important in HPV-associated
tumors by comparing the exomes of HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCCs) sequenced by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. As expected,
HPV- HNSCC displays a smoking-associated mutational signature, whereas our data
suggest that reduced exposure to exogenous carcinogens in HPV+ HNSCC creates a
selective pressure that favors emergence of tumors with APOBEC-mediated driver
mutations. Finally, we provide evidence that APOBEC activity is responsible for
the generation of helical domain hot spot mutations in the PIK3CA gene across
multiple cancers. Our findings implicate APOBEC activity as a key driver of
PIK3CA mutagenesis and HPV-induced transformation.
