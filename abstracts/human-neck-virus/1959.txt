BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, the patterns of care for the
radiotherapy-based treatment of patients with stage III to IVB oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are poorly defined. The objective of the current 
study was to characterize the use and predictors of chemotherapy with
radiotherapy for this population using the National Cancer Database.
METHODS: Patients in the National Cancer Database with AJCC (American Joint
Committee on Cancer) stage III to IV OPSCC who were treated with radiotherapy
between 2003 and 2012 were eligible for analysis. Treatment was defined as
radiotherapy alone, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or induction chemotherapy (IC).
Multivariable regression with multilevel modeling was used to determine
predictors of any chemotherapy use and, among patients receiving chemotherapy,
the predictors of IC.
RESULTS: The majority (90%) of the 30,875 eligible patients received
chemotherapy, the majority of whom (71% of the total) were treated with
definitive chemoradiotherapy; a sizeable percentage of patients received IC (19% 
of total). On multivariable regression, younger age, favorable comorbidity
status, and more advanced tumor and lymph node disease were found to be
independent predictors of any chemotherapy and IC use. Nonwhite patients (odds
ratio [OR], 0.71; P<.0001), women (OR, 0.74; P<.0001), and individuals without
private insurance were found to be significantly less likely to receive
chemotherapy. Patients treated at higher-volume institutions were significantly
less likely to receive IC (OR, 0.69; P = .0006). Human papillomavirus status did 
not appear to independently influence treatment choice.
CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of patients with stage III to IVB OPSCC who were
treated with definitive radiotherapy received chemotherapy, which is consistent
with high-level data and national recommendations. However, disparities with
regard to race, sex, and insurance status emerged thereby requiring additional
investigation. The frequent use of IC despite limited supportive evidence
warrants research on physician and patient decision making and presents an
opportunity to improve evidence-based treatment delivery. Cancer
