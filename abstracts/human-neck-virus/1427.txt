Among head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the incidence of
oropharyngeal SCC (OPSCC) is increasing in contrast to carcinoma with origin in
other subsites. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as a significant
risk factor of the carcinogenesis of OPSCC. The HPV-related OPSCC patients tend
to be relatively young, less exposed to tobacco and alcohol, and have a
relatively high socioeconomic status and education level, which is distinct from 
HPV-unrelated classical OPSCC. The neck metastases tend to be aggressive and
cystic. The better response to treatment resulting in improved prognosis of
HPV-related OPSCC led to reconsidering the clinical staging and treatment
approaches. Clinical trials of treatment deintensification to reduce the acute
and late toxicity without compromising efficacy have been conducted. This review 
of HPV-related OPSCC focuses on current and generally accepted facts regarding
the biology, epidemiology, and therapeutic strategy of this new disease entity.
