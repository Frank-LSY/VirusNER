P16 overexpression was detected in 9 (11.5%) of 78 cases, but HPV E6/E7 mRNA transcripts were detected in only 1 (1.3%) case (positive predictive value of p16 staining for the presence of transcriptionally active HPV=0.12). HPV mRNA transcripts were not detected in any patient under 40 (n=11), or in patients who had never smoked (n=44), had quit smoking (n=15), and/or were only light consumers of alcohol (n=57).
