OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Propranolol has recently been introduced as a novel
pharmacologic treatment for infantile hemangiomas. Systematic examination of this
treatment in a tertiary care setting has not been described. This study explores 
the impact of propranolol on both proliferative and involuting hemangiomas at a
tertiary vascular anomalies center.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single institution review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed children treated with propranolol for
problematic hemangiomas followed by a blinded prospective analysis of serial
photographs taken during the course of their therapy. Parental questionnaires
were obtained to evaluate perceived therapeutic response and complications to
oral propranolol.
RESULTS: Thirty-two children with complete photo documentation were treated with 
oral propranolol for infantile hemangiomas between September 2008 and June 2009. 
Twenty-seven patients began therapy during the proliferative phase of their
lesions (mean age, 4.9 months), whereas five patients began during the
involutional phase (mean age, 19.4 months). Ninety-seven percent of patients
displayed improvement in the quality of their hemangiomas during propranolol
therapy. Patients were determined to be excellent responders (n = 16, 50%),
partial responders (n = 15, 47%), or nonresponders (n = 1, 3%). Partial and
nonresponders received adjuvant therapy (75%, laser therapy; 31%, steroid
injections). Ten patients experienced minor but reportable side effects to
propranolol, including somnolence (27.2%), gastroesophageal reflux (9.1%),
respiratory syncytial virus exacerbation (4.5%), and rash (4.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol may revolutionize the treatment of problematic
hemangiomas that cause imminent functional or cosmetic sequelae. At therapeutic
doses, propranolol is safe and effective in the majority of patients. Adjunctive 
therapies may still be required. Minor side effects, expected from beta-blocker
therapy, are common but easily managed.
