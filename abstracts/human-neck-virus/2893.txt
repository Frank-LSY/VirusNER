BACKGROUND: Although intraoral resection of small-sized tonsil cancer achieves
excellent tumor control, the extent of local invasion and adequate safety margin 
in resection have not been studied. Thus, we aim to determine the extent of local
invasion in terms of mucosal spread and deep infiltration in stage T1-2 tonsil
cancer.
METHODS: We re-analyzed the surgical specimens from 49 cT1-2 tonsil cancers.
Microscopic tumor cell extension from the tumor gross boundary of specimens was
assessed in representative sections of each tumor. We also tested whether local
extension correlates with human papilloma virus (HPV) status of tumors.
RESULTS: The extent of microscopic deep invasion from the gross tumor border was 
0.52 ± 0.41 mm, which was significantly less than that of mucosal spread
(0.83 ± 0.61 mm, P = 0.01) in cT1-2 tonsil cancer. The microscopic deep invasion 
correlated with tumor size (rho = 0.703, P < 0.001). We found tumor invasion into
superior constrictor muscles in 58.1%, no cases of tumor invasion into the deep
fascia. In terms of HPV status (genotyping plus p16 staining), there were no
differences in microscopic tumor extension.
CONCLUSION: Our detailed pathologic analyses confirm that an oropharyngectomy
including the superior constrictor muscle is an oncologically safe procedure for 
stage T1-2 tonsil cancer.
