OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review
patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) for the presence of retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RPLNs) prior
to treatment using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and
to determine if the presence of RPLNs is of utility in predicting outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient data from a single institution.
METHODS: Two hundred thirty patients with a diagnosis of HPV-associated OPSCC
were identified from 2002 to 2013. The presence of RPLNs was determined primarily
from findings on PET/CT as reviewed in a standardized fashion by two
neuroradiologists.
RESULTS: Of the 230 patients, 165 had pretreatment PET/CT imaging available for
review. There were a total of 16 patients (9.70%) with evidence of RPLNs. Among
patients positive for RPLNs pretreatment, with an average follow-up of 2 years,
there was a 5.2-times greater odds of having recurrence or death (31.3% vs. 8.1%,
P=.004). When T and N stage were adjusted for with multiple regression, there was
no significant association between RPLN status and recurrence free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique investigation utilizing PET/CT to classify RPLN
status in HPV-associated OPSCC. RPLNs were relatively common in our
HPV-associated OPSCC cohort at 9.70%, at the low end of the quoted positivity of 
10% to 27% in all OPSCC. A combination of PET/CT is useful in identifying RPLNs. 
Prospective investigation will be needed to determine the sensitivity and
specificity of PET/CT in identifying RPLNs, and the precise impact of RPLNs on
HPV-associated OPSCC treatment and outcomes.
