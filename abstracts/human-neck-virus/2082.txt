Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx
(OSCC) are clinical and biological distinct from their HPV-unrelated
counterparts. Patients with HPV-related OSCC display improved prognosis and
therefore we investigated possible immune cell infiltrations associated with this
tumor phenotype. We retrospectively analyzed a randomly selected cohort of 140
OSCC for presence of immune cells and HPV by immunohistochemistry and PCR
followed by bead-based hybridization (Luminex technology). HPV prevalence was
24.3% as determined by positive staining of p16INK4a and detection of high risk
HPV-DNA. We found significantly higher numbers of CD56 positive (CD56+) cells in 
tumor and surrounding microenvironment in HPV-associated compared to HPV-negative
OSCC (t-test: p = 0.004 and p = 0.002). For the entire cohort presence of CD56+
cells was associated with increased overall survival independent from HPV
(Kaplan-Meier: p = 0.002; Cox regression: p = 0.042). Presence of CD56+ cells
also correlated with a better outcome in HPV-negative and especially in
HPV-negative OSCC with alcohol consumption ≤ 2 standard drinks per day
(Kaplan-Meier: p = 0.05 and p = 0.003). Immunofluorescence localization of
granular Granzyme B (GZMB) within CD56+ cells and coexpression of CD16 and CD56
suggests that detected CD56+ cells mainly represent cytotoxic Natural Killer (NK)
cells. The fraction of potentially cytotoxic NK cells was significantly higher in
HPV-associated compared to HPV-negative OSCC (Mann-Whitney-U-Test: p = 0.011).
The elevated abundance and activity of cytotoxic NK cells in OSCC with HPV driven
carcinogenesis might contribute to favorable outcome in HPV-related OSCC.
