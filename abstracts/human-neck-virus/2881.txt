OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of miR-30b in hair cells of mice,and its
regulatory effect on the target gene DNM1 and expression of Dynamin,the key
protein of synaptic endocytosis in inner hair cells.
METHODS: The basilar membrane of cochlear in adult C57 mice was obtained. The
expression of miR-30b in the hair cells was detected by in situ hybridization.
Luciferase vector was constructed and transfected into 293T cells with miR-30b.
Changes in luciferase activity were measured to verify whether DNM1 was the
target gene of miR-30b. Adeno-associated virus carrying miR-30b were
micro-injected into cochlear via the round window membrane. mRNA expressions of
DNM1 and miR-30b were detected by RT-PCR 14 days later. The expression of Dynamin
was detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: miR-30b expressed in the inner and outer hair cells scattered in the
region of the nucleus and cytoplasm. miR-30b reduced luciferase activity from the
reporter vector containing DNM11 (P<0.05),but not in its mutants. Increased
expressions of miR-30b and decreased mRNA expressions of DNM1 and Dynamin were
observed following transfection of AAV-miR-30b.
CONCLUSION: miR-30b expresses in inner and outer hair cells,which is consistent
with the morphological orientation of dynamin. miR-30b inhibits the expression of
Dynamin by targeting DNM11 gene.
