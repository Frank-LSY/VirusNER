BACKGROUND: p16 has been indicated as a suitable surrogate biomarker of HPV
infection. The prognosis of p16-positive oropharynx tumors (OTs) of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) histology is better than that of p16-negative tumors.
METHODS: We analyzed 209 samples of head and neck SCC to establish a predictive
cutoff for p16 and determine the role of p16 positivity in OTs versus non-OTs. We
compared the outcomes of tumors harboring any percentage of p16-positive cells
(≥1%) with those of p16-negative OTs. We then considered 3 cutoffs (10%, 50% and 
70% positive cells) to evaluate the outcome of OTs/non-OTs with similar p16
expression and p16-positive versus p16-negative tumors stratified by patient age.
RESULTS: p16-negative tumors among OTs and non-OTs were 29% and 49%, respectively
(p = 0.0054). The cumulative distribution showed that the positive values were
located around 2 focus points: 2% and 96%. Subgroup analysis showed that only OTs
occurred in young patients (aged &lt;65 years) and that there was a ≥70% gain in 
survival in cases with p16-positive cells.
CONCLUSIONS: p16 positivity influences outcome only in young patients and OTs (p 
= 0.048).
