BACKGROUND: No study has combined tumour and clinical covariates for survival to 
construct an individual risk-profile for overall survival (OS), time to
progression (TTP), and survival after progression (SAP) in patients with HPV+ and
HPV- oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Based on the largest-to-date,
unselected, population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with OPSCC, we
performed a comprehensive analysis of long-term OS, TTP, and SAP and constructed 
novel nomograms to evaluate patients' prognoses.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range: 0.8-15.8 yrs.), 690 deaths
were recorded. The 5-year OS, TTP, and SAP for the HPV+/p16+ subgroup were 77%,
82%, and 33, vs. 30%, 66%, and 6% for the HPV-/p16- group (P < 0.01). 376
patients failed to maintain disease control with a median TTP of 13 months in the
HPV+/p16+ subgroup vs. 8.5 months in the HPV-/p16- subgroup (P < 0.05). HPV
combined with p16 status remained one of the most informative covariates in the
final Cox regression model for OS, TTP, and SAP.
METHODS: We included all patients diagnosed with OPSCC (n = 1,542) between
2000-2014 in Eastern Denmark. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to construct predictive,
internally validated nomograms.
CONCLUSION: The HPV+/p16+ subgroup had improved OS, TTP, and SAP compared with
other combinations of HPV and p16 after adjusting for covariates. Nomograms were 
constructed for 1-, 5- and 10-year survival probability. Models may aid patients 
and clinicians in their clinical decision making as well as in counselling,
research, and trial design.
