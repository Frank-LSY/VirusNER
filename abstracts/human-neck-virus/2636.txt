TGF-β1rs1982073 polymorphism at the miRNA-187 binding site may alter TGF-β1
expression and function, and thereby this polymorphism (genotype CT/CC) increases
cancer susceptibility. HPV16 L1 seropositivity is associated with the risk of
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), including oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). Thus, we
hypothesized that TGF-β1rs1982073 polymorphism at the miRNA-187 binding site
combined with HPV16 L1 seropositivity may have a joint effect on OSCC
susceptibility. We determined the genotypes of TGF-β1rs1982073 and HPV16 status
in 325 OSCC subjects and 335 cancer-free controls in the non-Hispanic white
population, and used logistic regression models to evaluate the joint effects on 
OSCC susceptibility. TGF-β1rs1982073 polymorphism (CT/CC genotype) combined with 
HPV16 L1 seropositivity increased the risk of OSCC via joint effects,
particularly in OPSCC subjects who were never-smokers (OR, 165.9; 95% CI,
28.6-960.4) or never-drinkers (OR, 196.0; 95% CI, 28.2-1,000.0), respectively.
Younger subjects had a higher risk of OPSCC than older subjects (OR, 23.5; 95%
CI, 6.3-87.0 vs. OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.7-17.9, respectively). The significant
associations between this polymorphism and HPV16-associated OSCC and OPSCC were
also observed. However, OCSCC subjects did not have similar results. Our findings
suggest that the joint effects of TGF-β1rs1982073 and HPV16 L1 seropositivity can
increase risk of HPV16-associated oral cancer, particularly in OPSCC subjects who
are never-smokers, never-drinkers and young. This result may help us understand
the tumorigenesis process and improve early detection, which are critical for
prevention and intervention strategies. However, larger studies are needed to
validate our findings.
