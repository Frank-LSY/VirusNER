BACKGROUND: The trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV), a
recently discovered species of the family Polyomaviridae, is associated with
development of trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), a rare follicular skin disease of 
immunocompromised individuals. The viral seroprevalence in the general population
is ∼70%, with little known of its route of transmission, latency, or primary
infection site.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether the viral DNA is detectable in
tonsillar tissue of constitutionally healthy individuals, and what the
corresponding antiviral seroreactivities are.
STUDY DESIGN: We tested 229 matched pairs of tonsillar tissue biopsies and serum 
samples from asymptomatic donors for TSPyV DNA by real-time quantitative PCR with
primer pairs and Taq-Man probes targeting the VP1 and LT genes. The sera were
studied by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for TSPyV-VP1-IgG and the PCR-positive
individuals also for -IgM and -IgG-avidity.
RESULTS: TSPyV DNA was detectable in 8 (3.5%) of 229 tonsillar tissues, and in
none of the corresponding sera. TSPyV IgG seroprevalence among children was 39%
and among adults 70%. Each of the 8 PCR-positive subjects had antiviral IgG of
high avidity but not IgM.
CONCLUSIONS: TSPyV PCR positivity of tonsillar samples of individuals with
long-term immunity provides the first evidence of TSPyV in tonsils and suggests
lymphoid tissue as a latency site of this emerging human pathogen.
