BD was diagnosed more often in potentially sun-exposed sites with prevalence 73.6 % and a remarkable predilection for the head and neck region. High risk α-HPV or β-HPV were detected in 34.7 % of lesions and β-HPV infections dominated over α-HPV. Higher prevalence of koilocyte-like changes and papillomatosis was found in HPV-positive specimens but it was not statistically significant. The expression of p16 was detected in 79.8 % of lesions and displayed no correlation with the HPV status. HPV-positivity tended to be detected more often in sun-protected sites. Dual infections by α-HPV/β-HPV genera and mixed α-HPV infections were not detected, while 37.5 % of β-HPV positive specimens were infected by two or more β-HPV genotypes. HPV 9 was significantly associated with mixed β-HPV infections.
