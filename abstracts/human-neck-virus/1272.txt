OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine disparities in survival outcome and clinical
presentation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients with human
papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical research.
METHODS: Clinical data on Hispanics and non-Hispanic white patients with
diagnosis of human papillomavirus/p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma were drawn from a tumor registry from the University of Miami Hospitals
and Clinics from 2008 to 2014. Of 436 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma, 237 patents met inclusion criteria. Patient's age, gender, smoking
history, alcohol history, race/ethnicity, tumor T stage, nodal N stage, and
composite TNM stage were included in the analysis. Associations between race and 
other categorical variables were explored with χ2 test or Fisher exact test where
appropriate. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Significant differences in clinical presentation was detected between
Hispanic (N = 70) and non-Hispanic white (N = 167) patients. Hispanic human
papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients showed a
higher proportion of women with disease, a higher proportion of patients
presenting with tonsil rather than tongue base primary subsite cancer, and a
higher proportion of patients who do not consume alcohol compared to non-Hispanic
white human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
patients. A statistically significant survival difference between these two
ethnic groups was not detected in the current dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Unique differences in clinical presentations between Hispanic
patients and non-Hispanic whites with human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma were detected. This may be the first study to report
novel clinical presentation in Hispanic human papillomavirus-positive patients
with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma living in the United States.
