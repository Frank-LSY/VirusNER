AIMS: Human papillomavirus is well established in oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma as both causative and prognostic, but its significance in
non-oropharyngeal tumours is unclear. In particular, the significance of finding 
viral DNA is not known. We sought to evaluate nonoropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas for transcriptionally-active human papillomavirus and to compare this 
with the presence of viral DNA.
METHODS: We evaluated an 87 patient tissue microarray cohort of oral cavity and
laryngeal/hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas for high risk human
papillomavirus DNA and E6 and E7 mRNA transcripts by in situ hybridization, and
for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found only two of the 73 (2.7%) evaluable cases to harbour
transcriptionally-active human papillomavirus. Both of these tumours were from
the larynx, one was positive for human papillomavirus DNA by in situ
hybridization, and both were extensively positive for p16. All oral cavity and
hypopharyngeal tumours were negative for human papillomavirus.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptionally-active human papillomavirus appears to be rare in 
laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas. As such, it 
appears unlikely to be a 'driver' or to be clinically significant in most
established tumours.
