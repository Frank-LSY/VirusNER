Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is most frequently a self-limiting benign viral skin
disease. Transmitted by direct skin contact, it is characterized by
flesh-colored, dome-shaped, umbilicated lesions. Diagnosis of MC is often done
clinically, but when needed, biopsy can be performed, in which characteristic
Henderson-Patterson bodies, representing intracytoplasmic assemblies of the
virus, are pathognomonic. Atypical presentations of MC are rare in
immunocompetent individuals and are challenging to diagnose. We report a case of 
giant MC, presenting as an ulcero-proliferative growth, in neck of an 8-month-old
female child. Fine-needle aspiration cytology smears revealed characteristic
intracytoplasmic molluscum bodies. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by
histopathology. In this case, cytological examination helped in reaching the
correct diagnosis, in a clinically unsuspected case.
