BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular anomalies encompass different vascular malformations
[arteriovenous (AVM), lymphatic (LM), venous lymphatic (VLM), venous (VM)] and
vascular tumors such as hemangiomas (HA). The pathogenesis of vascular anomalies 
is still poorly understood. Viral infection was speculated as a possible
underlying cause.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13 human vascular anomalies and three human
skin control tissues were used for viral analysis. RNA derived from AVM (n=4) and
normal skin control (n=3) tissues was evaluated by RNA sequencing. The Virome
Capture Sequencing Platform for Vertebrate Viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) was deployed 
on 10 tissues with vascular anomalies (2×AVM, 1×HA, 1×LM, 2×VLM, 4×VM).
RESULTS: RNA sequencing did not show any correlation of AVM with viral infection.
By deploying VirCapSeq-VERT, no consistent viral association was seen in the
tested tissues.
CONCLUSION: The analysis does not point to the presence of an active viral
infection in vascular anomalies. However, transient earlier viral infections,
e.g. during pregnancy, cannot be excluded with this approach.
