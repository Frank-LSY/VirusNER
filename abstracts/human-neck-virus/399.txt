Two hundred thirty-five women were included in the study. Of the 235 women, 135 (57.5%) were cervically HR-HPV positive with histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesion (median [range] age = 30 [21-45] years). Of these, only 6 (4.4%) also had a positive oral specimen. In 3 (50%) of the 6 cases, the same HPV type was detected in oral and cervical samples (HPV 16, 35, and 45). Oral HPV detection was not higher when combining swab and lavage compared with swab alone. A relation between sexual behavior and oral HPV detection could not be demonstrated.
