An increasing proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection. Several authors have suggested that HR-HPV DNA could be used as a marker of metastases in cervical cancers. Although HPV16 DNA has been detected in neck lymph node (LN) metastases of HPV16-positive OPSCC, its significance remains controversial. Does this presence correlate to metastatic involvement or is it just the consequence of LN filter function?
