OBJECTIVE: To map comprehensively the methylation status of the CpG sites within 
the HPV16 long control region (LCR) in HPV-positive cancer cells, and to explore 
further the effects of methylation status of HPV16 LCR on cell bioactivity and E6
and E7 expression. In addition, to analyze the methylation status of the LCR in
HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Methylation patterns of HPV16 LCR in UM-SCC47, CaSki, and 
SiHa cells and HPV16-positiive OPSCC specimens were detected by
bisulfite-sequencing PCR and TA cloning. For cells treated with
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and E6 and E7 knockdown, MTS and trypan blue staining,
annexin-V and 7-AAD staining, and prodidium iodide were used to evaluate cell
growth and cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest,
respectively. E6 and E7 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by quantitative
real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively.
RESULTS: Hypermethylation status of the LCR in UM-SCC47 (79.8%) and CaSki cells
(90.0%) and unmethylation status of the LCR in SiHa cells (0%) were observed.
Upon demethylation, the cells with different methylation levels responded
differently during growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, as well as in terms 
of their E6 and E7 expression. In HPV16-positive OPSCC patients, the methylation 
rates were 9.5% in the entire LCR region, 13.9% in the 5'-LCR, 6.0% in the E6
enhancer, and 9.5% in the p97 promoter, and hypermethylation of p97 promoter was 
found in a subset of cases (20.0%, 2/10).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed two different methylation levels of the LCR in
HPV16-positive cancer cells and OPSCC patients, which may represent different
carcinogenesis mechanisms of HPV-positive cancers cells. Demethylating the meCpGs
in HPV16 LCR might be a potential target for a subgroup of HPV16-positive
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
