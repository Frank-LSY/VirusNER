OBJECTIVES: Functional inactivation of p16 is an early and frequent event in the 
carcinogenesis of tumours of the head and neck region. However, the prognostic
relevance of p16 protein expression for these tumours has been controversial.
This study aims to examine immunohistochemical expression of p16 and HP virus in 
a large number of oral carcinomas, and possible correlation with clinical
features of the tumours and survival of the patients.
METHODS: Two tissue microarrays composed of 222 oral carcinomas and 427 squamous 
cell carcinomas of the head and neck region were used for this study. Sections
were stained immunohistochemically (anti-p16), and PCR analysis (HPV status) was 
carried out. Correlation of p16 expression/HPV status with features of tumours
and with survival of the patients was analysed by means of Chi-squared test and
using Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: p16 expression was found immunohistochemically in 74% of tumours, but
was not significantly correlated with features of the tumours, but
recurrence-free survival of the patients (P = 0.009) if located predominantly
nuclear. On the other hand neither intensity of p16 expression (P = 0.41) nor HPV
status (P = 0.82) had any effect on these two aspects.
CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical expression of p16 alone provides a limited tool
for diagnosis and prognosis of carcinomas of the head and neck region.
Immunohistochemical analysis of p16 depending on its intracellular location might
serve as a surrogate marker for HPV infection.
