BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) secondary to human papillomavirus (HPV)
infections likely represent a completely different disease compared with
conventional head and neck cancers. Our objective was to analyze a surgically
treated cohort to determine predictors of outcome in HPV-positive versus
HPV-negative patients.
METHODS: HPV positivity was inferred based on p16-immunohistochemistry. Data was 
available for 201 patients with OPC treated with surgical resection with/without 
adjuvant radiotherapy between 1985 and 2005. Subsite distribution was: 66 (33 %) 
tonsil, 46 (23 %) soft palate, and 89 (44 %) tongue base. Patients were
classified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on p16 status and
smoking history. Outcomes stratified by p16 status and risk groups were
determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors predictive of outcome were
determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: In this cohort, 30 % had locally advanced disease (pT3/T4) and 71 % had 
nodal metastasis. The 5-year overall (OS), disease-specific, and recurrence-free 
survival rates were 60, 76, and 66 %, respectively. There were 22 % low-, 34 %
intermediate-, and 44 % high-risk patients. Patients who were p16-positive had
better survival compared with p16-negative (OS, 74 vs. 44 %; p < .001).
Similarly, low-risk group patients had a better survival compared with
intermediate- and high-risk groups (OS, 76, 68, 45 %, respectively, p < .001).
Independent predictors of survival in p16-negative patients included margin
status, lymphovascular invasion, pN status, and extracapsular spread. In
contrast, none of these were predictive in p16-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgically treated patients with p16-positive OPC have superior
survival compared with p16-negative patients. Outcomes in p16-positive and
p16-negative OPC are determined by different prognostic factors supporting the
notion that these are very different diseases. These should be incorporated into 
future clinical trials design.
