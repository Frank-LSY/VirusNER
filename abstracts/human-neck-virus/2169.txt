BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator 1 (STAT-1) mutations are rare and
have been implicated in combined immunodeficiency, enhanced tumorigenesis, and
vascular defects.
METHODS: A 60-year-old woman with a novel STAT-1 mutation and resulting
immunodeficiency, squamous cell carcinoma, and vascular disease presented with
profuse epistaxis secondary to rupture of an aberrant artery that she developed
in part because of this mutation. After unsuccessful posterior packing,
embolization was initiated but subsequently aborted because of a bovine origin
carotid artery and a history of multiple carotid dissections.
RESULTS: After repeat posterior packing, hemostasis was achieved. No additional
episodes of epistaxis occurred in the subsequent 13 months.
CONCLUSION: Vascular anomalies can present challenges in epistaxis management. In
patients with conditions known to cause vascular anomalies, it is critical to
obtain vascular imaging before intervention.
