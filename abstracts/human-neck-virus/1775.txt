OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has an important role in the aetiology of a
range of diseases, including cervical, other anogenital, and head and neck
cancers, genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. This literature 
review was conducted to identify the available cost data for non-cervical
HPV-related cancers (anal, penile, vulvar, vaginal, head and neck) in Europe and 
to inform discussion of methodological challenges for future economic research.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted using Medline and key words to
identify papers published in English or French between 1 January 2000 and 31
December 2011. Abstracts of major conferences were searched to identify relevant 
information. Structured methods were used to select references that focused on
overall disease management for inclusion in the review.
RESULTS: A total of 21 references from seven countries (Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, The Netherlands, Portugal, and the UK) were selected, including 11
references relating to head and neck cancers, five to anogenital cancers, and
five to more than one HPV-related disease. Non-cervical cancers accounted for a
substantial proportion of the economic burden of HPV-related cancers, and this
burden was mainly driven by men (∼70%). A wide range of costs were reported for
each disease, particularly head and neck cancers, predominantly due to disease
complexity and variation in study design.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study was in the search strategy, which 
was constrained by the key words, the database searched, and the restriction on
language (English/French).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-cervical cancers attributable to HPV impose a substantial
economic burden in Europe, and the burden is greater in men than in women. This
review provides useful information for future health-economic studies assessing
the impact of HPV vaccination on all HPV-related diseases.
