OBJECTIVE: To illuminate the pathophysiology of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) with
sequential monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers during an ARS episode and to
clarify their diagnostic usability in bacterial ARS.
STUDY DESIGN: Inception cohort study with 50 conscripts with ARS.
METHODS: We collected peripheral blood high-sensitive C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP), white blood cell (WBC), procalcitonin, and nasal nitric oxide (nNO)
counts at 2 to 3 and 9 to 10 days of symptoms during an ARS episode. We
simultaneously gathered various clinical parameters and microbiological samples. 
Bacterial ARS was confirmed with a positive culture of sinus aspirate.
RESULTS: Reciprocal correlations and a significant change in biomarker levels
between the two visits suggest that ARS involves a local and systemic
inflammatory response that was strongest at 2 to 3 days. High-sensitive CRP and
nNO reflected responses best (52% had increased CRP levels at 2-3 days; 66% had
decreased nNO levels). White blood cell and procalcitonin counts rarely exceeded 
the reference range. Increased local and systemic inflammatory response were
linked to multiple, adenoviral, or influenza A viral etiology or the detection of
bacterial ARS. Local response correlated with imaging findings of wide paranasal 
sinus involvement and ostiomeatal complex occlusion. At 9 to 10 days, elevated (≥
11 mg/L) and moderately elevated (≥ 49 mg/L) hs-CRP predicted bacterial ARS well 
(likelihood ratio [LR]+ 3.3 and LR+ 15.8, respectively), but the sensitivity for 
both findings remained low.
CONCLUSION: Acute rhinosinusitis (particularly bacterial ARS) involves a local
and systemic inflammatory response that is strongest at the beginning of
symptoms. Elevated hs-CRP supports the diagnosis of bacterial ARS.
