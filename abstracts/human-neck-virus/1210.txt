OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes and toxicity of high-dose cisplatin (HDC)
versus weekly cisplatin (WC) definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with
human papillomavirus (HPV) related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(SCCOPx).
METHODS: All patients with p16 positive SCCOPx treated with definitive CRT with
cisplatin between 2010 and 2014 at a single institution were retrospectively
reviewed. CTCAE v 4.03 toxicity criteria were used. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate event-free survival (EFS) and the overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Of the 55 patients included, 22 were patients treated with HDC at dose
of 100mg/m2 on days 1 and 22; and the remaining 33 patients were treated with WC 
at 40mg/m2. Both cohorts received a median total dose of cisplatin of 200mg/m2.
At median follow-up of 31months, there was one local failure and no distant
failures in the HDC cohort. In the WC group, there were 6 total failures (2
local, 4 distant). Estimated 2-year EFS was better in HDC cohort as compared to
WC (96% vs. 75%; p=0.04). There was no significant difference in 2-year OS (95%
vs. 94%; p=0.40). Weight loss, gastric tube dependence at six months, acute renal
injury and grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity were all similar between both
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV-related SCCOPx treated with definitive CRT with either HDC or WC
had similar toxicity profile. HDC had better EFS when compared with WC and this
seems to be driven by increased distant failure rates, although the OS was
similar.
