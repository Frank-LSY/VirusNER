BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted
infection in the world. It can lead to anogenital, cervical, and head and neck
cancer, with higher risk of malignant disease in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. 
In India, 73,000 of the 130,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer die
annually. Gardasil(®) , a vaccine available against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, 
is approved for use in women in India but not men. A backlash to post-licensure
trials has created a negative public opinion of the vaccine for women.
Vaccinating boys and men is an alternate approach to prevent cervical cancer in
women. This study gauges facilitators and barriers to vaccination acceptance
among men in Bangalore, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young men presenting to a dermatology clinic or an ART
center in Bangalore, India, answered a seven-point survey assessing acceptance of
the HPV vaccine, perceived barriers to vaccination, and acceptance of vaccination
for their children. Ninety-three general dermatology patients and 85 patients
with HIV/AIDS participated.
RESULTS: There was a high degree of vaccine acceptance for both groups, 83 and
98%, respectively. Vaccine side effects and cost were cited as key barriers to
vaccination, and doctor recommendation and government approval were the main
facilitators.
CONCLUSION: There is potential for high acceptability of the HPV vaccine among
men in India. These results can facilitate further study of vaccine acceptance
among males and physician opinion and knowledge about HPV vaccine use.
Vaccination of males is a hopeful strategy to protect men and women from
HPV-related malignancies.
