OBJECTIVE: To determine if prodrug conversion of fluorocytosine to fluorouracil
by an engineered herpes virus, OncoVEX(GALV/CD), enhances oncolytic therapy of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
DESIGN: We assessed the ability of OncoVEX(GALV/CD) and OncoVEX(GFP) to infect,
replicate within, and lyse 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines in
vitro. The effects of adding fluorocytosine with OncoVEX(GALV/CD) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was permissive to green
fluorescent protein expression in100% of cells by OncoVEX(GFP) at a multiplicity 
of infection of 1 after 48 hours and supported logarithmic viral replication.
Virus caused more than 60% cell death 6 days after exposure to virus at a
multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in 3 of the 4 cell lines. Fluorocytosine did not
enhance cytotoxicity induced by OncoVEX(GALV/CD) at a multiplicity of infection
of 0.1. However, for the least-sensitive SCC25 cell line, virus at a multiplicity
of infection of 0.01 was cytotoxic to only 4% of cells after 6 days but was
cytotoxic to 35% of cells with fluorocytosine.
CONCLUSIONS: OncoVEX(GALV/CD) efficiently infects, replicates within, and lyses
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma at relatively low viral doses. Prodrug
conversion by cytosine deaminase did not enhance therapy at viral doses that
cause efficient cytotoxicity but may have beneficial effects in less-sensitive
cell lines at low viral doses.
