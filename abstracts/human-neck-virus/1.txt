The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in anogenital tract and head
and neck cancers is well established. However, only a low percentage of
HPV-positive women develop cancer, indicating that HPV is necessary but not
sufficient in carcinogenesis. Several biological and environmental cofactors have
been implicated in the development of HPV-associated carcinoma that include
immune status, hormonal changes, parity, dietary habits, tobacco usage, and
co-infection with other sexually transmissible agents. Such cofactors likely
contribute to HPV persistent infection through diverse mechanisms related to
immune control, efficiency of HPV infection, and influences on tumor initiation
and progression. Conversely, HPV co-infection with other factors may also harbor 
anti-tumor effects. Here, we review epidemiological and experimental studies
investigating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1
and 2, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BK virus (BKV), JC
virus (JCV), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) as viral cofactors in or
therapeutic factors against the development of genital and oral HPV-associated
carcinomas.
