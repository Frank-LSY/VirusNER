The tumor suppressor P12CDK2AP1 negatively regulates cyclin-dependent kinase 2
(CDK2) activities and suppresses DNA replication. Notably, P12CDK2AP1 is known to
be downregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Silencing of
specific gene expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) using expression vectors and retroviruses has become a powerful tool for
the genetic analysis of mammalian cells. In the present study, we utilized
lentivirus‑mediated shRNA for functional gene knockdown in normal human skin
keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells in order to assess the potential role of P12CDK2AP1
in HNSCCs. Lentivirus‑mediated RNA interference (RNAi) effectively reduced
endogenous P12CDK2AP1 expression in HaCaT cells and significantly promoted HaCaT 
cell proliferation in vitro. Lentiviral vectors have the ability to infect
dividing and non-dividing cells as well as to achieve long‑term multilineage gene
expression. Thus, additional studies are needed to investigate the use of such
vectors as a therapeutic tool for the delivery of siRNAs.
