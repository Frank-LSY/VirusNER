Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA analysis has been shown to be useful for early
detection, prognostication, and monitoring of treatment response of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and the recent literature provides growing
evidence of the clinical utility of EBV DNA testing, particularly to inform
treatment decisions for NPC patients. Despite the fact that NPC is a rare
disease, the NRG Oncology cooperativeÂ group has successfully activated a phase
2/3 randomized clinical trial for NPC with international partners and in that
process has discovered that the development of a harmonized EBV DNA test is
absolutely critical for integration into clinical trials and for future
deployment in clinical and central laboratories. In November 2015, the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) convened a workshop of international experts in the
treatment of NPC and EBV testing to provide a forum for discussing the state of
EBV DNA testing and its clinical utility, and to stimulate consideration of
future studies and clinical practice guidelines for EBV DNA. This review provides
a summary of that discussion.
