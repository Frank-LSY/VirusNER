BACKGROUND: Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of the head and neck is a rare
malignancy characterized by loco-regional and distant aggressiveness. At
histology, ASC reveals two distinct, juxtaposed components, squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), and true adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of AE3, CK19 and CAM5.2, and HPV
infection was tested in a case of laryngeal ASC.
RESULTS: The patient had no regional lymph node metastases, but developed a
recurrence in neck soft tissues shortly after primary radical surgery. The
laryngeal surgical specimen had the typical morphological features of ASC. The
tumor's squamous and glandular components were both strongly and diffusely
immunoreactive for AE3 and CK19, whereas CAM5.2 selectively stained only the
gland-like part. We found no high- or low-risk HPV DNA (28 genotypes) in the
specimens. The patient underwent salvage extended radical neck dissection and
received postoperative radio-chemotherapy. At 4-month follow-up control, neck
recurrence was found. Palliative chemotherapy was instituted.
CONCLUSIONS: An accurate histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis is
mandatory to differentiate ASC from conventional SCC. Radical surgical excision
is recommended for laryngeal ASC. Adjuvant postoperative therapy is administered 
in most cases, but there are no widely accepted indications for these treatments.
