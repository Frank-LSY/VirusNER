A phase 2 trial of surgery with perioperative INGN 201 (Ad5CMV-p53) gene therapy 
followed by chemoradiotherapy for advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of treating patients with high-risk stage
III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
and larynx with perioperative adenovirus-p53 (INGN 201) gene therapy along with
surgery and chemoradiotherapy.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A phase 2 study in a multi-institutional setting within the
Southwest Oncology Group.
PATIENTS: Thirteen individuals who met the following entry criteria: newly
diagnosed, previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity,
oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx; selected stage III or IV disease without
distant metastases; and surgically resectable disease.
INTERVENTIONS: Surgery, perioperative INGN 201 gene therapy, and postoperative
chemoradiotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall patient status, tumor status, adverse effects,
accrual rate, and percentage of patients successfully receiving the required
doses of INGN 201.
RESULTS: All 13 patients received surgery and perioperative INGN 201 injections
in the primary tumor bed and the ipsilateral neck. In addition, 3 patients
received injections in the contralateral neck. Three patients did not receive
chemoradiotherapy. One patient had a grade 2 fistula of the oral cavity. Of the
10 patients with evaluable data, 2 experienced grade 4 adverse events, 1 owing to
hypokalemia, hyponatremia, vomiting, leukopenia, and neutropenia and 1 owing to
increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Seven
other patients experienced grade 3 adverse events. The estimate of 1-year
progression-free survival is 92%.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated the feasibility of handling and delivering a
very complex gene vector safely in multiple cooperative group institutions
without significant incident. Intraoperative INGN 201 gene therapy is technically
feasible, but it has many logistical problems when performed in a
multi-institutional setting. Regulatory requirements might have hindered accrual 
in this multi-institutional setting. Disease control seems to be promising;
however, no definitive conclusion can be made with this small sample size.
