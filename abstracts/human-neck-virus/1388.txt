BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) oropharyngeal cancer is a rapidly
emerging disease with generally good prognosis. Many prognostic algorithms for
oropharyngeal cancer incorporate HPV status as a stratification factor, rather
than recognising the uniqueness of HPV+ disease. The International Collaboration 
on Oropharyngeal cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S) aimed to develop a TNM
classification specific to HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.
METHODS: The ICON-S study included patients with non-metastatic oropharyngeal
cancer from seven cancer centres located across Europe and North America; one
centre comprised the training cohort and six formed the validation cohorts. We
ascertained patients' HPV status with p16 staining or in-situ hybridisation. We
compared overall survival at 5 years between training and validation cohorts
according to 7th edition TNM classifications and HPV status. We used recursive
partitioning analysis (RPA) and adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) modelling methods to 
derive new staging classifications for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer. Recent
hypotheses concerning the effect of lower neck lymph nodes and number of lymph
nodes were also investigated in an exploratory training cohort to assess
relevance within the ICON-S classification.
FINDINGS: Of 1907 patients with HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer, 661 (35%) were
recruited at the training centre and 1246 (65%) were enrolled at the validation
centres. 5-year overall survival was similar for 7th edition TNM stage I, II,
III, and IVA (respectively; 88% [95% CI 74-100]; 82% [71-95]; 84% [79-89]; and
81% [79-83]; global p=0·25) but was lower for stage IVB (60% [53-68]; p<0·0001). 
5-year overall survival did not differ among N0 (80% [95% CI 73-87]), N1-N2a (87%
[83-90]), and N2b (83% [80-86]) subsets, but was significantly lower for those
with N3 disease (59% [51-69]; p<0·0001). Stage classifications derived by RPA and
AHR models were ranked according to survival performance, and AHR-New was ranked 
first, followed by AHR-Orig, RPA, and 7th edition TNM. AHR-New was selected as
the proposed ICON-S stage classification. Because 5-year overall survival was
similar for patients classed as T4a and T4b, T4 is no longer subdivided in the
re-termed ICON-S T categories. Since 5-year overall survival was similar among
N1, N2a, and N2b, we re-termed the 7th edition N categories as follows: ICON-S
N0, no lymph nodes; ICON-S N1, ipsilateral lymph nodes; ICON-S N2, bilateral or
contralateral lymph nodes; and ICON-S N3, lymph nodes larger than 6 cm. This
resembles the N classification of nasopharyngeal carcinoma but without a lower
neck lymph node variable. The proposed ICON-S classification is stage I
(T1-T2N0-N1), stage II (T1-T2N2 or T3N0-N2), and stage III (T4 or N3). Metastatic
disease (M1) is classified as ICON-S stage IV. In an exploratory training cohort 
(n=702), lower lymph node neck involvement had a significant effect on survival
in ICON-S stage III but had no effect in ICON-S stage I and II and was not
significant as an independent factor. Overall survival was similar for patients
with fewer than five lymph nodes and those with five or more lymph nodes, within 
all ICON-S stages.
INTERPRETATION: Our proposed ICON-S staging system for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer 
is suitable for the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer
Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification. Future work is
needed to ascertain whether T and N categories should be further refined and
whether non-anatomical factors might augment the full classification.
