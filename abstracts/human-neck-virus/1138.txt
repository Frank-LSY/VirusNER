A 32-year-old married Asian woman, previously fit and well, presented with a
3-day history of interscapular back pain followed by a 1-day history of frontal
headache and a few episodes of vomiting. She did not have photophobia or neck
stiffness. On examination, there was evidence of herpes zoster infection
involving the right T3 dermatome. There were no signs of meningeal irritation,
cognitive impairment or any neurological deficit. As it is uncommon to have
reactivation of herpes zoster infection at a young age, HIV serology was
requested to exclude immunodeficiency state. While awaiting serology, a lumbar
puncture was performed to exclude opportunistic infections of the central nervous
system as she had transient headache and vomiting at the onset. The cerebrospinal
fluid showed an elevated level of protein, an increase in lymphocytes and a
strongly positive PCR for varicella zoster. The HIV test was negative. Oral
acyclovir was changed to intravenous therapy and, a week later, she was
discharged with uneventful recovery.
