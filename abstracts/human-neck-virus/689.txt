Safety, efficacy and enhanced transgene expression are the primary concerns while
using any vector for gene therapy. One of the widely used vectors in clinical
trials is adenovirus which provides a safe way to deliver the therapeutic gene.
However, adenovirus has poor transduction efficiency in vivo since most tumor
cells express low coxsackie and adenovirus receptors. Similarly transgene
expression remains low, possibly because of the chromatization of adenoviral
genome upon infection in eukaryotic cells, an effect mediated by histone
deacetylases (HDACs). Using a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-HSVtk) carrying the
herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSVtk) and GFP genes we demonstrate that HDAC
inhibitor valproic acid can bring about an increase in CAR expression on host
cells and thereby enhanced Ad-HSVtk infectivity. It also resulted in an increase 
in transgene (HSVtk and GFP) expression. This, in turn, resulted in increased
cell kill of HNSCC cells, following ganciclovir treatment in vitro as well as in 
vivo in a xenograft nude mouse model.
