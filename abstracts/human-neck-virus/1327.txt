BACKGROUND: This was a retrospective study of patients with human papillomavirus 
(HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer treated with concurrent systemic therapy
and radiation.
METHODS: Data were extracted through chart review, and statistical analyses
included frequency tabulation, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier tests.
RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed; 166 received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One hundred thirty-six patients were treated with
cisplatin, 123 with cetuximab, and 59 with carboplatin. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year
actuarial overall survival rates were 92%, 88%, and 78%, respectively. There were
no significant differences in survival or disease control when analyzed by
systemic agent. Platin-treated patients had greater hematologic toxicity, and
required more intravenous hydration. The incidence of confluent mucositis was
highest among patients treated with cetuximab.
CONCLUSION: Platin and cetuximab seem to have similar efficacy when delivered
concurrently with radiation in our retrospective population study. Although
platin did cause greater hematologic toxicity, radiation-specific side effects
seemed relatively comparable. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:
