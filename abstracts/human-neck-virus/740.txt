An HPV16-positive hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (UD-SCC-2) was infected with wt-HSV-1 at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and irradiated with 2 Gy at 24 h postinfection. Viability assays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR for HPV16 E6, E7, nuclear factor kappa B1, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and caspases 3, 8 and 9 at 24, and 72 h, as well as immunocytochemistry for BCL2, caspase 3, cyclin E, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), HSV-1 and Ki-67 were performed at 144 h postirradiation.
