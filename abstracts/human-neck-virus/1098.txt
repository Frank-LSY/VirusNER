BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine prospectively both human
papillomavirus (HPV) load and physical status in different types of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: HPV DNA, E6/E7 mRNA expression, viral load, and physical status of 184
patients with HNSCC were examined simultaneously by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based methods.
RESULTS: The HPV genome was detected in 54 HNSCC samples (29.3%), particularly in
tonsillar carcinomas (69.6%). Compared with nonoropharyngeal HNSCC, oropharyngeal
carcinoma harbored a relatively higher viral load, especially in tonsillar
carcinoma. Although integrated or mixed status was observed in 75.6% of
HPV-16-positive samples, E6/E7 mRNA transcripts were detected in only 27.5% of
HPV DNA-positive cases. High HPV-16 load correlated significantly with E6/E7 mRNA
expression.
CONCLUSION: E6/E7 mRNA expression in patients with HNSCC with low viral load
remains low even in cases of integration to the host genome. Tonsillar carcinomas
were significantly associated with HPV among various types of HNSCC.
