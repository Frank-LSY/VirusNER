BACKGROUND: The goal of the current study was to assess the rates of recurrence
in the neck for patients with lymph node-positive human papillomavirus-associated
cancer of the oropharynx who were treated with definitive radiotherapy (with or
without chemotherapy).
METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective study. Methodology included
database search, and statistical testing including frequency analysis,
Kaplan-Meier tests, and comparative tests including chi-square, logistic
regression, and log-rank.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 401 patients with lymph node-positive disease
who underwent radiotherapy between January 2006 and June 2012. A total of 388
patients had computed tomography restaging, and 251 had positron emission
tomography and/or ultrasound as a component of their postradiation staging.
Eighty patients (20%) underwent neck dissection, and 21 patients (26%) had a
positive specimen. The rate of neck dissection increased with increasing lymph
node stage, and was lower in patients who had positron emission tomography scans 
or ultrasound in addition to computed tomography restaging. The median follow-up 
was 30 months. The 2-year actuarial neck recurrence rate was 7% and 5%,
respectively, in all patients and those with local control. Lymph node recurrence
rates were greater in current smokers (P = .008). There was no difference in
lymph node recurrence rates noted between patients who did and those who did not 
undergo a neck dissection (P = .4) CONCLUSIONS: A treatment strategy of
(chemo)radiation with neck dissection performed based on response resulted in
high rates of regional disease control in patients with human
papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer.
