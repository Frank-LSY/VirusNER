There are currently three different types of human papillomavirus vaccinations and range in cover from four to nine different strains known to cause human disease. Most countries currently only supply vaccination to females; however, recent data point towards both a personal benefit as well as a cost-effective population-based benefit with gender-neutral vaccination. Data from female vaccination only have shown the vaccine to be effective in preventing premalignant cervical lesions, and are believed to have the same effect for other human papillomavirus cancers. Male vaccination not only provides personal benefit but also has a "herd effect" for females by preventing the propagation of the virus.
