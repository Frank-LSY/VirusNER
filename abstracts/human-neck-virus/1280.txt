SNORD44 is a C/D box small nucleolar RNA, and exhibits low expression in breast
cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Its host gene is growth
arrest specific transcript 5 (GAS5), which is a long noncoding RNA. GAS5 is
downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), and overexpression of GAS5 suppresses
cell proliferation. However, the function of SNORD44 in CRC remains largely
unknown, and the application of SNORD44 combined with GAS5 in CRC treatment has
not been reported. In this study, the expression levels of SNORD44 and GAS5 were 
measured in CRC tissues by quantitative RT-PCR. The correlation between SNORD44
and GAS5 was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. An oncolytic adenovirus
expressing SNORD44 and GAS5 (SPDD-UG) was constructed. The biological effects of 
SPDD-UG were investigated in CRC cell line SW620 and LS174T in vitro and in
xenografts. The synergistic effect of rapamycin and SPDD-UG was explored in SW620
and LS174T cells and tumors. We demonstrated that SNORD44 expression level was
markedly decreased in CRC tissues and positively correlated with GAS5 expression.
SPDD-UG significantly inhibited SW620 and LS174T cell growth and induced cell
apoptosis. Intratumoral injection of SPDD-UG significantly suppressed xenografts 
growth in nude mice. Moreover, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor, rapamycin, enhanced the antitumor effect through antagonizing the
PI3K/Akt pathway activated by SPDD-UG. These results suggest that overexpression 
of SNORD44 and GAS5 by oncolytic adenovirus provides a promising method for CRC
therapy.
