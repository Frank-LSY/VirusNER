BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported a human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence 
of 20% to 30% in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), although clinical data
on HPV involvement remain largely inconsistent, ascribed by some to differences
in HPV detection methods or in geographic origin of the studies.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and formal meta-analysis of the
literature reporting on HPV detection in LSCC.
METHODS: Literature was searched from January 1964 until March 2015. The effect
size was calculated as event rates (95% confidence interval [CI]), with
homogeneity testing using Cochran's Q and I(2) statistics. Meta-regression was
used to test the impact of study-level covariates (HPV detection method,
geographic origin) on effect size. Potential publication bias was estimated using
funnel plot symmetry.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy nine studies were eligible, comprising a sample size
of 7,347 LSCCs from different geographic regions. Altogether, 1,830 (25%) cases
tested HPV-positive considering all methods, with effect size of 0.269 (95% CI:
0.242 to 0.297; random-effects model). In meta-analysis stratified by the 1) HPV 
detection technique and 2) geographic study origin, the between-study
heterogeneity was significant only for geographic origin (P = .0001). In
meta-regression, the HPV detection method (P = .876) or geographic origin (P =
.234) were not significant study-level covariates. Some evidence for publication 
bias was found only for studies from North America and those using non-polymerase
chain reaction methods, with a marginal effect on adjusted point estimates for
both.
CONCLUSIONS: Variability in HPV detection rates in LSCC is explained by
geographic origin of study but not by HPV detection method. However, they were
not significant study-level covariates in formal meta-regression.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.
