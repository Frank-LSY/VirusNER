BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced salivary hypofunction is a common side-effect of
treatment for head and neck cancers. Patients suffer significant morbidity and
there is no suitable conventional therapy. We are conducting a Phase I clinical
trial, using a first-generation serotype 5 adenoviral (Ad5) vector encoding human
aquaporin-1 (AdhAQP1) to treat such patients. One week after the administration
of AdhAQP1 to an enrolled, generally healthy patient, E1-containing adenovirus
was detected in parotid saliva.
METHODS: The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
measure the Ad5 E1 gene and AdhAQP1 in saliva and serum. PCR and sequencing were 
used to characterize viral/vector DNA extracted from saliva. The presence of
infectious adenovirus was assessed by the inoculation of A549 cells with aliquots
of saliva. Serum Ad5 neutralizing antibodies were measured by the inhibition of
293-cell transduction with an Ad5 vector encoding luciferase. Multiple clinical
evaluations were performed.
RESULTS: On day 7 after AdhAQP1 delivery, low levels of the Ad5 E1 gene were
detected in parotid saliva (82 copies/microl). In addition, significant levels of
AdhAQP1 were also detected (1.5 x 10(3) copies/microl). The patient was
asymptomatic and subsequent analysis of parotid saliva samples prior to day 7 and
after day 7 until day 42 was negative for both virus and vector. No virus or
vector was detected in serum at any time. Detailed PCR analyses of DNA extracted 
from the day 7 parotid saliva sample suggested the absence of a recombination
event, and no infectious virus was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient most likely had a latent Ad5 infection in the targeted
parotid gland that was activated after gene transfer and was without clinical
consequence.
