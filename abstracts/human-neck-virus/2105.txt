BACKGROUND: The causal link between cervical cancer and human papilloma virus
(HPV) is well known. It is now becoming clear that some types of squamous-cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, particularly oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC), are
also linked to HPV infection. The development of vaccines against certain HPV
genotypes has changed the management strategy for HPV-associated diseases of the 
uterine cervix. An analogous approach is now being considered for the prevention 
of HPV-associated diseases of the head and neck.
METHOD: We review pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search of the
literature for phase II and III trials providing evidence about a possible effect
of HPV status on the survival rates of patients with OPC. Seven trials fulfilled 
our search criteria: four phase III trials with retrospective HPV analysis and
three phase II trials with retrospective and prospective HPV analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with HPV-positive OPC survive significantly longer than those
with HPV-negative OPC. Tobacco smoking has been identified as a negative
prognostic factor in patients with either HPV-negative or HPV-positive disease.
CONCLUSION: The established treatment strategy for OPC in patients with and
without the traditional risk factors (tobacco and alcohol consumption) is now
being reconsidered in the light of what we have learned about the role of HPV
infection. Ongoing and projected clinical trials with risk-factor stratification 
may soon lead to changes in treatment. Further study is needed to answer the
question whether HPV infection in the head and neck region is carcinogenic.
