Thirty-six patients (1-69 years) suffering from bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were subjected, during cochlear implant (CI) surgery, to a sample taking of inner ear fluid. Several types of viral genome (HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV and Enterovirus) were investigated in each sample through multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Radiological exams, serology (specific IgG and IgM) and PCR of peripheral blood were also performed.
