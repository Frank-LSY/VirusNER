An increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) was
observed in several population-based registries and has been attributed to human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In the present study, we aimed to assess the
contribution of HPV infection to the burden of mucosal head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in Slovenia. For this purpose, data from the nationwide
Cancer Registry of Slovenia for cases diagnosed between 1983 and 2009 were
analyzed to determine time trends of age-adjusted incidence rates and survival in
terms of annual percentage change (APC) for HNSCC in potentially HPV-related and 
HPV-unrelated sites. In addition, determination of p16 protein, HPV DNA and E6/E7
mRNA was performed in a cohort of OPSCC patients identified from the prospective 
database for the years 2007-2008. In total, 2,862 cases of HNSCC in potentially
HPV-related sites and 7,006 cases in potentially HPV-unrelated sites were
identified with decreased incidence observed over the time period in both groups 
(-0.58; 95 % CI -1.28 to -0.13 and -0.90; 95 % CI -1.23 to -0.57). Regardless of 
the group, incidence trends for both genders showed a significant decrease in men
and increase in women. In a cohort of 99 OPSCC patients diagnosed between 2007
and 2008, 20 (20.2 %) patients had HPV positive tumors and exhibited a superior
outcome compared to HPV-negative patients. In conclusion, results of the
epidemiologic and histopathologic study confirmed that HPV infection had no major
impact on the incidence trends in the Slovenian patients with HNSCC and,
specifically, OPSCC during the studied period.
