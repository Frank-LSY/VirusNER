Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained from 34 patients with cervical lymph node metastases were analyzed with HPV 16 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV typing. The results were correlated with the HPV status and type found in the primary tumors of OPSCC.
