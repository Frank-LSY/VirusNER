Purpose: Preclinical models have shown that the effectiveness of GL-ONC1, a
modified oncolytic vaccinia virus, is enhanced by radiation and chemotherapy. The
purpose of this study was to determine the safety of GL-ONC1 when delivered
intravenously with chemoradiotherapy to patients with primary, nonmetastatic head
and neck cancer.Experimental Design: Patients with locoregionally advanced
unresected, nonmetastatic carcinoma of the head/neck, excluding stage III-IVA
p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers, were treated with escalating doses and cycles
of intravenous GL-ONC1, along with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The primary
aims were to define the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities, and to recommend a dose
for phase II trials.Results: Between May 2012 and December 2014, 19 patients were
enrolled. The most frequent adverse reactions included grade 1-2 rigors, fever,
fatigue, and rash. Grade 3 adverse reactions included hypotension, mucositis,
nausea, and vomiting. In 2 patients, the rash was confirmed as viral in origin by
fluorescence imaging and viral plaque assay. In 4 patients, viral presence in
tumor was confirmed on midtreatment biopsy by quantitative PCR. In 1 patient,
live virus was confirmed in a tongue tumor 7 days after receiving the first dose 
of virus. The MTD was not reached. With median follow-up of 30 months, 1-year
(2-year) progression-free survival and overall survival were 74.4% (64.1%) and
84.6% (69.2%), respectively.Conclusions: Delivery of GL-ONC1 is safe and feasible
in patients with locoregionally advanced head/neck cancer undergoing standard
chemoradiotherapy. A phase II study is warranted to further investigate this
novel treatment strategy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5696-702. ©2017 AACR.
