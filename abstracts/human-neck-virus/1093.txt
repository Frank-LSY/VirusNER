Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in laryngeal carcinoma remains controversial. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of HPV in laryngeal squamous cell
carcinoma by determining presence of markers of viral infection. HPV DNA and E6*I
mRNA status was determined by type-specific E7 PCR bead-based multiplex
genotyping and RT-PCR assays in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma biopsy samples.
p16(INK4a) and COX-2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Four
cases out of 32 (13%) were HPV DNA+: HPV 11 (n = 1), HPV 31 (n = 3), HPV 59
(n = 1). One double infection: HPV 11 and HPV 31. p16(INK4a) was overexpressed in
three cases (9%) and COX-2 in 17 cases (53%). Two of four HPV DNA+ samples had
E6*I mRNA for HPV 31 and overexpressed p16(INK4a) and COX-2. HPV appears to play 
an active role in a small subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. p16(INK4a)
can be used as a surrogate marker of transcriptionally active HPV infection;
COX-2 expression had no correlation with HPV DNA and/or RNA positivity.
