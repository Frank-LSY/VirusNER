BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection has been shown to play an
integral role in the development and prognosis of various head and neck cancers. 
Generational changes in sexual behavior may have led to an increased incidence of
positivity in recent years. HPV positivity in both benign and malignant lesions
of the sinonasal cavities has been shown in previous studies (estimates range
from 20%-30% for malignancy). We intend to investigate if HPV positivity affected
survival outcomes in our patient cohort.
METHODS/MATERIALS: Twenty-six patients diagnosed pathologically for sinonasal
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with available archived biopsy specimens were
retrospectively analyzed to obtain HPV status using a real-time, multiplex
polymerase chain reaction assay that detects and quantifies 15 known high-risk
HPV types. Demographic information was collected, and survival analyses were
performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation.
RESULTS: Sixteen of 26 (62%) SCC tumors in the patient cohort were positive for
HPV DNA. HPV types 16 and 18 were the most common (n = 8 and 2, respectively),
although a wide range of HPV types across the 15 tested were positive. Survival
analyses showed a statistically significant survival advantage (median survival
of 12 vs. 54 months) when accounting for HPV positivity using log-rank testing (P
< 0.003).
CONCLUSION: HPV positivity appears to be present in a significant proportion of
squamous cell carcinoma cases of the nasal cavity. In our limited patient
population there does appear to be a survival advantage to HPV positivity.
Further prospective, multi-institutional trials with standardized treatment
protocols are needed to elucidate the true impact of HPV positivity in this
subset of head and neck cancers.
