The narrow membrane necks formed during viral, exosomal and intra-endosomal
budding from membranes, as well as during cytokinesis and related processes, have
interiors that are contiguous with the cytosol. Severing these necks involves
action from the opposite face of the membrane as occurs during the
well-characterized formation of coated vesicles. This 'reverse' (or
'inverse')-topology membrane scission is carried out by the endosomal sorting
complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, which form filaments, flat
spirals, tubes and conical funnels that are thought to direct membrane
remodelling and scission. Their assembly, and their disassembly by the ATPase
vacuolar protein sorting-associated 4 (VPS4) have been intensively studied, but
the mechanism of scission has been elusive. New insights from cryo-electron
microscopy and various types of spectroscopy may finally be close to rectifying
this situation.
