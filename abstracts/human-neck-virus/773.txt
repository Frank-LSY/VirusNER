OBJECTIVE: To analyze the infection of human papillomavirus in laryngeal squamous
cell carcinoma patients.
METHODS: The pathological samples of 64 clinical diagnosed laryngeal squamous
cell carcinoma patients were collected. Lunimex and PCR techniques were used to
detect the HPV gene infection and immunohistochemistry method was used to analyze
the HPV protein expression in the samples.
RESULTS: In the 64 cases, 7 were positive for HPV infection by Luminex and PCR
tests. 18 were positive for HPV16/18 E6 protein expression. The total positive
rate was about 39. 1%.
CONCLUSION: The high HPV infection rate in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
patients in the study indicated indirectly that the importance of the HPV
infection in pathogenesis of the laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
