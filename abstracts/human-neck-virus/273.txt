CONCLUSIONS: The detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus-1
(HSV-1) genome in perilymph of patients with negative serology or clinical
history for congenital infections supports the hypothesis that Herpesviridae,
even after acquired postnatal infections, could remain in latent phase in the
spiral ganglion and damage the cochlea by a possible subsequent reactivation.
Further studies are needed to identify the markers of such reactivation.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the presence of certain viral species in the
endolabyrinthic fluid of deaf patients with non-congenital infection. The
research of viral DNA within the inner ear is the only direct way to increase our
knowledge about the viral role in postnatal damage to the cochlea.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients (1-69 years) suffering from bilateral sensorineural 
hearing loss (SNHL) were subjected, during cochlear implant (CI) surgery, to a
sample taking of inner ear fluid. Several types of viral genome (HSV, VZV, CMV,
EBV and Enterovirus) were investigated in each sample through multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Radiological exams, serology (specific IgG and IgM) and PCR of
peripheral blood were also performed.
RESULTS: While the research of the viral genome in peripheral blood was negative 
in all patients, multiplex PCR on endolabyrinthic fluid samples was positive in
three patients (two cases of CMV-DNA and one case of HSV-1 DNA).
