BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common type of head and neck
cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to detect the expression of Epstein-Barr viral Rta
protein in patients with untreated NPC, and compare the serum Rta-IgG with the
VCA-IgA in patients with NPC.
METHODS: In the current work, the nasopharyngeal tissues of untreated NPC
patients (n= 13) and non-NPC controls (n= 10) were collected for the
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to analyze the levels of Rta protein
expression, meanwhile serum samples from the participants were prepared to assess
the roles of Rta-IgG level with Enzyme-linked immunosorbence assay (ELISA) in
diagnosis of NPC including the patients with NPC, the patients with other
cancers, and normal volunteers.
RESULTS: The levels of serum Rta-IgG in 26 NPC patients were monitored at pre-
and post-treatments, as well as one to two year after. We found that there was a 
significant difference of the expression levels of Rta protein between NPC and
non-NPC groups (P< 0.05). Correspondingly, the levels of serum Rta-IgG in NPC
patients (3.05, 1.19-4.95) were significantly higher than those of non-NPC
participants (0.15, 0.08-0.30, P< 0.05) including the patients with lung cancer
(0.14, 0.08-0.19), the patients with breast carcinoma (0.17, 0.10-0.25), the
patients with gastric carcinoma (0.08, 0.05-0.16), the patients with malignant
lymphoma (0.13, 0.08-0.20), the patients with benign nasopharyngeal disease
(1.65, 0.74-1.93) and healthy volunteers (0.22, 0.13-0.32), respectively. With a 
receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis, the cut-off value to
discriminate NPC patients from the controls was established at 0.92 (S/CO) for
Rta-IgG (sensitivity 83.6%; specificity 82.4%), the diagnosis efficacy of Rta-IgG
was higher than VCA-IgA. The positive rates of Rta-IgG were related to clinical
stage, but not metastatic sites. Serum concentrations of Rta-IgG were decreased
in NPC patients with effective radiation, and slightly raised or with no change
with ineffective radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Rta expression levels are elevated in the patients with NPC, and
serum Rta-IgG is a promising biomarker in both differential diagnosis and
therapy-monitoring of the patients with NPC.
