Lymphadenitis caused by H1N1 vaccination: case report.

Toy H, Karasoy D, Keser M.

A patient admitted to hospital for a supraclavicular painful mass.
Ultrasonography showed soliter lymphadenopathy. He underwent H1N1 vaccination 1
week before this lymphadenopathy developed. Groosly the mass measured
1cmx0.8cmx0.8cm. It was round, yellow to brown, slightly soft. In pathologic
examination, we detected edema in capsule of lymph node. The basic architecture
was preserved. There was mottled appearance caused by marked proliferation of
immunoblasts which were positive with CD 30. Also large, unusual immunoblasts
which closely resemble mononuclear hodgkin cells were present. These unusual
immunoblasts were positive with CD 30, too. For differential diagnosis, at first 
we should regard hodgkin lymphoma. We suggested that lymphadenitis may be a side 
effect of H1N1 vaccination.
