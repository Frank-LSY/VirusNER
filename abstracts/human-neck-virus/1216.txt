PURPOSE: To understand the effects of HIV type 1 on the function of the
masticatory muscles.
METHODS: Sixty individuals were selected from both genders, aged between 22 and
57years (mean 36.77±9.33years), and divided into two groups: Group HIVG, 30
individuals with HIV subtype 1, and Group CG, 30 healthy individuals (control
group). The individuals were submitted to assessments of their masticatory muscle
activity, biting strength and thickness of the masticatory muscles by means of
electromyography, maximal molar bite force and ultrasound imaging, respectively. 
The resultant data were statistically analyzed by t-tests (p<0.05).
RESULTS: The HIVG normalized EMG data from a mandibular rest position,
protrusion, right and left laterality movement of the jaw showed that HIVG
presented a relative increase in EMG activity compared to the CG. The HIVG had a 
lower masticatory cycle ability while chewing Parafilm M®, Raisins and Peanuts
when compared to CG. During rest conditions, the ultrasound images showed a
greater average muscular thickness in the right and left temporal region compared
to CG. Upon maximal voluntary contraction, an increased average thickness was
seen in the temporalis muscles and left sternocleidomastoid muscle when compared 
to the CG.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that
individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome showed muscular changes
related to the stomatognathic system, especially concerning EMG activity and
muscle thickness.
