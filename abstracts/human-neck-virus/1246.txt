Transoral surgery (TOS) is a novel technology whose adoption is expanding in the 
United States and other countries. TOS offers the possibility of a minimally
invasive surgical approach to head and neck cancers. Its most frequent
application has been in oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), of which most are associated
with human papillomavirus (HPV). For HPV-associated OPC, where high response and 
survival rates are expected, deintensification of standard therapy is a major
area of clinical research. In HPV-OPC, traditional pathologic risk factors
indicating a need for adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation may not apply as
strongly.
