Oral focal fibrous hyperplasia and squamous cell papilloma treated with an erbium
laser. Case presentation.

Boj J, Hernandez M, Espasa E, Espanya A.

Mouth and oropharynx cancer constitute 5% of all malignancies; 95% of them are
head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Carcinogenesis is a multifactor process. 
Mutagenesis is also determined by the human papilloma virus which has recently
been found to be etiologically associated with 20 to 25% of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas, mostly in the oropharinx. Focal fibrous hyperplasia of 
the connective tissue comes up as an answer to a chronic irritation in which a
big amount of collagen can be found. As there exist certain clinical resemblance 
between squamous cell papilloma, fibrous focal hyperplasia and other mesenchimal 
tumors it is recommended to proceed, always, with removal and study. Two cases,
one of an oral papilloma and another of a focal fibrous hyperplasia in pediatric 
patients, treated with an Er,Cr:YSGG laser wave length (mu) of 2780 nm are
presented.
