Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) accounts for up to 25% of all HNSCCs. These tumors largely arise from the
oropharynx, particularly the tonsil and base of tongue. The first manifestation
of HPV-associated HNSCC is frequently as metastasis to cervical lymph nodes that 
can be documented by fine-needle aspiration. These metastases are often cystic
with a predominantly non-keratinizing, basaloid morphology. Knowledge of the HPV 
status of metastatic HNSCC has significant treatment and prognostic implications 
as HPV-associated tumors have a more favorable prognosis than conventional HNSCC.
Accordingly, HPV testing should be performed on any squamous cell carcinoma of
unknown primary identified in neck lymph nodes. HPV detection may be performed
using a variety of methods including p16 as a surrogate immunohistochemical
marker, in situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction detection of viral
DNA or RNA. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal method for
HPV detection in fine-needle aspiration specimens. Cytology screening for
HPV-associated HNSCC does not appear to be effective. Greater understanding of
the natural history of oral HPV infections is needed before knowing if oral HPV
testing may be useful as a screening test.
