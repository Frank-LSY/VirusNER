BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are among the most
aggressive types of cancer. The Simian virus 40 (SV40), which is a polyomavirus
known for its oncogenic potential, was found as a contaminant of oral vaccines
and has been related to human pleomorphic adenoma in the parotid gland. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the presence of SV40 and 2 human polyomaviruses-BK 
virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV)-in a large sample of SCCs of the oral cavity.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
evaluate virus load.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of SV40, BKV, and JCV in oral SCC was
negligible. Matched-pair case-control analysis indicated that prevalence among
the controls did not significantly differ with respect to analyzed cases.
CONCLUSION: The results did not indicate a major role for SV40, BKV, and JCV in
the etiology of oral SCC.
