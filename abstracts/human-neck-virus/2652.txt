PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the changing landscape and significant developments
in the diagnosis and management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
RECENT FINDINGS: High-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have been recognized as
important causative factors for oropharyngeal cancer. The diagnosis is
established with type-specific and broad-spectrum in-situ hybridization probes
and/or p16 immunohistochemistry assays on fresh frozen paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks. HPV-associated tumors have superior response and outcomes compared with
HPV-unrelated tumors. Retrospective studies have been able to stratify
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma based on HPV status, tumor stage, nodal
stage, and smoking history into risk groups with differing risks of death or
distant disease. Selected patients, nonsmokers with less advanced nodal stage,
may be overtreated with current treatment paradigms, and deintensification of
curative therapy is a current research focus for these patients. Smokers,
patients with advanced nodal or tumor stage, and those with HPV-unrelated cancers
have a less favorable prognosis and the search for novel targets is particularly 
important for these patients.
SUMMARY: The present review will highlight the current standards and the future
direction of novel therapies in both HPV-associated and HPV-unrelated cancers.
