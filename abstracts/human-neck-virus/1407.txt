Recent studies suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) is an emerging risk
factor of head and neck cancer (HNC), particularly for oropharyngeal cancer.
Studies from the West showed a rising trend of HPV-related HNC despite a decrease
of the overall HNC incidence. In contrast, the overall HNC incidence in Taiwan
has continued to rise. It is not clear whether the incidence trends of
HPV-related HNC in Taiwan have a similar pattern to those from countries with an 
overall decreasing incidence of HNC. This study examined the incidence trends of 
HPV-related and HPV-unrelated HNC in Taiwan using data from the Taiwan Cancer
Registry. Our results showed that the incidence trends of HPV-related and
HPV-unrelated HNC in Taiwan both rose during 1995-2009. The incidence of
HPV-related HNC (1.3 per 100,000 in 1995 to 3.3 in 2009, annual percentage change
(APC) = 6.9, p < 0.0001) rose more rapidly than the incidence of HPV-unrelated
HNC (10.4 per 100,000 in 1995 to 21.7 in 2009, APC = 5.0, p < 0.0001). The rising
trend of HPV-related HNC was particularly prominent for HNC occurring in tonsil
(APC = 8.2, p < 0.0001), in men (APC = 7.5, p < 0.0001), and in those aged
between 40 and 50 years (APC = 8.5, p < 0.0001). Although the overall incidence
of HNC in Taiwan has continued to increase, the most rapid rise is in the
HPV-related HNC. This suggests that similar to the Western world, HPV-related HNC
is becoming an important public health issue in Taiwan.
