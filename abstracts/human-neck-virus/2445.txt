BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been proved as one of the
etiological factors of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Patients
with tumors of viral etiology have a lower recurrence rate and better prognosis. 
OPSCC is linked to an alteration in the immune system. Only a limited number of
studies have correlated both the immunological parameters and HPV status with
patient prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether HPV infection
and the immunological status influence patient prognosis individually or in
concurrence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients with oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas were 
enrolled. They were divided into HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups based on
the expression of HPV 16 E6 mRNA. Basic lymphocyte subpopulations were determined
in the peripheral blood by means of flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Significantly better disease-specific survival (DSS) was observed in
patients with HPV-positive tumors. Nodal status, tumor grade, recurrence, and
CD8+/Tregs ratio were identified as factors influencing DSS. A higher level of
Tregs and a lower ratio of CD8/Tregs influenced overall survival (OS)
independently of HPV status and age. Patients with HPV-positive tumors and high
levels of Tregs survived significantly better than patients from the other
groups.
CONCLUSION: Better survival is associated with HPV positivity and elevated Tregs 
levels. Our data suggest that HPV infection and Tregs do not influence patient
prognosis in concurrence.
