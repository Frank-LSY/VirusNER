PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common 
human cancer types with a very poor prognosis despite improvements in therapeutic
modalities. The major known risk factors are tobacco use and alcohol consumption 
or infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPV), especially in
oropharyngeal tumors. The current management based on the assessment of a variety
of clinical and pathological parameters does not sufficiently predict outcome.
METHODS: Chromosomal alterations detected in HNSCCs were characterized by
metaphase comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and correlated with clinical
parameters as well as survival time. Candidate regions were validated by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH)
on dapped tumor tissue and liquid-based cytological smear preparations. In
addition, HPV status was determined by polymerase chain reaction and simultaneous
immunocytochemical p16INK4a-Ki67 staining.
RESULTS: The most frequent DNA copy number gains were observed on chromosome arms
3q, 8q, 5p, 7q, 12p, and 12q. DNA copy number decreases occurred most frequently 
at 3p, 17p, 4q, and 5q. FISH analysis verified in part the observed alterations
by CGH on dapped tissues and was especially able to detect the most frequent DNA 
copy changes in cytological specimens.
CONCLUSION: The combination of HPV status and prognostic copy number alteration
detected by FISH in biopsies or cytological specimens may be an applicable
protocol for screening head and neck cancer patients prior to therapy.
