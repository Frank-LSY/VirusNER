High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the principal cause of various cancers
including cervical cancer, anal cancer, vulvar cancer, and some head and neck
cancers. In the viral life cycle, by interacting with both viral and host DNA and
proteins, the HPV E2 protein plays a pivotal role in viral transcriptional
regulation and DNA replication, and it is also associated with modification of
various cellular processes, including host gene transcription, RNA processing,
apoptosis, ubiquitination, and intracellular trafficking, to create a convenient 
environment for a replicative cycle of the virus and contribute to the HPV
pathogenesis. Elucidating the roles of E2 protein throughout the viral life cycle
will improve our understanding of the viral life cycle and pathogenesis and help 
us identify novel antiviral agents with therapeutic potential. This article
reviews the research progress in the structure, roles, and activity of high-risk 
HPV E2 protein, particularly that of HPV-16.
