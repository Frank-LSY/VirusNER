The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC),
which is both biologically and clinically distinct from tobacco- and
alcohol-related OPSCC, is dramatically increasing. The finding that individuals
with HPV-positive local/regionally advanced OPSCC have a significantly better
prognosis than their negative counterparts have led to efforts to de-escalate
treatment in those patients to avoid serious side effects and to improve their
long-term quality of life, while maintaining treatment efficacy. Identifying
diagnostic tests that are able to distinguish cancers etiologically associated
with HPV is thus becoming a pressing challenge for researchers. The purpose of
this review is to provide an overview of the diagnostic tools presently available
to evaluate HPV status in patients with OPSCC and, in particular, to discuss
their strengths and weaknesses in identifying those infections that are the real 
driving force in the oropharyngeal carcinogenesis process.
