BACKGROUND: The genetic profile for human papilloma virus positive (HPV+)
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) remains largely unknown. The
purpose of this study was to sequence tissue material from a large cohort of
locoregionally-advanced HPV+ OPSCCs.
METHODS: We performed targeted deep sequencing of 395 cancer-associated genes in 
114 matched tumor/normal loco-regionally advanced HPV+ OPSCCs. Mutations and copy
number aberrations were determined.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 3459 mutations with an average of 10 mutations 
per megabase and a median of 28 variants per sample. The most frequently mutated 
genes were KALRN (28%), SPTBN1 (32%), KMT2A (31%), ZNRF3 (9%), BNC2 (12%), NOTCH2
(25%), FGFR2 (12%), SMAD2 (6%), and AR (13%). Our findings were dominated by
COSMIC signature 5 and 12, represented in other head and neck cancers and in
hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified multiple genetic aberrations in HPV+ OPSCCs, and 
the COSMIC signature 12 as most prevalent. The mutations harbour both therapeutic
and prognostic potential.
