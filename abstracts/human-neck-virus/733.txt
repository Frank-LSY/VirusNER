INTRODUCTION: Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the main etiological agents for
the development of most ano-genital cancers and for a subset of head and neck
neoplasias. The oncogenic capacity of HPV is due to the combined activity of the 
viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. A defining feature of all HPV associated cancers is
the continued retention and expression of these two viral oncoproteins throughout
the development of the disease, and this highlights their value as potential
targets for therapeutic intervention, in HPV-induced malignancies.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors focus on the HPV E6 oncoprotein
functions and its interactions with cellular targets containing either LxxLL
motifs or PDZ domains. New approaches leading to the prevention such interactions
are described, showing the advantage of E6 as a target for therapeutic
intervention against malignant transformation and cancer.
EXPERT OPINION: The high degree of conservation in E6-LxxLL interactions across
multiple HPV types makes this a compelling therapeutic target for pathologies
caused by diverse HPV types. Combining this with therapeutics directed against
E6-PDZ interactions offers great promise for the treatment of malignancies caused
by high-risk HPV types.
