OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to infect the
tissues of the oropharynx as demonstrated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (OPSCC). HPV has also been shown to induce benign lymphoid
hypertrophy. We sought to investigate an association between obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) and the presence of HPV in palatine and lingual tonsillar
oropharyngeal tissue.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
METHODS: This retrospective laboratory-based study of oropharyngeal tissue from
patients with OSA included patients >18 years old who underwent surgical
treatment for OSA at a single institution between January 2012 and May 2014.
Surgical specimens of adequate size were analyzed for HPV6, 11, and 16 using
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction from DNA extracted from
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Student t test, Pearson χ2 test, 
and linear logistic regression were used to assess comparisons of body mass index
(BMI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, and gender between HPV-positive and
HPV-negative groups.
RESULTS: Of 99 cases included in the study, six were positive for HPV: two with
HPV16 and four with HPV6. BMI, AHI, age, and gender showed no significant
differences between the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. Logistic regression
to predict HPV positivity accounting for each variable and multivariate analysis 
were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not show HPV to have a statistically significant
association with OSA. None of the covariates analyzed (BMI, AHI, gender, age)
predicted HPV positivity in surgically resected oropharyngeal tissue from OSA
patients.
