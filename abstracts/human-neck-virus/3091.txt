BACKGROUND: The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) associated factor 3 (TRAF3)
is a key node in innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways. TRAF3 negatively 
regulates the activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and is
one of the key proteins in antiviral immunity.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here we provide a structural overview of TRAF3 signaling in
terms of its competitive binding and consequences to the cellular network. For
completion, we also include molecular mimicry of TRAF3 physiological partners by 
some viral proteins.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: By out-competing host partners, viral proteins aim to subvert 
TRAF3 antiviral action. Mechanistically, dynamic, competitive binding by the
organism's own proteins and same-site adaptive pathogen mimicry follow the same
conformational selection principles.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our premise is that irrespective of the eliciting event -
physiological or acquired pathogenic trait - pathway activation (or suppression) 
may embrace similar conformational principles. However, even though here we
largely focus on competitive binding at a shared site, similar to physiological
signaling other pathogen subversion mechanisms can also be at play. This article
