INTRODUCTION: Cervical lymphadenopathies of unknown primary represent 3 % of head
and neck cancers. Their diagnostic work up has largely changed in recent years.
This review provides an update on diagnostic developments and their potential
therapeutic impact.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a systematic review of the literature.
RESULTS: In recent years, changes in epidemiology-based prognostic factors such
as human papilloma virus (HPV) cancers, advances in imaging and minimally
invasive surgery have been integrated in the management of cervical
lymphadenopathies of unknown primary. In particular, systematic use of PET
scanner and increasing practice of robotic or laser surgery have contributed to
increasing detection rate of primary cancers. These allow more adapted and
personalized treatments. The impact of changes in the eighth TNM staging system
is discussed.
CONCLUSION: The management of cervical lymphadenopathies of unknown primary
cancer has changed significantly in the last 10 years. On the other hand,
practice changes will have to be assessed.
