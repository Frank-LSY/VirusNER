The importance of detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has resulted in a growing expectation for HPV testing of clinical samples. Although testing protocols vary, most pertain to primary tumor biopsies/resections. Testing of fine-needle aspirates and core biopsies (FNACBs) is advantageous, but it is unclear whether technical and biological factors adversely affect the fidelity of HPV detection in these samples.
