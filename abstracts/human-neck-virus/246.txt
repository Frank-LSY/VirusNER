OBJECTIVES: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is known to be associated with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) and may potentially play a vital
role in tumor metastasis. The purpose of this study was to correlate HPV status
of cervical lymph node metastases with their respective primary OPSCC tumor.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained from 34
patients with cervical lymph node metastases were analyzed with HPV 16 DNA
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV typing. The
results were correlated with the HPV status and type found in the primary tumors 
of OPSCC.
RESULTS: Comparing HPV DNA status with p16 we found that 21 primary tumors and
lymph node metastases were HPV positive (61.8%) and seven primary tumors and
lymph node metastases were HPV negative (20.6%). Six patient samples differed
when correlating the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis (17.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, HPV status in OPSCCs and their cervical lymph node
metastases correlated in the vast majority of cases. However, HPV detection
methods may have certain limitations resulting in varying degree of
non-correlation. This should be taken into account when stratifying treatment in 
regard to HPV status.
