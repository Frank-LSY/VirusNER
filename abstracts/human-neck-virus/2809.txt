Herpes simplex virus infection of the larynx is an exceedingly rare clinical
entity, most frequently reported in the pediatric population or in
immunocompromised adults. We present a 62-year-old woman presented with neck
pain, hoarseness, crepitus over the larynx, and what appeared to be a necrotic
mass of the right true vocal cord on laryngoscopy. Due to near-complete
destruction of the cartilaginous framework of the larynx, a total laryngectomy
was performed. The final pathology report showed squamous mucosal changes
consistent with herpes simplex infection, confirmed by immunohistochemical
staining. Though herpes simplex laryngitis is uncommon, this case shows the
potential for herpes simplex to cause extensive damage and compromise airway
patency when left untreated.
