The regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is important for a 
variety of cellular functions. ELL/EAF-containing little elongation complex (LEC)
was found to be required for transcription of Pol II-dependent small nuclear RNA 
(snRNA) genes. It was shown that the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with ELL and 
inhibits transcription elongation activity of ELL. Here, we show that p53
inhibits interaction between ELL/EAF and ICE1 in LEC and thereby p53 represses
transcription of Pol II-dependent snRNA genes through inhibiting LEC function.
Furthermore, induction of p53 expression by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation
decreases the occupancy of ICE1 at Pol II-dependent snRNA genes. Consistent with 
the results, knockdown of p53 increased both the expression of snRNA genes and
the occupancy of Pol II and components of LEC at snRNA genes. Our results
indicate that p53 interferes with the interaction between ELL/EAF and ICE1 and
represses transcription of snRNA genes by Pol II.
