BACKGROUND: This study provides Australian data on the characteristics of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) over the
last 2 decades.
METHODS: The HPV status of 515 patients with oropharyngeal SCC diagnosed between 
1987 and 2010 was determined by HPV E6-targeted multiplex real time polymerase
chain reaction assay (PCR) and p16 immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The HPV positivity rate increased from 20.2% (1987-1995) to 63.5%
(2006-2010). Among HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC over the study period, the
median age increased from 55.4 years to 59.8 years (p = .004) and there was a
trend of an increasing proportion of never smokers (19.2% to 34.0%). The use of
radiation therapy (RT) in patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer
increased from 26.9% to 68.1% (p = .007) and we also observed a trend of improved
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our data show a rising prevalence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC
in Australia over the last 2 decades. These patients with HPV-positive
oropharyngeal SCC are now presenting at an older age and about one third have
never smoked.
