HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease, but the overwhelming
majority of individuals clear the infection. A small percentage of individuals
develop persistence of oncogenic HPV types, especially HPV-16; and as a result,
squamous cell carcinoma can develop in the tonsils and base of the tongue. Over
70% of oropharyngeal cancers are now thought to be associated with oncogenic HPV 
infection. Immunohistochemistry for p16 protein is often used as a surrogate
marker for oncogenic HPV in the oropharyngeal tissues, although alternative HPV
DNA testing methods are under intensive study. The clinical profile of patients
with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) differs quite notably from that of
traditional head and neck cancer patients, and the prognosis for HPV-associated
OPC is significantly better. As a result, experimental clinical trials are
focused on de-intensification of therapies with the hope of preserving an
improved long-term quality of life for these patients.
