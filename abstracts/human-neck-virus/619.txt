Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a single-stranded RNA virus, is one of the most serious
neurotropic pathogens in the Asia-Pacific region. Through interactions with host 
proteins, the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of EV71 is important for viral
replication. To gain a protein profile that interact with the EV71 5'UTR in
neuronal cells, we performed a biotinylated RNA-protein pull-down assay in
conjunction with LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 109 proteins were detected and
subjected to Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) analyses. These proteins were found to be highly correlated with
biological processes including RNA processing/splicing, epidermal cell
differentiation, and protein folding. A protein-protein interaction network was
constructed using the STRING online database to illustrate the interactions of
those proteins that are mainly involved in RNA processing/splicing or protein
folding. Moreover, we confirmed that the far-upstream element binding protein 3
(FBP3) was able to bind to the EV71 5'UTR. The redistribution of FBP3 in
subcellular compartments was observed after EV71 infection, and the decreased
expression of FBP3 in host neuronal cells markedly inhibited viral replication.
Our results reveal various host proteins that potentially interact with the EV71 
5'UTR in neuronal cells, and we found that FBP3 could serve as a positive
regulator in host cells.
