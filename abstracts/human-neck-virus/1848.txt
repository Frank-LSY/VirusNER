Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common, morbid, and frequently
lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome
sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational
profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papillomavirus was detectable by 
sequencing DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known 
HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), our analysis revealed many
genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30% of cases
harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (for example, 
NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC
carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale
sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.
