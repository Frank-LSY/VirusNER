BACKGROUND: In 2015, a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred following a single patient exposure in 
an emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary-care hospital in
Seoul, South Korea. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV outbreak
in our hospital.
METHODS: We identified all patients and health-care workers who had been in the
emergency room with the index case between May 27 and May 29, 2015. Patients were
categorised on the basis of their exposure in the emergency room: in the same
zone as the index case (group A), in different zones except for overlap at the
registration area or the radiology suite (group B), and in different zones (group
C). We documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, confirmed by real-time PCR testing
of sputum samples. We analysed attack rates, incubation periods of the virus, and
risk factors for transmission.
FINDINGS: 675 patients and 218 health-care workers were identified as contacts.
MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 82 individuals (33 patients, eight
health-care workers, and 41 visitors). The attack rate was highest in group A
(20% [23/117] vs 5% [3/58] in group B vs 1% [4/500] in group C; p<0·0001), and
was 2% (5/218) in health-care workers. After excluding nine cases (because of
inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data
from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 2-17, IQR
5-10). The median incubation period was significantly shorter in group A than in 
group C (5 days [IQR 4-8] vs 11 days [6-12]; p<0·0001). There were no confirmed
cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on May 29 and who
were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact 
with the index case. The main risk factor for transmission of MERS-CoV was the
location of exposure.
INTERPRETATION: Our results showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV
from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling
evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging
infectious diseases.
