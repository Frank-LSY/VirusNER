Point-of-care molecular diagnostics can provide efficient and cost-effective
medical care, and they have the potential to fundamentally change our approach to
global health. However, most existing approaches are not scalable to include
multiple biomarkers. As a solution, we have combined commercial flat panel OLED
display technology with protein microarray technology to enable high-density
fluorescent, programmable, multiplexed biorecognition in a compact and disposable
configuration with clinical-level sensitivity. Our approach leverages advances in
commercial display technology to reduce pre-functionalized biosensor substrate
costs to pennies per cm(2). Here, we demonstrate quantitative detection of IgG
antibodies to multiple viral antigens in patient serum samples with detection
limits for human IgG in the 10â€‰pg/mL range. We also demonstrate multiplexed
detection of antibodies to the HPV16 proteins E2, E6, and E7, which are
circulating biomarkers for cervical as well as head and neck cancers.
