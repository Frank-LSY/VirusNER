OBJECTIVE: We report deafness occurring as an extremely rare complication of
influenza A caused by the H1N1 virus ('swine flu'), in two children.
METHODS: Case reports and review of the literature concerning influenza A (H1N1) 
and acquired viral infection causing deafness.
RESULTS: Two children with normal hearing developed bilateral deafness following 
influenza A (H1N1). The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. 
Both patients were treated with oseltamivir.
CONCLUSION: Following a review of the literature, these two patients appear to be
the first reported cases of bilateral deafness following influenza A (H1N1).
