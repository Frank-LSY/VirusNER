We present a 56-year-old man with a two-year history of erythematous nodules and 
plaques on the forehead, frontal aspect of the scalp, and left side of the neck. 
Histopathologic findings are compatible with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL). We present a brief review of primary cutaneous DLBCLs and
address the putative association between DLBCLs and hepatitis C virus infection.
