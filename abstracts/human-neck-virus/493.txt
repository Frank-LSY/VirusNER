Diversity of TTV1 was assessed in the head and neck region in patients with
potentially malignant (oral lichen planus, oral leukoplakia) and malignant
lesions (oral and laryngeal squamous cell cancers) and was compared to that found
in the uterine cervix (cervical atypia and cervical cancer) by directly
sequencing the NG061-063 segment of ORF1. These sequences were classified by the 
formerly used genogroup-genotype system as well as by the newly accepted species 
classification by aligning with the corresponding region of the type sequences of
the 29 TTV species. All sequences obtained during the study clustered together
with the TTV1 type sequence; to express diversity within TTV1, genotypes and
subtypes of the former classification were used.The commonest subtypes were 2c
followed by 2b, 1a and 1b. Subtypes 2b and 2c were evenly distributed among
cervical samples; subtype 1a was more frequent in patients with cervical atypia
or cancer. Subtypes 2c was more frequent than 2b in head and neck lesions. In
conclusion, genotype and even subtype distribution may be important in
association with diseases, therefore using this classification for
characterization of intraspecies diversity of TTV1 is proposed.
