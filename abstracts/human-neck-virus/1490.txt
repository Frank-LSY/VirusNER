Engineering autologous or allogeneic T cells to express a suicide gene can
control potential toxicity in adoptive T-cell therapies. We recently reported the
development of a novel human suicide gene system that is based on an orphan human
cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP4B1, and the naturally occurring alkylator prodrug
4-ipomeanol. The goal of this study was to systematically develop a clinically
applicable self-inactivating lentiviral vector for efficient co-expression of
CYP4B1 as an ER-located protein with two distinct types of cell surface proteins,
either MACS selection genes for donor lymphocyte infusions after allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptors for retargeting primary T
cells. The U3 region of the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus in combination with 
the T2A site was found to drive high-level expression of our CYP4B1 mutant with
truncated CD34 or CD271 as MACS suitable selection markers. This lentiviral
vector backbone was also well suited for co-expression of CYP4B1 with a
codon-optimized CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct. Finally,
4-ipomeanol efficiently induced apoptosis in primary T cells that co-express
mutant CYP4B1 and the divergently located MACS selection and CAR genes. In
conclusion, we here developed a clinically suited lentiviral vector that supports
high-level co-expression of cell surface proteins with a potent novel human
suicide gene.
