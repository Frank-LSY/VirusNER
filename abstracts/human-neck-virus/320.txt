Fifty (20%) patients were HPV-positive, 63 (28%) overexpressed p16(INK4a), and 44 (19%) were positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) (high concordance between HPV-positivity and p16(INK4a) status, Îº=0.72). HPV-16 was most common (84%), followed by HPV-18 (10%), HPV-33 (4%) and HPV-69 (2%). HPV and p16(INK4a) prevalence was highest for SCCs of the oropharynx, followed by hypopharynx, larynx and oral cavity (HPV and p16(INK4a)p<0.0001). HPV prevalence and p16(INK4a)-overexpression were significantly higher in younger than older patients (HPV p=0.001; p16 (INK4a)p=0.003). Heavy smokers had lower HPV prevalence than non- or moderate smokers (p=0.017). Gender and alcohol consumption were not associated with HPV or p16(INK4a) status. HPV-positive tumours had significantly lower cyclin D1 and higher p21(WAF1) expression than HPV-negative tumours.
