INTRODUCTION: Approximately 10% of patients with peripheral facial nerve palsy
are children. Facial nerve palsy is usually idiopathic. An uncommon cause is
herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome). This syndrome usually affects adults
and is rare in children.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature and describe the cause, clinical
manifestations, and treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. We also report a case of
the syndrome in a 12-year-old boy.
CONCLUSION: Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by peripheral facial paralysis 
associated with herpetic eruption on the auricula and external ear, and by
vestibulocochlear dysfunction. It occurs by reactivation of latent
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion, affecting the seventh
and eighth cranial nerves. The diagnosis is based on history and physical
findings. Treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome uses a combination of high-dose
corticosteroids and acyclovir. Although the prognosis is better in children than 
in adults, it is not good enough.
