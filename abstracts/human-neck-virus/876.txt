APOBEC3B is a newly identified source of mutation in many cancers, including
breast, head/neck, lung, bladder, cervical, and ovarian. APOBEC3B is a member of 
the APOBEC3 family of enzymes that deaminate DNA cytosine to produce the
pro-mutagenic lesion, uracil. Several APOBEC3 family members function to restrict
virus replication. For instance, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H
combine to restrict HIV-1 in human lymphocytes. HIV-1 counteracts these APOBEC3s 
with the viral protein Vif, which targets the relevant APOBEC3s for proteasomal
degradation. While APOBEC3B does not restrict HIV-1 and is not targeted by HIV-1 
Vif in CD4-positive T cells, we asked whether related lentiviral Vif proteins
could degrade APOBEC3B. Interestingly, several SIV Vif proteins are capable of
promoting APOBEC3B degradation, with SIVmac239 Vif proving the most potent. This 
likely occurs through the canonical polyubiquitination mechanism as APOBEC3B
protein levels are restored by MG132 treatment and by altering a conserved E3
ligase-binding motif. We further show that SIVmac239 Vif can prevent APOBEC3B
mediated geno/cytotoxicity and degrade endogenous APOBEC3B in several cancer cell
lines. Our data indicate that the APOBEC3B degradation potential of SIV Vif is an
effective tool for neutralizing the cancer genomic DNA deaminase APOBEC3B.
Further optimization of this natural APOBEC3 antagonist may benefit cancer
therapy.
