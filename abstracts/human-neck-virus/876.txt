Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) suffer disproportionate psychosocial distress because of the nature of the tumor site, the possible impact on facial appearance and function, and the symptom burden resulting from treatment. Unmet psychosocial needs can negatively impact many aspects of care, from compliance to successful survivorship. This article reviews the challenges that patients with HNC confront throughout the disease trajectory from diagnosis to treatment, recovery, and long-term survivorship. It also provides a framework for understanding psychosocial adjustment and quality of life both for the general population of patients with HNC, and those with human papillomavirus-related diagnoses.
