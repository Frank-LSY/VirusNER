BACKGROUND: It is unclear why human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has improved clinical behavior compared to
HPV-negative HNSCC. We sought to better characterize the immune microenvironment 
of tongue cancers by examining the CD3 and CD8 TIL pattern in HPV-positive and
HPV-negative tumors.
METHODS: Histologic sections from 40 oral tongue and oropharyngeal cases were
analyzed (n=21 HPV DNA-positive, n=19 HPV DNA-negative). CD3 and CD8 T-cell
immunostaining were performed on whole-slide sections to quantify
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density and assess its morphology.
RESULTS: A subset of cases (HPV-positive) displayed a unique TIL pattern
consisting of circumferential peritumoral population T cells, which was absent in
the HPV-negative cases. The presence of peritumoral cuffing was strongly
predictive of improved recurrence-free survival compared to cases that lacked
this morphologic pattern of immune infiltrate. Four HPV-positive cases lacked the
pattern, including two cases with disease recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we show an architectural pattern of immune
infiltrate in HNSCC is seen exclusively in HPV-positive patients with improved
recurrence-free survival and suggests an organized host immunological response
contributes to disease control.
