OBJECTIVE: To evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence in the tonsil using 
extensive ex vivo brushing and gargling in a large age-stratified sample of
cancer-free patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2012 to 2016, consecutive patients undergoing
tonsillectomy for benign indications in 19 French University Hospitals were
invited to participate in the SPLIT study. Immediately after resection,
half-tonsils were extensively brushed at the pathology laboratories on the
surface epithelium and in tonsil crypts to collect exfoliated cells. In 11
centers, patients aged 15 and over (adults) were also asked to provide gargle
samples before surgery. HPV-DNA detection used a very sensitive Luminex
technology to evaluate 21 HPV types.
RESULTS: Tonsil brushings from 692 patients aged 1-70 years and gargles from 268 
adults were tested for HPV. Among adults, overall HPV prevalence was 3.6% in
tonsil brushings and 13.1% in gargles and HPV16 prevalence was 2.2% and 4.1%,
respectively. Among 139 children, tonsil brushings were positive in two girls
(1.4%). Percent agreement in HPV detection in paired tonsil brushings and gargles
in adults was 85.8% and positive agreement 9.5%. HPV prevalence in gargles
significantly varied by sex (prevalence ratio in men vs women=2.1; 95% confidence
interval; 1.1-4.1) and tonsillectomy indication (non-infectious vs.
infectious=4.9; 1.4-17.0).
CONCLUSION: HPV infection is infrequent in tonsil brushings of cancer-free
children and adults. In contrast, HPV infection in gargles in adults is rather
common. Low agreement in paired tonsil brushings and gargles suggests that gargle
is not representative of HPV prevalence in the tonsil.
