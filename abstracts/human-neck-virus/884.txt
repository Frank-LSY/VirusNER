Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is a biologically aggressive neoplasm mainly
found in the head and neck region. Recently, four cases of basaloid squamous cell
carcinoma of the bladder have been reported, and three of them occurred in
patients with neurogenic bladder, repeated catheterizations and human
papillomavirus infection of the urinary tract. To the best of our knowledge, none
of the patients affected by basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder
described in the literature had documented genital involvement by human
papillomavirus. Herein, we describe the case of a woman with neurogenic bladder
affected by basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and by a concomitant 
genital tract human papillomavirus infection.
