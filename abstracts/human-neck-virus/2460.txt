Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is a major risk for development of
oropharyngeal squamous-cell-carcinoma (OPSCC). Although HPV+ OPSCC metastasize
faster than HPV- tumors, they have a better prognosis. The molecular and cellular
alterations underlying this pathobiology of HPV+ OPSCC remain elusive. In this
study, we examined whether expression of HPV16-E6E7 targets the number of
migratory and stationary cancer stem cells (CSC). Furthermore, we wanted to
elucidate if aberrantly expressed miRNAs in migratory CSC may be responsible for 
progression of OPSCCs and whether they may serve as potential novel biomarkers
for increased potential of metastasis. Our studies revealed that HPV16-E6E7
expression leads to an increase in the number of stationary (CD44high /EpCAMhigh 
) stem cells in primary keratinocyte cultures. Most importantly, expression of
E6E7 in the cell line H357 increased the migratory (CD44high /EpCAMlow ) CSC
pool. This increase in migratory CSCs could also be confirmed in HPV+ OPSCC.
Differentially expressed miRNAs from HPV16-E6E7 positive CD44high /EpCAMlow CSCs 
were validated by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization on HPV16+ OPSCCs. These
experiments led to the identification of miR-3194-5p, which is upregulated in
primary HPV16+ OPSCC and matched metastasis. MiR-1281 was also found to be highly
expressed in HPV+ and HPV- metastasis. As inhibition of this miRNA led to a
markedly reduction of CD44high /EpCAMlow cells, it may prove to be a promising
drug target. Taken together, our findings highlight the capability of HPV16 to
modify the phenotype of infected stem cells and that miR-1281 and miR3194-5p may 
represent promising targets to block metastatic spread of OPSCC.
