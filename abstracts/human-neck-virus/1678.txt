BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE) has traditionally been regarded as a
disease of children. The age shift in JE patients in Assam, India in last few
years has become a cause of concern. Comparison on clinical features of adult and
pediatric JE patients has not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical features of adult and pediatric with JE virus
infection.
STUDY DESIGN: From January 2008 to January 2010, 550 hospitalized patients with
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome were enrolled. 259 (47.1%) were serologically
confirmed as JE of which 66.4% were adult and 33.6% were pediatric. Data
extracted from these patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fever was the most common symptom in both the adult and pediatric. When 
compared with adult, significantly higher percentage of pediatric had neck
rigidity, convulsions, abnormal behavior, seizures and elevated aspartate
transaminase (P<0.05). Serum bilirubin levels were higher in 2.3% of adult but
normal in all the pediatric. We found significantly higher mean elevated level of
protein and WBC in CSF in adult (P<0.001) and mean elevated aspartate
transaminase level (P<0.001) in pediatrics. There was no difference in mortality 
rate between pediatric and adult (8.2% vs. 4.4%, P=0.647).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some significant differences in clinical
features of pediatric and adult with JE. Age shift may be due to the invasion of 
the disease into new demography or some change in the virus strain over time. The
Government of India has initiated an adult JE vaccination programme for the first
time in Assam in 2011.
