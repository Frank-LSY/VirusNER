BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder resulting in a loss of
function of the Fanconi anemia-related DNA repair pathway. Individuals with
Fanconi anemia are predisposed to some cancers, including oropharyngeal and
gynecologic cancers, with known associations with human papillomavirus (HPV) in
the general population. As individuals with Fanconi anemia respond poorly to
chemotherapy and radiation, prevention of cancer is critical.
METHODS: To determine whether individuals with Fanconi anemia are particularly
susceptible to oral HPV infection, we analyzed survey-based risk factor data and 
tested DNA isolated from oral rinses from 126 individuals with Fanconi anemia and
162 unaffected first-degree family members for 37 HPV types.
RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (11.1%) with Fanconi anemia tested positive,
significantly more (P = 0.003) than family members (2.5%). While HPV prevalence
was even higher for sexually active individuals with Fanconi anemia (17.7% vs.
2.4% in family; P = 0.003), HPV positivity also tended to be higher in the
sexually inactive (8.7% in Fanconi anemia vs. 2.9% in siblings). Indeed, having
Fanconi anemia increased HPV positivity 4.9-fold (95% CI, 1.6-15.4) considering
age and sexual experience, but did not differ by other potential risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that oral HPV is more common in individuals with 
Fanconi anemia. It will be essential to continue to explore associations between 
risk factors and immune dysfunction on HPV incidence and persistence over time.
IMPACT: HPV vaccination should be emphasized in those with Fanconi anemia as a
first step to prevent oropharyngeal cancers, although additional studies are
needed to determine whether the level of protection it offers in this population 
is adequate.
