This study evaluates the suitability of Xpert HPV (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
test for cervical and tonsillar formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
samples as compared to the tests currently used in diagnostics. Cervical biopsies
and liquid cytology (LC) samples were collected from 48 women attending
colposcopy. Biopsies were processed for histology and tested for hrHPV using
Xpert HPV. LC samples were tested using Xpert and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany) tests. Also 29 archived tonsillar carcinoma samples were tested 
using Xpert, and the results were compared with histology and immunohistochemical
p16INK4a (p16) staining. Among valid cervical LC samples 46.8% were hrHPV
positive using Xpert test and 55.3% with HC2. The sensitivity of Xpert was 84.6% 
as compared to HC2, and overall test concordance was 91.5%. Test concordance
between valid Xpert results from biopsies and LC samples was 84.6%. Among valid
tonsillar samples 70.4% were hrHPV positive, and concordance of 96.3% was found
between Xpert and p16 staining. To conclude, Xpert HPV test cartridge provides a 
convenient platform to test individual samples, including FFPE samples. Further
studies are needed to establish whether test sensitivity is sufficient to
reliably differentiate between hrHPV positive and hrHPV negative head and neck
carcinomas.
