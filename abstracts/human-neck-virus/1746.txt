BACKGROUND: Several studies have documented disparities in head and neck cancer
outcomes for black patients in the United States. Recent studies have found that 
differences in oropharyngeal tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status may be a
cause of this disparity.
METHODS: In all, 76,817 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
recorded in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) program were analyzed. Racial/ethnic groups were studied, for
disease-specific survival in both case-matched and nonmatched cohorts.
Calculation of expected disparity magnitudes based on HPV status was performed
using data reported in the literature.
RESULTS: A disease-specific survival disparity was demonstrated for Hispanic
patients. However, case matching eliminated this disparity. Conversely, the
disparity for black patients persisted in matched cohorts. The oropharyngeal
subsite was found to be the dominant contributor to this disparity.
CONCLUSIONS: The survival disparity for Hispanic patients in SEER with HNSCC is
explained by differences in presentation and treatment. Also, HPV tumor status is
likely a key determinant of the disparity for black patients.
