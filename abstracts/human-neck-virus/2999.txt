Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the meninges that can be infected by
bacteria, virus, or fungus. The classic triad of bacterial meningitis consists of
fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status; headache is also another common
symptom. Interventions for bacterial meningitis include prompt diagnosis, and
initiation of antimicrobial therapy to optimize bacterial kill and decrease
inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space. Nursing management consists of
effective delivery of antibiotic therapy, fluid management, and supportive care.
