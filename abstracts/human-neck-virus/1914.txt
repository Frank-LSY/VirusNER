BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits high rates of 
recurrence, and with few approved targeted agents, novel treatments are needed.
We analyzed a molecular profiling database for the distribution of biomarkers
predictive of chemotherapies and targeted agents.
METHODS: Seven hundred thirty-five patients with advanced HNSCC (88 with known
human papillomavirus [HPV] status), were profiled using multiple platforms (gene 
sequencing, gene copy number, and protein expression).
RESULTS: Among the entire patient population studied, epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) was the protein most often overexpressed (90%), TP53 gene most
often mutated (41%), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) most often
amplified (40%; n = 5). With the exception of TP53 mutation, other biomarker
frequencies were not significantly different among HPV-positive or HPV-negative
patients. PIK3CA mutations and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss are
frequent events, independent of HPV status. The immune response-modulating
programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) axis was 
active across sites, stages, and HPV status.
CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling utilizing multiple platforms provides a range of 
therapy options beyond standard of care. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck
