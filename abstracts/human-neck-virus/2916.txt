Oral cancer is the most common head and neck cancer in Finland. The number of new
cases has been on a steady rise over the last decades. Smoking and heavy drinking
are the most important risk factors. The role of papilloma virus infection is
under active research, albeit with a smaller role than in oropharyngeal cancer,
for instance. Surgical excision of the tumor is usually the first-line treatment.
Pathoanatomical investigation of the primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes is
essential in evaluating the need of adjuvant therapy. The prognosis of oral
cancer has improved as a result of early detection and development of treatment
modalities.
