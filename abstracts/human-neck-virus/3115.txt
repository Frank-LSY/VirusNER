BACKGROUND: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare nonneoplastic histiocytic
proliferative disorder characterized by painless massive lymphadenopathy.
Extranodal manifestations frequently occur in the head and neck area.
METHODS: We report the clinical and histological features of nasal cavities and
cervical lymph node RDD in a 72-year-old woman, who complained of major nasal
obstruction and hyposmia.
RESULTS: Nasal endoscopy revealed polypoid masses arising from the turbinates;
the septum was intact. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed staining for S-100
protein, CD68, and alpha-1 antitrypsin. The presence of the Epstein-Barr virus
was revealed by serology and also by in situ hybridization. The general
examination and systemic evaluation did not find other extranodal localization.
CONCLUSION: Because the disease is known for not responding to local or systemic 
steroids, CO(2) laser excision was used to clear the nasal obstruction with a
satisfactory result. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description
of the use of laser excision for nasal cavities RDD.
