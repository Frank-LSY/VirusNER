Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) have been implicated
in topologically similar but diverse cellular and pathological processes
including multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis, cytokinesis and enveloped virus
budding. Although receptor sorting at the endosomal membrane producing MVBs
employs the regulated assembly of ESCRT-0 followed by ESCRT-I, -II, -III and the 
vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)4 complex, other ESCRT-catalyzed processes require 
only a subset of complexes which commonly includes ESCRT-III and VPS4. Recent
progress has shed light on the pathway of ESCRT assembly and highlights the
separation of tasks of different ESCRT complexes and associated partners. The
emerging picture suggests that among all ESCRT-catalyzed processes, divergent
pathways lead to ESCRT-III assembly within the neck of a budding structure
catalyzing membrane fission.
