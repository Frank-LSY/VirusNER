BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell cancer of the head
and neck (SCCHN) has emerged as a distinct clinical entity. The expression of p16
protein can be used as a surrogate for HPV status.
METHODS: p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was assessed in archival
paraffin-embedded material for 55 patients with locally advanced SCCHN treated
with a uniform regimen of cisplatin and radiation. HPV status was assessed by
colorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Compared with p16- and HPV-negative patients, the p16- and HPV-positive 
patients had improved overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional
recurrence rates.
CONCLUSIONS: p16 IHC may serve as a useful surrogate and prognostic marker for
patients with HPV-related SCCHN treated with cisplatin and radiation.
