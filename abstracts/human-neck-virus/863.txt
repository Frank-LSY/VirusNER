Persistent infection by a subgroup of so-called high-risk human papillomaviruses 
(HPVs) that have a tropism for mucosal epithelia has been defined as the cause of
more than 98% of cervical carcinomas as well as a high proportion of other
cancers of the anogenital region. Infection of squamous epithelial tissues in the
head and neck region by these same high-risk HPVs is also associated with a
subset of cancers. Despite the general conservation of genetic structure amongst 
all HPV types, infection by the low-risk types, whether in genital or head and
neck sites, carries a negligible risk of malignant progression, and infections
have a markedly different pathology. In this review, we will examine and discuss 
the interactions that the principal viral oncoproteins of the high-risk
mucosotrophic HPVs and their counterparts from the low-risk group make with
cellular target proteins, with a view to explaining the differences in their
respective pathology.
