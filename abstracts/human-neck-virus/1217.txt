BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) have a better prognosis than patients with
HPV-negative OPSCCs. Important factors contributing to this better prognosis are 
relatively low numbers of local/regional recurrences (LRRs) and second primary
tumors (SPTs) in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. These low numbers may be
explained in addition by the absence of a 'field cancerization' effect, which is 
a cause of LRRs and SPTs in patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. We aimed to detect 
a possible 'field effect' in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. As HPV is involved
in the early stage of carcinogenesis in OPSCCs, its presence is considered a
reliable marker for the detection of such a field effect. Therefore, the presence
of transcriptionally active HPV was analyzed in the mucosa surrounding
HPV-positive OPSCCs.
METHODS: We included 20 patients who were surgically treated for an HPV-positive 
OPSCC in the period 2000-2006. Of each patient, the formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor sample and all available resection margins were
collected. In total, 97 resection margins were investigated with an average of
five resection margins per tumor. All samples were analyzed for the presence of
tumor and the presence of transcriptionally active HPV by HPV16-E6-mRNA
detection.
RESULTS: All tumors were HPV16-E6-mRNA positive. HPV16-E6-mRNA could be detected 
in the resection margins that contained tumor (n = 6). All tumor-negative
resection margins (n = 91) scored negative for HPV16-E6-mRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, transcriptional active HPV could not be detected in
the mucosa surrounding an HPV-positive OPSCC, which suggests the absence of field
effect. This observation may explain the lower number of LRRs and SPTs in
HPV-positive patients.
