OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, prognosis and molecular
biological changes of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 61 TSCC cases treated from January 1999 to
December 2012. Demographic data and clinical charts, including histologic grade
of tumor, treatment and outcome of the patients, were reviewed.Human
papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA were detected using SPF10-DNA enzyme immunoassay and
LiPA genotyping method. Expressions of p16 and p53 proteins were examinated by
immunohistochemistry. Survival rate was calculated with SPSS 19.0 software using 
the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: There were 55 males and 6 females, with a median age of 57 years. Of the
61 TSCC, 21 were with well differentiation, 19 with moderate differentiation and 
21 with poor differentiation, including 7 patients at stage II, 10 at stage III
and 44 at stage IV. HPV-positive rate of TSCC was 29.5% (18/61) and high-risk
HPV-16 subtype accounted for 72.2% (13/18). The percentage of famel patients in
HPV-positive TSCC was higher than HPV-negative TSCC (22.2% vs 4.7%).HPV-positive 
TSCC was more common in non-smoking patients (50.0% vs 79.1%, χ(2) = 5, 155, P = 
0.023) and non-drinking patients (27.8% vs 51.2%, χ(2) = 4.346, P = 0.037).
HPV-positive TSCC mostly presented with high expression of p16 protein (88.9% vs 
16.3%, χ(2) = 28.481, P = 0.000), and low expression of p53 protein (72.7% vs
46.5%, χ(2) = 5.028, P = 0.025). The prognosis of patients with HPV-associated
TSCC was significantly better than non-HPV-associated TSCC, and The 3-year and
5-year overall survival rates of patients with HPV-positive TSCC were higher than
those of patients with HPV-negative TSCC (87.7% vs 49.5% and 78.9% vs 33.0%,
respectively).
CONCLUSION: HPV-associated TSCC had unique clinicopathological and molecular
biological features, showing better prognosis compared to HPV-negative TSCC.
