CONCLUSION: The increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs 
indicates that these pattern recognition receptors are involved in the
pathogenesis of cholesteatoma.
OBJECTIVE: Changes in expression of pattern recognition receptors may be
associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. We therefore
assessed the levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs
associated with innate immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma.
METHODS: Cholesteatoma specimens were collected from 23 patients diagnosed with
acquired cholesteatoma from August 2010 to July 2012. The posterior auricular
skin of each patient was used as control. The levels of expression of Dec-205,
Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA were assessed quantitatively using real-time
RT-PCR and correlated with sex, hearing level, the presence of bacteria, and the 
need for repeat surgery.
RESULTS: The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs
were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p < 0.05
each). However, mRNA abundance was not associated with patient sex, hearing
level, presence of bacteria or history of reoperation (p > 0.05 each).
