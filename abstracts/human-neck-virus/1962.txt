Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are treated with surgery,
radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, but survival from locally-advanced
disease remains poor, particularly in patients whose tumors are negative for
Human papillomavirus (HPV). Type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) is known to promote
tumorigenesis and resistance to cancer therapeutics. Here, we assessed IGF-1R
immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing 852 cores from 346 HNSCC
patients with primary tumors in the oropharynx (n = 231), larynx (85),
hypopharynx (28), oral cavity (2). Of these, 236 (68%) were HPV-negative, 110
(32%) positive. IGF-1R was detected in the cell membrane of 36% and cytoplasm of 
92% of HNSCCs; in 64 cases with matched normal tonsillar epithelium, IGF-1R was
overexpressed in the HNSCCs (P < 0.001). Overall survival (OS) and
disease-specific survival (DSS) were reduced in patients whose tumors contained
high membrane IGF-1R [OS: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.63, P = 0.006; DSS: HR = 1.63, P 
= 0.016], cytoplasmic IGF-1R (OS: HR = 1.58, P = 0.009; DSS: HR = 1.58, P =
0.024) and total IGF-1R (OS: HR = 2.02, P < 0.001; DSS: HR = 2.2, P < 0.001).
High tumor IGF-1R showed significant association with high-tumor T-stage (P <
0.001) and HPV-negativity (P < 0.001), and was associated with shorter OS when
considering patients with HPV-positive (P = 0.01) and negative (P = 0.006) tumors
separately. IGF-1R was independently associated with survival in multivariate
analysis including HPV, but not when lymphovascular invasion, perineural spread
and T-stage were included. Of these factors, only IGF-1R can be manipulated; the 
association of IGF-1R with aggressive disease supports experimental incorporation
of anti-IGF-1R agents into multimodality treatment programs for HPV-negative and 
high IGF-1R HPV-positive HNSCC.
