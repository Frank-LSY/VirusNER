BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of HPV vaccines, the incidence of
HPV-related cancers (cervical, penile, anal, vulvar, vagina, head, and neck) in
sub-Saharan Africa has been rising. The increasing incidence of these HPV-related
cancers has been attributed to changes in lifestyle-related risk factors, most
notably sexual behavior. The main objective of this study is to map evidence on
the distribution of HIV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review to explore, describe, and 
map literature on the distribution of HPV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The primary search will include peer-reviewed and review articles. The list of
references from included studies will also be searched. The search will be
performed using EBSCOhost platform by searching the following databases within
the platform: Academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, 
CINAHL with full text, PubMed, Science Direct, Google scholar and World Health
Organization (WHO) library databases, and gray literature. The researcher will
search the articles using keywords, from the included studies; abstract and full 
articles will be screened by two independent reviewers. The screening will be
guided by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic content analysis will 
be used to present the narrative account of the reviews, using NVivo version 10.
DISCUSSION: We anticipate finding relevant literature on the distribution of
HPV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa. The study findings will help reveal
research gaps to guide future research.
