OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To describe initial presentations and idiosyncrasies in
establishing the diagnosis for human papillomavirus-related (HPV(+) ) compared to
HPV-unrelated (HPV(-) ) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC).
STUDY DESIGN: A single institution retrospective series derived from an
institutional prospectively compiled database supplemented by chart review.
METHODS: We reviewed consecutive OPC patients referred to an academic tertiary
cancer center from 2009 to 2011. HPV status was evaluated by p16 staining.
Signs/symptoms and procedures to establish diagnosis were recorded independently 
by two abstractors blinded to the HPV status during data retrieval. Initial
presentations (signs/symptoms), interval, and the procedures to establish the
diagnosis were compared between HPV(+) and HPV(-) OPC.
RESULTS: The most common initial presentation was an asymptomatic nodal mass for 
HPV(+) patients (n = 208; 69% vs. 29%, P < .001) in contrast to
dysphagia/odynophagia for HPV(-) (n = 96; 34% vs. 63%, P < .001). Protracted
interval (>12 months) from onset of signs/symptoms to diagnosis was observed in
18 (9%) HPV(+) versus three (3%) HPV(-) patients (P = .058). More HPV(+) patients
required repeated (≥2) biopsy procedures (56% vs. 10%, P < .001). Misattribution 
to other disease occurred in eight (4%) HPV(+) patients (seven were mistaken as
having a "branchial cleft cyst" when there were cystic lymph nodes and one as
having a "lymphoma") compared to none in HPV(-) .
CONCLUSIONS: About two-thirds of HPV(+) patients present with an asymptomatic
neck mass and often require multiple biopsy procedures to establish the
diagnosis. Idiosyncrasies in appreciating the diagnostic setting (cystic lymph
node, misattribution to other entities, or submucosal location of the tumor) or
patient-related factors could delay the diagnosis of HPV(+) OPC.
