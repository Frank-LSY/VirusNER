Mollaret meningitis is a syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of meningitis 
that occur over a period of several years in an affected patient. Also known as
recurrent lymphocytic meningitis, this entity involves repeated episodes of
headache, stiff neck, fever, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Herpes simplex 
virus type 2 is the most frequently implicated causative agent, and treatment
involves the use of antiviral medications. We describe a case of Mollaret
meningitis in a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with
his eighth episode of meningitis during a period of 20 years. Cerebrospinal fluid
polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 was positive,
and further testing excluded other common viral, bacterial, and inflammatory
causes of meningeal irritation. The patient's family history was significant for 
a brother who also had multiple episodes of aseptic meningitis during a period of
several years. This represents the first published report of a possible familial 
association involving Mollaret meningitis. It is likely that Mollaret meningitis 
is underrecognized among emergency physicians, and improved recognition of this
entity may limit unwarranted antibiotic use and shorten or eliminate unnecessary 
hospital admission.
