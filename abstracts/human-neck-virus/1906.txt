IMPORTANCE: Survival of patients with head and neck cancer can be affected by
competing causes of mortality, as well as comorbidities that result in radiation 
treatment interruptions.
OBJECTIVE: To discern how differences in preexisting medical and psychosocial
comorbidities potentially influence adherence to radiation therapy according to
human papillomavirus (HPV) status.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis at a comprehensive
cancer center of 162 consecutive patients with locally advanced squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx treated with primary chemoradiation (n = 95) or
primary surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (n = 67). Immunostaining for p16
was used to determine HPV status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use was
compared between patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors, as well as
the prevalence of the following comorbidities: diabetes mellitus, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anxiety disorder, and major depression. The
number of total missed treatment days was analyzed as both a continuous and
categorical variable.
RESULTS: Rates of self-reported heavy alcohol use (47% vs 16%; P = .02) and any
marijuana use (47% vs 23%; P = .003) were significantly higher among HPV-negative
patients. Fifty-four percent of HPV-positive patients self-identified as never
smokers, compared with only 12% of HPV-negative patients (P < .001). HPV-negative
patients had more missed treatment days (mean, 2.8 vs 1.7 days; P = .02), as well
as an increased rate of at least 5 missed days (24% vs 10%; P = .04), and higher 
prevalences of COPD (12% vs 7%; P = .37) and anxiety disorder (12% vs 6%;
P = .35).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pronounced differences exist in lifestyle habits
between patients with HPV-negative and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer at
diagnosis. These differences, as well as those of medical and psychosocial
burden, may contribute to observed discrepancies in treatment adherence and need 
to be considered in outcomes reporting and clinical trial design.
