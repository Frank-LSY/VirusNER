A 66-year-old woman complained of fever, sore throat, and neck pain due to
pharyngitis and painful lymph node swelling. CBC revealed severe pancytopenia and
markedly hypocellular marrow. The administration of antibiotics and
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) successfully ameliorated the
inflammatory lesions, and hematopoiesis recovered. Causes for pancytopnenia was
unlikely to be virus infection or drugs, and aplastic anemia was also unlikely
since only the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was
markedly elevated, erythropoietin (EPO) was slightly elevated, interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma) was normal, and flow cytometric analysis for paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells was negative. These results suggested that the
cause of impaired hematopoiesis in the present patient might have been due to
elevated TNF-alpha in overwhelming infection, although the pathogen was not
identified.
