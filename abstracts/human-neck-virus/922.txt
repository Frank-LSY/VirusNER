OBJECTIVES: To describe an individual with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis
that extended into the lung parenchyma and underwent malignant transformation and
to discuss the characteristic imaging findings associated with this condition.
METHODS: The clinical presentation of an individual with this unusual malignant
transformation was reviewed. A literature search was performed to characterize
the epidemiology, imaging findings and management of this condition.
RESULTS: The patient underwent 30 courses of surgery over 21 years and presented 
disseminated pulmonary papilloma after childbirth. The interval between
dissemination into the lung and malignant transformation was 2.5 years. The
tracheal papilloma was positive for type 6 of human papilloma virus (HPV-6). She 
died because she refused further treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinician should have a high index of suspicion for lung
papillomatosis in patients with a tracheotomy. Appropriate diagnostic imaging
studies will be helpful in reaching this diagnosis and determining whether a
malignancy exists. Treatment options have limited success when lung
papillomatosis becomes malignant.
