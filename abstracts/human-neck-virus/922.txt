Scleredema adultorum is a rare condition characterised by progressive collagen and mucin deposition in the skin. While the aetiology has not been clearly delineated, the condition is often associated with common infections. The current report describes a previously healthy 16-year-old boy who presented with 3 weeks of progressive neck swelling and skin induration. He had evidence of both active streptococcal and Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of scleredema. The patient was treated for his streptococcal infection, but otherwise managed conservatively. Clear improvement in the signs and symptoms was seen at a 3-month follow-up appointment. Scleredema can be a complication of streptococcal infection but to our knowledge has not been reported in association with EBV. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with cutaneous/subcutaneous induration and swelling of the face and/or neck.
