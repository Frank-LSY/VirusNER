MicroRNA-10b (miR-10b) has been reported to facilitate the metastasis of breast
cancer. However, little is known about the role of miR-10b in the metastasis of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show that high levels of miR-10b
expression in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive latent membrane protein-1
(LMP1)-expressing NPC cells, and its expression is down-regulated by silencing
LMP1 or Twist. Induction of miR-10b over-expression in LMP1-silent C666-1 cells
promoted significant wound healing and transmembrane invasiveness in vitro. More 
importantly, miR-10b over-expression promoted the metastasis of NPC and
accelerated the death of tumor-bearing nude mice. These findings strongly suggest
that miR-10b positively regulates the metastasis of NPC.
