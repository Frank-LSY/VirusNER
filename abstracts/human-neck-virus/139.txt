BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) are the cause of most
ano-genital cancers and a fast growing subset of oropharyngeal cancer. As these
malignancies occur as a result of an HPV- infection transmitted through intimate 
contact, many patients with HPV- induced cancer and their partners are concerned 
about HPV-transmission and the potential partners' cancer risk. Few studies have 
addressed this issue and whether the HPV-related cancer risk of partners of
patients with HPV-related cancers is comparable to or greater than that of the
general population.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the published literature addressing 
this issue. Out of 1055 references screened, 53 articles were found eligible for 
inclusion.
RESULTS: Regarding the issue of coincidence of HPV-induced oropharyngeal and/or
anogenital cancers in couples, 13 case-reports or case-series were reported and 9
larger studies based on population-registries. Four of these registry studies
showed an increased risk of cervical cancer in the partner while four did not.
Among the four positive studies, odds ratios for the development of HPV-related
cancer among spouses were between 2.6 and 6.7. One study showed an increased risk
of tongue or tonsil cancer among husbands of women with cervical dysplasia or
cancer. Overall the absolute risk increase in all these studies was small, on the
order of 1-3%, although potentially underestimated. Indeed, all these studies
have assessed partner's cancer risk at only one anatomical site whereas HPV-
related malignancies can affect different locations.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests a small trend of increase risk in
HPV-associated cancers among spouses of patients with HPV-related cancer.
