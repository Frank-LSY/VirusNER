Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an EBV-associated malignant tumor of
nasopharynx. As extremely rare condition, the second primary cancer of
nasopharynx can occur in NPC patients synchronously or subsequently.
Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a rare tumor and commonly originates in the 
head and neck region. However, there is no report to describe a collision tumor
of NPC and EMP occurring in the same nasopharyngeal mass. We report here an
unusual case of synchronous coexistence of NPC and EMP occurring in the
nasopharynx of an old male patient. A 63-year-old male patient presented with a
3-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction and recently intermittent
epistaxis without enlargement of cervical lymph nodes. The solitary mass of
nasopharynx was found by radiological and nasopharyngeal examination.
Histologically, the mass contained two separated portions and displayed typically
histological features of NPC and EMP, respectively. In EMP portion, the tumor was
composed of monomorphic plasmacytoid-appearing cells with immuno-positive to
CD79a, CD138, CD38, MUM-1 and CD56, but lack immunoreactivity to pan-CK
(AE1/AE3), CD20, CD21 and EBERs. In NPC portion, the tumor cells formed
irregular-shaped islands with diffusely immuno-positive to pan-CK (AE1/AE3), EMA 
and EBERs, but lack expressions of lymphoplasmacytic markers. A diagnosis of
simultaneous occurrence of EMP and NPC in nasopharynx was made. There was no
evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis 18-month follow-up after radiotherapy.
To our knowledge, it may be the first case of coexistence of EMP and NPC
synchronously. In addition, the histological differential diagnosis and relevant 
potential mechanism of this unusual collision tumor were also discussed.
