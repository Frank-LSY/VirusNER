Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a special type of treatment involving the use of a 
photosensitizer or a photosensitizing agent along with a special type of light,
which, combined together, induces production of a form of oxygen that is used to 
kill surrounding cells in different areas of the human body. Specification of the
head and neck region requires different approaches due to the surrounding of
vital structures. PDT can also be used to treat cells invaded with infections
such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. The light beam placed in tumor sites
activates locally applied drugs and kills the cancer cells. Many studies are
taking place in order to invent better photosensitizers, working on a larger
scale and to treat deeply placed and larger tumors. It seems that PDT could be
used as an alternative surgical treatment in some tumor types; however, all
clinicians should be aware that the surgical approach is still the treatment of
choice. PDT is a very accurate and effective therapy, especially in early stages 
of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and can greatly affect
surgical outcomes in cancerous patients. We present a detailed review about
photosensitizers, their use, and therapeutic advantages and disadvantages.
