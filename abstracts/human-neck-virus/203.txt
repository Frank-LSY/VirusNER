An attenuated vaccinia virus-MVTTEAB-was constructed by deletion of non-essential
gene segments related to the immunomodulatory and virulence functions of the
vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (VVTT). The shuttle plasmids pTC-EGFP, pTE-EGFP,
pTA35-EGFP, pTB-EGFP, and pTA66-EGFP were constructed and combined with the early
and late strong promoter pE/L and EGFP as an exogenous selectable marker. Then,
through the homologous recombination technology and Cre/loxP system, the
following gene fragments were gradually knocked out one by one: TC7L-TK2L, TE3L, 
TA35R, TB13R, and TA66R. Ultimately, the five-segment-deleted attenuated strain
MVTTEAB was obtained. Knockout of these segments and genetic stability of MVTTEAB
were confirmed, and it was also shown that knockout of these segments did not
affect the replication ability of the virus. Further, a series of in vivo and in 
vitro experiments demonstrated that the virulence of MVTTEAB was attenuated
significantly, but at same time, high immunogenicity was maintained. These
results indicate that MVTTEAB has potential for clinical use as a safe viral
vector or vaccine with good attenuation and immunogenicity.
