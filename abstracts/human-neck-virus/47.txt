PURPOSE: The genetic differences between human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive and
-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) remain largely unknown. 
To identify differential biology and novel therapeutic targets for both entities,
we determined mutations and copy-number aberrations in a large cohort of
locoregionally advanced HNSCC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed massively parallel sequencing of 617
cancer-associated genes in 120 matched tumor/normal samples (42.5% HPV-positive).
Mutations and copy-number aberrations were determined and results validated with 
a secondary method.
RESULTS: The overall mutational burden in HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC was
similar with an average of 15.2 versus 14.4 somatic exonic mutations in the
targeted cancer-associated genes. HPV-negative tumors showed a mutational
spectrum concordant with published lung squamous cell carcinoma analyses with
enrichment for mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, MLL2, CUL3, NSD1, PIK3CA, and NOTCH
genes. HPV-positive tumors showed unique mutations in DDX3X, FGFR2/3 and
aberrations in PIK3CA, KRAS, MLL2/3, and NOTCH1 were enriched in HPV-positive
tumors. Currently targetable genomic alterations were identified in FGFR1, DDR2, 
EGFR, FGFR2/3, EPHA2, and PIK3CA. EGFR, CCND1, and FGFR1 amplifications occurred 
in HPV-negative tumors, whereas 17.6% of HPV-positive tumors harbored mutations
in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (FGFR2/3), including six recurrent
FGFR3 S249C mutations. HPV-positive tumors showed a 5.8% incidence of KRAS
mutations, and DNA-repair gene aberrations, including 7.8% BRCA1/2 mutations,
were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutational makeup of HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC differs
significantly, including targetable genes. HNSCC harbors multiple therapeutically
important genetic aberrations, including frequent aberrations in the FGFR and
PI3K pathway genes. See related commentary by Krigsfeld and Chung, p. 495.
