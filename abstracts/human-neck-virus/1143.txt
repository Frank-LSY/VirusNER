BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is the most common
benign neoplasm of the larynx in children. Intralesional injection of cidofovir
may have some potential as an adjunctive treatment. There is no standardised
protocol in the UK for the management of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
This study aimed to investigate the management practices of surgeons treating
paediatric recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in the UK.
METHOD: A web questionnaire survey was sent by e-mail to all members of the
British Association of Paediatric Otorhinolaryngology.
RESULTS: Out of 35 respondents, 23 were at that time treating children with
recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Nineteen respondents preferred to use a
microdebrider, 12 preferred laser, and 5 preferred cold steel along with either
laser or a microdebrider. Twelve surgeons used cidofovir for selected patients
and 12 surgeons did not use cidofovir for any patients. Cidofovir was considered 
after 0–4 surgical procedures by seven respondents, after 4–6 surgical procedures
by four respondents and after 6 surgical procedures by six respondents. Eleven
respondents warned patients about the possible side effects of cidofovir and five
gave no warning.
CONCLUSION: There was no consensus as to when it would be appropriate to use
cidofovir, indicating the need for cidofovir usage guidelines.
