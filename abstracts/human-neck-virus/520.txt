BACKGROUND: Severe late dysphagia is common after chemoradiotherapy for cancers
of the larynx and oropharynx. Options for reduction of severe late dysphagia are 
limited for human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative patients. In this study, the role
of feeding tube choice in severe late dysphagia is investigated.
METHODS: Patients disease-free after chemoradiotherapy for HPV-negative cancers
of the laryngopharynx who received a feeding tube on-treatment were identified.
The incidence of severe late dysphagia after reactive nasogastric (R-NG),
proactive or reactive percutaneous gastrostomy (P-PEG or R-PEG) was assessed
using log-rank and Cox analyses.
RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients received a feeding tube on-treatment and remained
disease-free. Median follow-up was 64 months. The 5-year incidence of severe late
dysphagia was 30.8% in the R-NG cohort (n = 36), 56.4% in the R-PEG (n = 17; p = 
.193), and 60.9% in the P-PEG (n = 25; p = .016) cohorts. On multivariate
analysis, percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) feeding was independently associated
with an increased rate of severe late dysphagia.
CONCLUSION: R-NG use during chemoradiotherapy is associated with less severe late
dysphagia and is preferred over PEG. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:
