BACKGROUND: One of the malignant tumors among head and neck cancers is
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Many studies consider human papilloma virus (HPV) as a 
cause for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: 41 paraffin-wax-embedded block samples were examined to detect HPV DNA
and its subtype's presence by polymerase chain reaction. The recurrence,
prognosis and survival were evaluated for an average of 48 months.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was positive in 9 patients (22%). The overall recurrence rate
was 75% in HPV negative patients and 11% in HPV positive ones. The mortality rate
in HPV negative and positive patients was 37.5% and 0%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: HPV type 18 and 16 were the most common subtypes. Also, it can be
implied that patients which are HPV positive had better prognosis and also less
recurrence.
