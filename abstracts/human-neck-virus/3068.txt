Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often develop methotrexate-associated
lymphoproliferative disorders (MTX-LPD) during MTX treatment. MTX-LPD
occasionally regresses spontaneously after simply discontinuing MTX treatment. In
patients without spontaneous regression, additional chemotherapy is required to
avoid disease progression. However, the differences between spontaneous and
non-spontaneous regression have yet to be elucidated. To clarify the factors
important for spontaneous regression, we analyzed the clinicopathological
features of 51 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developed MTX-LPD (diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]-type [n = 34] and classical Hodgkin lymphoma
[CHL]-type [n = 17]). We examined the interval from MTX discontinuation to the
administration of additional chemotherapy. The majority of DLBCL-type MTX-LPD
patients (81%) exhibited remission with MTX discontinuation alone. In contrast,
the majority of CHL-type MTX-LPD patients (76%) required additional chemotherapy.
This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). However, overall
survival was not significantly different between DLBCL-type and CHL-type (91% vs 
94%, respectively; P > 0.05). Thus, the morphological differences in the
pathological findings of MTX-LPD may be a factor for spontaneous or
non-spontaneous regression after discontinuation of MTX.
