The epithelium is part of an integrated immune system where cytokines, toll-like 
receptors and their ligands, and extracellular vesicles play a crucial role in
initiating an innate immune response. IL-36γ is a pro-inflammatory member of the 
IL-1 family that is mainly expressed by epithelial cells, but regulation of its
expression and release are only beginning to be understood. Previous studies
reported that IL-36γ is abundant in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a rare 
but devastating disease caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 6 and 11, in
which papillomas recurrently grow in and block the airway. Despite the
overexpression of IL-36γ, papilloma tissues show no evidence of inflammation,
possibly due to suppression of its release by HPVs. We have used primary human
foreskin keratinocytes as a model to study IL-36γ regulation in normal epithelial
cells. Low doses of poly(I:C) mediate expression and release of IL-36γ without
inducing the cell death reported by those using high doses. PKR, an enzyme
required for inflammasome activation, does not contribute to controlled release
of IL36γ. The keratinocytes secrete IL-36γ in two forms, soluble and in
extracellular vesicles. We conclude that there are two separately regulated
pathways for the controlled secretion of IL-36γ from keratinocytes, which could
contribute to the modulation of both local and systemic immune responses to
viruses and other pathogens.
