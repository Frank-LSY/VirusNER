Hepatic involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL)is common, but rarely
presents with liver injury. We report a case of chronic hepatitis C(CH-C)in a
patient who had suffered from liver injury as a result of hepatic involvement by 
CLL. A 74-year-old man was hospitalized because of an examination confirming him 
positive for leukocytosis. Computer tomography scan showed mild
hepatosplenomegaly, lymph node swelling of the neck and axilla, and abdominal
lymphadenopathy. He was diagnosed as CLL by bone marrow examination. His
laboratory data revealed hepatis C virus(HCV)antibody-positive, and elevated
levels of both aminotransferase and HCV-RNA. Liver biopsy demonstrated
significant CLL involvement of portal areas and a mild T lymphocyte invasion of
centrilobular and portal areas. After treatment with polyethylene glycol
interferon (PEG-IFN)-α-2b for CH-C, the CLL count was decreased in both
peripheral blood and the liver. The hematological response was significantly
correlated with the disappearance of HCV-RNA. The patient has maintained a
sustained virological response(SVR)status for the past 9 months after
PEG-IFN-α-2b administration. Thus, PEG-IFN-α-2b therapy could be effective not
only for CH-C but also for hepatic involvement of CLL as seen in our patient.
