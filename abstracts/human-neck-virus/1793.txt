INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate if defective repair of DNA
double-strand break (DSB) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) could 
be used as an early predictor of treatment response.
METHODS: Tumour biopsy 24-36 h following induction chemotherapy (IC) and
pre-treatment biopsies were stained for RAD51 and geminin (S-phase marker) for
immunofluorescence in patients with HNSCC. The difference between RAD51 score
(percentage of geminin-positive cells that were also positive for RAD51) was
calculated for the two specimens. Tumours with a percentage difference of⩽10%
were deemed to have repaired IC-induced DSBs, and were classified as 'RAD51
negative'. Response at 3 months post treatment and human papilloma virus (HPV)
status were assessed.
RESULTS: Thirteen pairs of samples were available for analyses. Three samples
were classified as RAD51 negative and 10 as RAD51 positive at 24 h post IC. All
of the three patients with tumours classified as RAD51 negative had partial
response or progressive disease and the 10 patients with tumours deemed RAD51
positive had a complete response. 100% of the HPV-positive tumours were RAD51
positive and had a complete response.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that impaired DSB DNA repair may underlie
enhanced treatment sensitivity of HPV-positive HNSCC and repair capacity
following platinum-induced DNA damage predicts response in HNSCC. This has
potential as a biomarker for patient selection in trials of DNA damage response
pathway modulation.
