Oral cavity and in particular oral tongue cancers occur with a rising incidence in younger patients often lacking the typical risk factors of tobacco use, alcohol use, and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Their prognosis when treated with chemoradiation has not been well studied and responsible risk factors remain elusive. A viral etiology (other than HPV) has been hypothesized.
