The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+ OPC) is increasing, thus
presenting new challenges for disease detection and management. Noninvasive
methods involving brush biopsies of diseased tissues were recently reported as
insufficient for tumor detection in HPV+ OPC patients, likely due to differences 
between the site of tumor initiation at the base of involuted crypts and the site
of brush biopsy at the crypt surface. We hypothesized that histologically normal 
surface epithelial cells in the oropharynx contain changes in nuclear morphology 
that arise due to tumor proximity. We analyzed the nuclear phenotype of matched
tumor, tumor-adjacent normal, and contralateral normal tissues from biopsies of
nine HPV+ OPC patients. Measurements of 89 nuclear features were used to train a 
random forest-based classifier to discriminate between normal and tumor nuclei.
We then extracted voting scores from the trained classifier, which classify
nuclei on a continuous scale from zero ("normal-like") to one ("tumor-like"). In 
each case, the average score of the adjacent normal nuclei was intermediate
between the tumor and contralateral normal nuclei. These results provide evidence
for the existence of phenotypic changes in histologically normal, tumor-adjacent 
surface epithelial cells, which could be used as brush biopsy-based biomarkers
for HPV+ OPC detection.
