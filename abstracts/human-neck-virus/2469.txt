OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the pattern of
telomere length and telomerase expression in cancer tissues and the surrounding
mucosa (SM), as markers of field cancerization and clinical outcome in patients
successfully treated for with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This investigation was a prospective cohort study.
Telomere length and levels of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) transcripts
were quantified by real-time PCR in cancer tissues and SM from 139 and 90
patients with HNSCC, respectively.
RESULTS: No correlation was found between age and telomere length in SM. Patients
with short telomeres in SM had a higher risk of mucosal failure (adjusted
HR=4.29). Patients with high TERT levels in cancer tissues had a higher risk of
regional failure (HR=2.88), distant failure (HR=7.27), worse disease-specific
survival (HR for related death=2.62) but not mucosal failure. High-risk patients 
having both short telomeres in SM and high levels of TERT in cancer showed a
significantly lower overall survival (HR=2.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall these findings suggest that telomere shortening in SM is a
marker of field cancerization and may precede reactivation of TERT. Short
telomeres in SM are strongly prognostic of mucosal failure, whereas TERT levels
in cancer tissues increase with the aggressiveness of the disease and are
prognostic of tumor spread.
