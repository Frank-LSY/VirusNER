The majority of cold and flulike illnesses are caused by human rhinoviruses
(HRVs). Improved detection of HRV has shown that HRVs are also associated with
more serious illness, such as exacerbation of asthma, wheezing illnesses in
children, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiopulmonary disease, and
fatal pneumonia in immune-compromised patients. HRV is a major cause of acute
viral respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children and is among the
leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide. Detection of the HRV genome by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and genomic sequencing has
brought to light a new clade, HRV-C, to the already recognized HRV-A and HRV-B
clades. The clinical complications related to all rhinovirus infections include
acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and acute bronchitis. The enormous public
health implications from those diseases far overshadow those of the common cold. 
This article provides an overview of the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection in 
the upper airways. Most research has been done in young healthy adults with
self-limiting experimental and natural rhinovirus infections, and this may set
the stage for understanding rhinovirus infections in the ear, sinus, and lower
airways.
