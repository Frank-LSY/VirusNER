To analyze the medical literature devoted to work-up, epidemiology, local
control, survival, complications and sequelae after conservative treatment for
early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsillar region. An analysis of the
PubMed (1975-2016) database was performed using the following keywords and
associations: "tonsil/tonsillar region/oropharynx" AND "squamous cell carcinoma" 
AND "early-stage (I-II; T1-2N0M0)" AND "radiation therapy/radiotherapy" OR
"conservative surgery/oropharyngectomy/transoral surgery/radical tonsillectomy". 
The search retrieved 10 retrospective series documenting local control and/or
survival in series with more than 50 cases and a minimum 2 years' follow-up after
conservative treatment; no prospective studies, meta-analyses and/or Cochrane
analyses were found. Magnetic resonance imaging is the key radiological exam for 
local extension assessment. Human papilloma virus infection (HPV) is a risk
factor that must be screened for systematically, since it induces tumoral
radio-sensitivity and increases the risk of specific synchronous and metachronous
second primaries. Whatever conservative treatment used, local control and
survival rates higher than 85% were achieved. Implementing intensity-modulated
radiation therapy reduced the incidence and severity of radiation-related
complications and sequelae. Transoral surgery yielded very low
morbidity/mortality rates, enabled association to ipsilateral neck dissection,
and allowed radiation therapy to be reserved for the management of metachronous
second primaries. Transoral surgery appeared to be the first-line option in the
majority of cases. Lifetime follow-up adapted to HPV status is mandatory. The
development of HPV vaccination does not mean that campaigns against smoking and
alcohol abuse are of diminished importance.
