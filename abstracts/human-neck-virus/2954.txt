BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and microemboli (CTM) are attracting
increasing attention in medical biology and clinical practice. However, the
clinical relevance of CTCs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not yet been
ascertained, and no study has focused on the influence of Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) status on CTCs in NPC patients. These issues were therefore examined.
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were prospectively obtained from 33 NPC
patients before treatment. CTCs and CTM were captured using the Isolation by Size
of Epithelial Tumor (ISET) method. Immunohistochemistry on CK5/6 (cytokeratin5/6)
and P63, as well as in situ hybridization of EBERs (EBV-encoded RNAs) were used
to validate the harvested tumor cells.
RESULTS: Out of 33 NPC patients, CTCs were detected in 22 cases (66.7%), and CTM 
were observed in 2 cases (6.1%). CTCs were presented in all stages of NPC
patients but had no association with the TNM stages (all P > 0.05). The presence 
of CTCs appeared to correlate with EBV activation status. Among the total NPC
patients, the EBV VCA-IgA levels in CTC-positive cases were higher than that in
CTC-negative cases (negative vs. positive: 3.88 vs. 4.86, P = 0.016). A similar
result was observed in the patients without distant metastasis (negative vs.
positive: 3.76 vs. 4.95, P = 0.009). When the number of CTCs was considered, CTC 
counts were found to correlate with EBV VCA-IgA (R = 0.382, P = 0.041) and EBV
DNA load (R = 0.396, P = 0.033) for all NPC patients as well as NPC patients
without distant metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly suggested detectable CTCs/CTM in all stages 
of NPC patients and support a positive correlation between CTCs and EBV
activation in NPC patients.
