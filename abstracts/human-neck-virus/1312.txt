PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to play a role in the development of
head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and to date, no study has reported
on the association between oral HPV infection and HNSCC in the Caribbean. The
objective was to determine the prevalence of oral HPV infection in the French
West Indies (FWI), overall and by HPV genotype, among HNSCC cases and healthy
population controls.
METHOD: We used data from a population-based case-control study conducted in the 
FWI. The prevalence of oral HPV was estimated separately among 100 HNSCC cases
(mean age 59 years) and 308 population controls (mean age 57 years). Odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a logistic regression
adjusting for age, sex, tobacco, and alcohol consumption, to assess the
association between oral HPV infection and HNSCC.
RESULTS: Prevalence of oral HPV infections was 26% in controls (30% in men and
14% in women) and 36% in HNSCC cases (36% in men, 33% in women). HPV52 was the
most commonly detected genotype, in cases and in controls. The prevalence of
HPV16, HPV33, and HPV51 was significantly higher in cases than in controls
(p = 0.0340, p = 0.0472, and 0.0144, respectively). Oral infection with high-risk
HPV was associated with an increase in risk of HNSCC (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.95-4.15).
HPV16 was only associated with oropharyngeal cancer (OR 16.01, 95% CI
1.67-153.64).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of oral HPV infection in this
middle-aged Afro-Caribbean population, and a specific distribution of HPV
genotypes. These findings may provide insight into HNSCC etiology specific to the
FWI.
