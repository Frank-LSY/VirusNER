BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy is a
syndrome that occurs primarily in individuals who are being treated with highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
OBSERVATIONS: We describe 3 patients with an 8- to 15-year history of HIV disease
and HAART who presented a unique feature of HIV lipodystrophy, the "bullfrog
neck." In addition to their features of facial lipoatrophy and "buffalo hump,"
patients had the unique feature of circumferential enlargement of the neck. All
patients were undergoing treatment with the same non-nucleoside
reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) medication, efavirenz.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel finding of the bullfrog neck in 3 patients with
classic features of HIV lipodystrophy. The dysmorphic features of HIV
lipodystrophy present a significant therapeutic challenge because the current
repertoire of treatments is only modestly effective, and the disease in patients 
who continue HAART regimens over the long term will progress. Review of the
recent literature suggests that the individual protease inhibitors and NRTIs used
may play a role in the development and progression of HIV lipodystrophy.
