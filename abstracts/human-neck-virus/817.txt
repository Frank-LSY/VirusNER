OBJECTIVE: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are changing dramatically the
epidemiologic landscape of head and neck cancers (HNCs). Their role in the
aetiology of these cancers varies widely among HNCs subsites, sex and
geographical regions worldwide. We describe HPV prevalence and its association
with HNCs risk overall and by anatomical subsite in a sample of Canadians.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HeNCe Life study recruited 460 incident HNCs cases and
458 controls frequency-matched by age and sex from four Montreal hospitals in
2005-2013. We tested oral rinse and oral brush specimens for mucosal HPV
genotypes. HPV positivity was categorized hierarchically as either negative,
exclusively non-α-9 species types, α-9 types other than HPV16, and HPV16. We
estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations
between HPV and HNCs using unconditional logistic regression, controlling for
confounders.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HPV infection among controls and cases was 14.5% and
41.2% in oral rinse and 3.1% and 24.4% in oral brush samples, respectively. HPV16
was the predominant genotype with an oral rinse and oral brush prevalence of
26.3% and 16.2% among cases and 2.4% and 0.2% among controls, respectively. HPV
infection was associated with an increased risk of HNCs overall (OR=4.18; 95% CI,
2.94-5.95) and oropharyngeal cancer only (OR=10.3; 95% CI, 6.8-15.7). HNCs and
oropharyngeal cancer were strongly associated with HPV16 (OR=18.1; 95% CI,
9.1-35.8, and OR=47.2; 95% CI, 23.1-96.6, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HPV infection, particularly HPV16, was associated with an increased
HNCs risk, most strongly for oropharyngeal cancers.
