OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Parotid gland calcifications can be incidental findings on
computed tomography (CT) and have been reported to be associated with chronic
inflammatory conditions. Associations between parotid gland calcification and
other common medical conditions have not been reported.
METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, 1,571 patients who
underwent noncontrast head CT with 1.25-mm slice thickness on a 64-detector row
CT between January 2011 and July 2011 were retrospectively reviewed for parotid
gland calcifications. Medical records were reviewed for chronic kidney disease,
alcoholism, autoimmune conditions, endocrine disorders, elevated alkaline
phosphatase, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) status. Statistical analyses 
were performed using Fisher's exact test and multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Sixty-three of 1,571 (4%) patients had parotid gland calcifications.
Significant associations were observed between parotid gland calcifications and
HIV infection (P = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (P < 0.0001), alcoholism
(P < 0.0001), elevated alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.003), and autoimmune disease
(P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Parotid gland calcifications were associated with HIV, alcoholism,
chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.
