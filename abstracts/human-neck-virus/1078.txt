Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus that is highly
prevalent in almost all human populations and is associated with many human
cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin's disease, and gastric
carcinoma. However, in these EBV-associated cancers, only NPC exhibits remarkable
ethnic and geographic distribution. We hypothesized that EBV genomic variations
might contribute to the pathogenesis of different human cancers in different
geographic areas. In this study, we collected 18 NPC biopsy specimens from the
Hunan Province in southern China and de novo assembled 18 NPC biopsy
specimen-derived EBV (NPC-EBV) genomes, designated HN1 to HN18. This was achieved
through target enrichment of EBV DNA by hybridization, followed by
next-generation sequencing, to reveal sequence diversity. These EBV genomes
harbored 20,570 variations totally, including 20,328 substitutions, 88
insertions, and 154 deletions, compared to the EBV reference genome. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that all NPC-EBV genomes were distinct from other EBV genomes. 
Furthermore, HN1 to HN18 had some nonsynonymous variations in EBV genes including
genes encoding latent, early lytic, and tegument proteins, such as substitutions 
within transmembrane domains 1 and 3 of LMP1, FoP_duplication, and zf-AD domains 
of ENBA1, in addition to aberrations in noncoding regions, especially in BamHI A 
rightward transcript microRNAs. These variations might have potential biological 
significance. In conclusion, we reported a genome-wide view of sequence variation
in EBV isolated from primary NPC biopsy specimens obtained from the Hunan
Province. This might contribute to further understanding of how genomic
variations contribute to carcinogenesis, which would impact the treatment of
EBV-associated cancer.IMPORTANCE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and exhibits remarkable ethnic
and geographic distribution. Hunan Province in southern China has a high
incidence rate of NPCs. Here, we report 18 novel EBV genome sequences from
viruses isolated from primary NPC biopsy specimens in this region, revealing
whole-genome sequence diversity.
