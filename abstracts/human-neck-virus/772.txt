OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a newly developed noninvasive ambulatory, quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection and
screening system (NP Screenâ„¢) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
STUDY DESIGN: Correlation of the nasopharyngeal epithelial EBV-DNA levels and
clinical findings by nasopharyngoscopy and final pathologic diagnosis of NPC with
biopsy.
SETTING: Multicenter ENT/Oncology clinics in Hong Kong (Radiation Oncology Clinic
at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Radiation Oncology Clinic and Head and Neck
Clinic, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong) and in Toronto, Canada (the
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Clinic at the Rouge Valley Health System and 2 large
ENT practices in Toronto).
METHODS: A single-use trans-oral brush was used for rapid, nontraumatic
nasopharyngeal (NP) epithelial cells DNA harvest in 600 Chinese patients,
combined with a preservation and shipping kit for remote, real-time Q-PCR EBV DNA
determinations.
RESULTS: All 600 patients had NP brushings using NP Screen in an ambulatory
environment, and no adverse events or complications were recorded. A final 578
patients were included with sufficient amount of DNA for completion of the Q-PCR 
assay. Of these 578 patients, 94 were confirmed positive for NPC histologically. 
The study yielded a sensitivity of 98.9%, specificity of 99.3%, positive
predictive value (PPV) of 96.9%, and negative predictive value (NPP) of 99.7% for
NP Screen in detecting NPC. Endoscopy had a sensitivity of 94%, specificity
97.1%, PPV 85%, and NPP 98.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The trans-oral brushing system fulfills the characteristics of a
noninvasive, sensitive, specific detection method suitable for routine,
large-scale ambulatory NPC risk assessment for high-risk NPC populations.
