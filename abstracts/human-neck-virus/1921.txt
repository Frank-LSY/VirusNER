Patients with human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCCs) have increased response to radio- and chemotherapy and
improved overall survival, possibly due to an impaired DNA damage response. Here,
we investigated the correlation between HPV status and repair of DNA damage in
HNSCC cell lines. We also assessed in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to the PARP
inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888) in HNSCC cell lines and an HPV+ patient xenograft. 
Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was significantly delayed in HPV+
compared to HPV- HNSCCs, resulting in persistence of Î³H2AX foci. Although DNA
repair activators 53BP1 and BRCA1 were functional in all HNSCCs, HPV+ cells
showed downstream defects in both non-homologous end joining and homologous
recombination repair. Specifically, HPV+ cells were deficient in protein
recruitment and protein expression of DNA-Pk and BRCA2, key factors for
non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination respectively.
Importantly, the apparent DNA repair defect in HPV+ HNSCCs was associated with
increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor veliparib, resulting in decreased
cell survival in vitro and a 10-14 day tumor growth delay in vivo. These results 
support the testing of PARP inhibition in combination with DNA damaging agents as
a novel therapeutic strategy for HPV+ HNSCC.
