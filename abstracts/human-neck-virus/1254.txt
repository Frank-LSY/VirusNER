BACKGROUND: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), nasal type, is an 
aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Currently, there is no recommended
standard therapy for relapsed NKTCL.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old woman with lymphadenopathy was diagnosed with
NKTCL by biopsy of an enlarged lymph node on the right side of her neck. Enhanced
computed tomography revealed no metastasis. For this patient, we performed
continuous chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy; however, nodule biopsy showed
metastases in her lower limbs 3Â months after radiotherapy, which confirmed
disease progression. Unfortunately, the patient' s temperature was persistently
high and her skin ulcers could not be controlled well using multi-line treatment.
Therefore, we attempted treatment with the anti-programmed-death-1 (PD-1)
antibody, pembrolizumab. Surprisingly, the patient achieved clinical complete
remission (CR) after four cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, despite having
persistent detectable Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. Other molecular monitoring
techniques were unavailable for this patient owing to the retrospective nature of
the study. The only adverse event was soreness of the upper limb joints and
muscles.
CONCLUSION: This relapsed NKTCL case treated with pembrolizumab showed that
multimodal therapy including pembrolizumab would be partially or totally
effective for relapsed NKTCL.
