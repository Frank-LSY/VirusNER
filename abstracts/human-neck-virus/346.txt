A 30-year-old male with bilateral acute visual loss presented with retinal edema 
in the posterior pole and peripapillary region with extensive retinal
hemorrhages. Fluorescein angiography revealed delayed arterial filling in the
right eye and absent arterial filling in the left eye, suggesting bilateral
central retinal artery occlusion. Systemic evaluation revealed a history of
chronic low-grade fever and generalized lymphadenopathy. HIV (ELISA) was
positive, and other systemic comorbidities were ruled out. Cervical lymph node
biopsy stained positive for acid-fast bacilli, with large areas of necrosis,
palisaded by epithelioid cell granulomas, macrophages, and multinucleated giant
cells, suggesting lymph node tuberculosis. Despite antiretroviral and
antitubercular therapy, he developed optic atrophy at 4 weeks.
