BACKGROUND: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been rising in recent years. Given the
clinical impact of HPV/p16 positivity in OPSCC, identifying surrogate markers of 
this disease early in the diagnostic work-up of these patients could improve
patient care.
METHODS: Demographic, pathologic, staging and PET-CT data from patients diagnosed
with OPSCC from 2009-2014 were obtained from a prospectively collected provincial
cancer registry. Tumor HPV/p16 status was correlated to the maximum standard
uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor and cervical nodes. Comparisons of
means and multinomial regression models were used to determine associations
between p16 status and SUVmax. A diagnostic odds ratio was calculated using a cut
off value for predicting HPV/p16 positivity based on nodal SUVmax.
RESULTS: PET-CT and HPV/p16 data was obtained for 65 patients treated surgically 
for OPSCC. Significantly higher nodal SUVmax was associated with HPV/p16 positive
nodes (SUVmax 10.8 vs 7.9). No significant differences were seen between HPV/p16 
positive vs negative primary tumor SUVmax (10.3 vs 13.7). In combination with
other clinical parameters, higher nodal SUVmax was highly correlated with HPV/p16
positivity.
CONCLUSION: Elevated nodal SUVmax is a significant predictor of HPV/p16 positive 
disease.
