Of 99 cases included in the study, six were positive for HPV: two with HPV16 and four with HPV6. BMI, AHI, age, and gender showed no significant differences between the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. Logistic regression to predict HPV positivity accounting for each variable and multivariate analysis were not statistically significant.
