The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancers has
been increasing in developed countries. We recently demonstrated that members of 
the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3, A3) family,
which are antiviral factors, can induce hypermutation of HPV DNA in vitro. In the
present study, we found numerous C-to-T and G-to-A hypermutations in the HPV16
genome in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) biopsy samples using differential DNA
denaturation PCR and next-generation sequencing. A3s were more abundantly
expressed in HPV16-positive OPCs than in HPV-negative, as assessed using
immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription quantitative PCR. In addition,
interferons upregulated A3s in an HPV16-positive OPC cell line. Furthermore,
quantitative PCR analysis of HPV DNA suggests that APOBEC3A (A3A) expression is
strongly correlated with the integration of HPV DNA. These results suggest that
HPV16 infection may upregulate A3A expression, thereby increasing the chance of
viral DNA integration. The role of A3A in HPV-induced carcinogenesis is
discussed.
