OBJECTIVE: Although elevated anti-mumps IgM antibody levels were reported in
5.7%-7.2% of Japanese patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL),
there were several reports of false-positive cases, such as the continually IgM
positive case and the IgM positive case in normal adults. To improve specificity,
the new enzyme immuno assay (EIA) anti-mumps IgM antibody measurement kit was
introduced in December 2009. This study re-examined the frequency of anti-mumps
IgM antibody test positivity with SSNHL using the new measurement kit and
compared the results with those from a previous report that used old kit.
METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional study involving patients
diagnosed with SSNHL who exhibited the anti-mumps IgM antibody. We compared the
positive rate of anti-mumps IgM antibody and the annual average number of mumps
cases per sentinel in Hokkaido between the patients in the present study and
patients previously evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients with SSNHL were enrolled. One case (1.0%) was
positive for anti-mumps IgM antibody. Of the 69 patients evaluated in the
previous study, 5 cases (7.2%) were positive for anti-mumps IgM antibody. The
positive rate of the anti-mumps IgM antibody in the present cases was
significantly lower than that previously reported (p=0.042). The annual average
number of mumps cases per sentinel in Hokkaido of the present and previous
surveillance period was 34.47 and 42.77, respectively; no significant difference 
was seen in these data (p=0.4519).
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that 1.0% of SSNHL was positive for the
anti-mumps IgM antibody using the new EIA-IgM measurement kit. After the
introduction of the new EIA-IgM measurement kit, anti-mumps IgM antibody positive
rate with SSNHL significantly decreased, indicating that the proportion of
asymptomatic mumps among etiology of SSNHL may be lower than those previously
reported.
