BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer is
associated with improved survival and treatment response as compared to
HPV-negative cancers. P16 overexpression is widely accepted as a surrogate marker
for HPV positivity.
METHODS: A total of 92 serum samples from 75 head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) patients were examined for HPV16 and 18 E7 antibodies by ELISA.
Available tissue was tested for HPV-DNA by PCR, and p16 immunohistochemistry was 
obtained from a deidentified database.
RESULTS: Of 75 HNSCC patients, 25 were HPV E7 seropositive. Seropositivity was
strongly associated with cancers of the oropharynx, and correlated with positive 
p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV-DNA. Post-treatment serum was available in
a limited subset of patients, revealing a decrease in antibody titers following
response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV E7 seropositivity correlated with positive tumor HPV-DNA and p16
expression, and was strongly associated with cancers of the oropharynx. E7
serology warrants further study as a potential biomarker in HPV-positive HNSCC.
