Basaloid squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) are a rare variant of SCC of the head and
neck. Their histological characteristics have been described by Wain in 1986 and 
are reported in the 2005 WHO classification. A poorer prognosis of BSCC has been 
reported. Two recent case-control studies have shown a higher rate of distant
metastases (15-40%, mean over 30%). Conversely, BSCC have similar or better
locoregional control rates, a relatively good radiosensitivity and locoregional
control. The role of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, concomitant or adjuvant
setting needs to be redefined due to high metastatic failure rates; chest CT or
PET CT are recommended at baseline and every 6-month during follow-up. Some
subgroups of BSCC (oropharynx in particular) are more likely to be associated
with oncogenic human papilloma virus HPV16. The determination of BSCC head and
neck subgroups by HPV status is critical for the prognosis. The basaloid sub-type
of squamous cell carcinomas owing to its particular behavior, should be taken
into account while deciding the optimal therapeutic strategy.
