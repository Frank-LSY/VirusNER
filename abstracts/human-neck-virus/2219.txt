Plasmablastic Lymphoma of oral cavity is an aggressive rare form of Non Hodgkin's
Lymphoma which is an Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome defining condition. Head
and neck region is the second most common area for extranodal NHL's primarily
involving gingiva and palate, which often presents as a diagnostic problem. We
report a case of PBL in a 19 year old female patient later diagnosed as Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive. She presented with expanding painful
ulceroproliferative lesion involving left mandible and gingiva of 20 days
duration. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis
confirmed the diagnosis. Uncommon discovery of multiple bony lesions in whole
body CT and hypercalcemia raise a question about Multiple Myeloma (MM).
Literature showed very few cases with osteolytic lesions and none of the cases
reported multiple bone lesions in skull. Our case report stresses the importance 
of differentiating this extremely rare case of PBL with skull lesions from MM.
