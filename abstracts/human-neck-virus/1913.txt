OBJECTIVES: To report a case of acute invasive Mucorales rhinosinusitis in a
patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and diabetes mellitus. To
provide a literature review on the role of Isavuconazole in the management of
invasive Mucorales rhinosinusitis.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted on August 9, 2015 using PubMed
database. The keywords isavuconazole and invasive fungal rhinosinusitis were
employed to identify original scientific manuscripts that describe the use of
Isavuconazole in patients with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis or rhinocerebral
mucormycosis.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 35 articles with only 1 article (case report)
describing the clinical use of Isavuconazole in a patient with invasive Mucorales
rhinosinusitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a rare, life-threatening
infection with mortality rates reported to range from 30-83%. Successful
treatment depends on early surgical debridement, systemic anti-fungal therapy,
and correction of predisposing conditions. Isavuconazole (Cresemba), a newly
approved antifungal, is safe and clinically effective in treating invasive
mucormycosis. This important new therapy should be considered for patients with
invasive Mucorales rhinosinusitis that is refractory or intolerant to
Amphotericin B.
