Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has
been identified as a distinct entity within squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck. In contrast to carcinomas associated with alcohol and/or tobacco, this 
subtype occurs at younger age, with frequent absence of classic risk factors,
correlation with oral sexual habits, strong predilection for the palatial tonsils
and the base of the tongue (lingual tonsils), basaloid or lymphoepithelial
differentiation, higher degree of radiosensitivity, and overall better survival. 
We report two cases of lymph node, metastatic, poorly differentiated squamous
cell carcinoma that were positive by immunohistochemistry for p16 with detection 
of HPV-16 and HPV-45 by PCR.
