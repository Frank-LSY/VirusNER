Oncoproteins from high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) downregulate the
transcription of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) antigen
presentation apparatus in tissue culture model systems. This could allow infected
or transformed cells to evade the adaptive immune response. Using data from over 
800 human cervical and head &amp; neck tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we determined the impact of HPV status on the mRNA expression of all six 
MHC-I heavy chain genes, and the β2 microglobulin light chain. Unexpectedly,
these genes were all expressed at high levels in HPV positive (HPV+) cancers
compared with normal control tissues. Indeed, many of these genes were expressed 
at significantly enhanced levels in HPV+ tumors. Similarly, the transcript levels
of several other components of the MHC-I peptide-loading complex were also high
in HPV+ cancers. The coordinated expression of high mRNA levels of the MHC-I
antigen presentation apparatus could be a consequence of the higher intratumoral 
levels of interferon γ in HPV+ carcinomas, which correlate with signatures of
increased infiltration by T- and NK-cells. These data, which were obtained from
both cervical and oral tumors in large human cohorts, indicates that HPV
oncoproteins do not efficiently suppress the transcription of the antigen
presentation apparatus in human tumors.
