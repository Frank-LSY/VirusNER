OBJECTIVE: (1) To determine baseline demographic, geographic, clinical, and
pathologic characteristics of patients who had transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
for oropharyngeal cancer. (2) To analyze margin status and unplanned readmission 
after TORS versus nonrobotic surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review.
SETTING: National Cancer Database (2010-2011).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Searching the National Cancer Database for adults with
oropharyngeal cancer, we identified 877 patients who had TORS and 4269 patients
who had nonrobotic surgery. Outcomes of interest included likelihood of adjuvant 
therapy, margin status, and unplanned readmission. Statistical analysis included 
chi-square, t tests, and multivariate regression.
RESULTS: From 2010 to 2011, there was a 67% increase in the use of TORS for
oropharyngeal cancer. Compared with patients who had nonrobotic surgery, TORS
patients were more likely to be at academic centers (80.8% vs 49.1%, P < .001),
to have private insurance (62.2% vs 57.4%, P < .001), and to have human papilloma
virus (HPV)-positive tumors (48.3% vs 27.1%, P < .001). TORS (odds ratio, 0.50;
95% CI, 0.39-0.63) and HPV positivity (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.99) were 
independently associated with decreased likelihood of adjuvant chemoradiation
versus radiation therapy. TORS patients were less likely to have positive margins
than were patients who had nonrobotic surgery (20.2% vs 31.0%, P < .001).
High-volume TORS centers had lower rates of positive margins (15.8% vs 26.1%, P <
.001) and unplanned readmissions (3.1% vs 6.1%, P < .03) than did low-volume
centers.
CONCLUSIONS: TORS is being rapidly adopted by academic and community cancer
centers. TORS is associated with a lower rate of positive margins than nonrobotic
surgery, and high-volume centers have the lowest rates of positive margins and
unplanned readmissions.
