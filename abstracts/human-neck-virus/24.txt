A collaborative practice model related to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated 
oropharyngeal cancer highlights the role of the dental hygienist in addressing
this condition.BACKGROUND: The incidence of HPV associated head and neck cancer
is rising. Multiple professionals including the dental hygienist can work
collaboratively to confront this growing public health concern.
METHODS: A critical review applies the growth and utilization of
interprofessional education (IPE) and interprofessional collaboration (IPC) to
multi-disciplinary models addressing the human papilloma virus and oropharyngeal 
cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: A model related to HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer addresses an 
oral systemic condition that supports the inclusion of a dental hygienist on
collaborative teams addressing prevention, detection, treatment and cure of OPC.
