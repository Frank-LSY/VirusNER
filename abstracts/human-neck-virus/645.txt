INTRODUCTION: Involvement of cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII by varicella-zoster 
virus (VZV) is widely reported in the literature, whereas involvement of cranial 
nerves IX and X is rarer and therefore poorly characterized.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature through 
MEDLINE (up to January 2012). We selected cases reporting pharyngolaryngeal
involvement by VZV and extracted clinical features, complementary studies,
treatments, and outcome. We added three cases to the existing literature.
RESULTS: Of the 65 screened articles, 38 were included reporting 54 cases. The
main clinical features were odynodysphagia and dysphonia reflecting underlying
hemipharyngolaryngeal palsy. Vesicles were seen in 66% of the patients. Besides
the involvement of cranial nerves IX and X, concomitant involvement of other
cranial nerves was seen in 48% of the cases. The most concerned nerves were
cranial nerves VII and VIII. Virological tests (63%) and imaging (28%) were
performed, with the latter being systematically normal. Seventy-two percent of
patients were treated with antiviral agents and/or corticosteroids. Twenty-six
percent of patients made a full recovery while the remaining had some persistent 
deficits. We did not find statistically significant differences in outcomes
according to age or treatments received.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngolaryngeal involvement by VZV is rare and seldom restricted
to the ninth and tenth cranial nerves. It occurs mostly within the context of
cranial polyneuropathy. Regardless of the treatment, full recovery is rare and
long-term sequelae persist in many cases, especially with speech and swallowing
impairment. Close monitoring and follow-up are therefore essential.
