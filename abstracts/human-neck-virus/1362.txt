Exosomes and microvesicles (MVs) are nanometer-sized, membranous vesicles
secreted from many cell types into their surrounding extracellular space and into
body fluids. These two classes of extracellular vesicles are regarded as a novel 
mechanism through which cancer cells, including virally infected cancer cells,
regulate their micro-environment via the horizontal transfer of bioactive
molecules: proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, micro-RNAs; oncogenic 
cargo hence often referred to as oncosomes). In head and neck cancer (HNC),
exosomes and MVs have been described in Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-associated
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), as well as being positively correlated with oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progression. It has therefore been suggested that 
HNC-derived vesicles could represent a useful source for biomarker discovery,
enriched in tumor antigens and cargo; hence fundamentally important for cancer
progression. This current review offers an overall perspective on the roles of
exosomes and MVs in HNC biology, focusing on EBV-associated NPC and OSCC. We also
highlight the importance of saliva as a proximal and easily accessible bio-fluid 
for HNC detection, and propose that salivary vesicles might serve as an
alternative model in the discovery of novel HNC biomarkers.
