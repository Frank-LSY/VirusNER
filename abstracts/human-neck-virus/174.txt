Through combining vaccine-derived measles and mumps viruses (MM), we efficiently 
targeted a wide range of hematopoietic cancer cell lines. MM synergistically
killed many cell lines including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Further
investigation suggested that enhanced oncolytic effect of MM was due to increased
apoptosis induction. In an U937 xenograft AML mouse model, MM displayed greater
tumor suppression and prolonged survival. Furthermore, MM efficiently killed
blasts from 16 out of 20 AML patients and elicited more efficient killing effect 
on 11 patients when co-administered with Ara-C. Our results demonstrate that MM
is a promising therapeutic candidate for hematological malignancies.
