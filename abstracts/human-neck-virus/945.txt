In total, 163 of 841 (19.4%) tumors were HPV-positive. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC had a more favorable overall survival [73.5% versus 40.9% after 5 years; P < 0.001; hazard ratio = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.48] compared with patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. Patients with p16-positive but HPV DNA-negative tumors showed a significantly less favorable survival than patients with p16-positive and HPV DNA-positive tumors (P < 0.001). A prognostic model was developed in which patients were classified into three risk groups according to HPV status, nodal stage and comorbidity. [Harrell's concordance index of 0.68 (95% CI 0.65-0.71)].
