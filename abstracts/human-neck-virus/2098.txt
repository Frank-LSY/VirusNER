BACKGROUND: For more than 20 years, infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV)
has been of a matter of interest not only to gynecologists but also to
maxillofacial surgeons and othorhinolaryngologists. HPV is generally known to be 
involved in cervical cancer. Recently, there are many clinical studies pointed
out the potentially dangerous connection between HPV infection and head and neck 
carcinomas (HNC). HPV infection was identified as a possible etiological factor
in 15-30% of HNC.
METHODS: Aim of this article is to summarize the recent knowledge about the HPV
infection with regards to etiology of head and neck cancer.
RESULTS: It has been proven that HPV infection is related to development of head 
and neck cancer and that the sexual behavior has played an important role in the 
viral transmission. HNC of viral etiology have been observed mostly in younger
people; their curability is difficult and prognosis serious.
CONCLUSION: Beside the well known correlation between developing of new head and 
neck cancer and bad habits (smoking, alcohol abuse, poor oral hygiene etc.) we
should take into consideration the sexual promiscuity and alternative sexual
practices. Vaccination against cervical cancer, recommended to young women,
should be extended to their male partners to prevent the virus transmission and
decrease the HNC incidence.
