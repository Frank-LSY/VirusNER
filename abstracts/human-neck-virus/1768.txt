BACKGROUND: The immune system plays an important role in tumour immune
surveillance. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients are often immune
compromised.
OBJECTIVE: To chart the baseline levels of T-cell subpopulation frequencies in
patients with cancer prior to treatment.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of patients were taken at the time of
diagnosis, analysed with flowcytometry and compared with blood samples of healthy
donors.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy donors, a significant shift from naive to effector
memory T cells was observed. This effect was most prominent in stage II patients.
A similar shift from naive to effector memory T cells was noted in patients with 
oropharynx or larynx squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, the percentage of
effector memory and effector T cells was higher in the group of patients with
human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, compared
with patients with human papillomavirus-negative tumours, suggestive of
virus-induced T-cell activation.
CONCLUSION: Here, we provide a simple and easily implementable tool to document T
lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of head and neck cancer patients,
which might be useful for prognosis and/or therapy response prediction.
