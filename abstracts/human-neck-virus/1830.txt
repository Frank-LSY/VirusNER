BACKGROUND: Oral high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections are frequent 
and persistent among the HIV-positive population and are associated with an
increased risk for head and neck cancer (HNC). In this study, we sought to
determine the incidence, persistence and clearance of HPV infections in oral and 
oropharyngeal samples from HIV/AIDS subjects.
METHODS: A longitudinal, observational and analytical study was performed with an
ongoing cohort of HIV/AIDS subjects in Mexico City (September 2013-February
2015). The study was approved by institutional committees, and demographic and
clinical data were registered. At the baseline and three-month visits, oral
examinations and cytobrush samples were obtained. DNA was purified, quantified
and used to detect an HPV-L1 gene fragment by nested PCR, using MY09/MY11 and GP5
+ /GP6 + primers. HPV DNA products were purified, sequenced and typed according
to HPV databases. Risk factors were assessed, and a multivariate modelling
approach was used to determine independent effects.
RESULTS: This study included 97 HIV/AIDS individuals (91% men [86.4% of which are
men who have sex with men], median age: 36 years, 72.2% under HAART). From the
baseline visit, HPV was observed in 55.7% (HR-HPV: 26.8%; HPV-18: 24.1%), with a 
higher HPV-positive samples for smokers (61.1 vs 32.6%, P = .005). The
three-month overall HPV incidence was 33.9%; type-specific HPV persistence was
33.3% (HR-HPV: 13.3%); and 13 of the 33 (39.4%) baseline HPV-positive individuals
cleared the infection (HR-HPV: 53.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although HR-HPV persistence was low, and clearance of the infection 
was observed in most cases, a close follow-up is necessary, given the increase in
HNC among HIV-subjects, particularly HPV-related cancer.
