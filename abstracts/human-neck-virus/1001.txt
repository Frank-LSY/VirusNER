BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.
Evidence for a similar aetiological role in the development of oral dysplasia or 
its transformation to oral cancer is not as clear. Meta-analyses estimate the
prevalence of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) serotypes to be three times
higher in pre-malignant lesions and cancer than in normal oral mucosa. However,
this does not imply a causal relationship. Conflicting results are reported from 
the few studies examining the prognostic significance of HPV positivity in the
development of oral cancer. We aimed to examine the ability of p16(INK4a) protein
expression, a surrogate marker of HPV infection, to predict malignant progression
in a large cohort of oral dysplasia patients.
METHODS: One hundred forty eight oral dysplasia cases underwent
immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody against p16(INK4a) .
Clinical factors were also collated on each case. Slides were double scored
independently by two trained observers. Univariate analyses using both logistic
and Cox regression models were performed.
RESULTS: Thirty nine of 148 cases progressed to cancer. Ten of 148 cases (7%)
were p16(INK4a) positive. High grade of dysplasia (P = 0.0002) and lesion
morphology (P = 0.03) were found to be prognostic of malignant progression.
p16(INK4a) score was not prognostic in this cohort (P = 0.29). This did not
change with a time to event analysis (P = 0.24).
CONCLUSION: Few studies have assessed the aetiological role of HPV in cancer
development from dysplastic lesions. Our study, using one of the largest cohorts 
of oral dysplasia, demonstrated a low rate of p16(INK4a) positivity and was
unable to confirm a prognostic ability for this biomarker.
