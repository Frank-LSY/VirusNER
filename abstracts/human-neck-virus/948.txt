Human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development of cervical cancer and is also involved in vulvar, anus, penis and head and neck cancer. Little is known about the role of HPV infection in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Through a systematic review of the literature, we studied the HPV prevalence in immunocompetent individuals in relation to NMSC. We found that HPV, including multiple HPV types, tended to be more prevalent in NMSC, especially in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to basal cell carcinoma and healthy skin, indicating a potential link between HPV and SCC in immunocompetent individuals.
