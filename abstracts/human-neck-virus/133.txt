One in six cancers worldwide is caused by infection and human papillomavirus
(HPV) is one of the main culprits. To better understand the dynamics of HPV
integration and its effect on both the viral and host methylomes, we conducted
whole-genome DNA methylation analysis using MeDIP-seq of HPV+ and HPV- head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We determined the viral subtype to be
HPV-16 in all cases and show that HPV-16 integrates into the host genome at
multiple random sites and that this process predominantly involves the
transcriptional repressor gene (E2) in the viral genome. Comparative analysis
identified 453 (FDR ≤ 0.01) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the HPV+ 
host methylome. Bioinformatics characterization of these DMRs confirmed the
previously reported cadherin genes to be affected but also revealed new targets
for HPV-mediated methylation changes at regions not covered by array-based
platforms, including the recently identified super-enhancers.
