PURPOSE: Transfer of prodrug activation systems into tumors by using
replication-deficient viruses has been suggested to be an effective method for
achieving high local and low systemic anticancer drug concentrations. However,
most current suicide gene therapy strategies are still hindered by poor
efficiency of in vivo gene transfer, inefficient tumor penetration, limited
bystander cell killing effect, and need of large prodrug doses. We hypothesized
that local amplification provided by a replication competent platform would help 
overcome these limitations.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a transductionally and transcriptionally
targeted oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-Delta24FCU1 expressing the fusion suicide
gene FCU1. FCU1 encodes a bifunctional fusion protein that efficiently catalyzes 
the direct conversion of 5-FC, a relatively nontoxic antifungal agent, into the
toxic metabolites 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorouridine monophosphate, bypassing the
natural resistance of certain human tumor cells to 5-fluorouracil.
RESULTS: We examined the efficacy of Ad5/3-Delta24FCU1 and the
replication-defective control Ad5/3-FCU1 with and without 5-FC. FCU1 expression
was confirmed by Western blot, whereas enzymatic conversion levels in vitro and
in vivo were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography separation.
Significant antitumor effect was observed in vitro and in vivo in a murine model 
of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Although we observed a decrease in
viral DNA copy number in vitro and in tumors treated with Ad5/3-Delta24FCU1 and
5-FC, suggesting an effect on virus replication, the highest antitumor effect was
observed for this combination.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems feasible and efficacious to combine adenovirus replication 
to the FCU1 prodrug activation system.
