BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of patients with
p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with
postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) before and after an
institutional dose reduction policy effective on February 2009.
METHODS: Between 1998 and 2013, 175 consecutive patients with p16-positive
oropharyngeal SCC with extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or close or positive
margins were treated postoperatively to 66 Gy (n = 109) or 60 Gy (n = 66) in 2
Gy/fx.
RESULTS: Between the 66 and 60 Gy groups, there was no difference in tumor
classification (pT4 vs pT1-T3; p = .181) and nodal classification (pN2c-N3 vs
pN0-N2b; p = .704), and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) group stage (IV
vs I-III; p = .473). Median follow-up was 5.9 years overall (66 Gy: 7.4 years; 60
Gy: 4.0 years). There was no difference in locoregional recurrence-free survival 
(2-year: 98.1% vs 98.5%; p = .421).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that treating p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC with
ECE and/or close or positive margins with postoperative IMRT to 60 Gy may not
compromise locoregional recurrence-free survival compared to 66 Gy. © 2016 Wiley
