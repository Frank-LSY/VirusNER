IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Advanced melanoma is a devastating disease with a five
year survival for Stage IV disease of 10 - 20% and a median survival of 6 - 18
months depending on sub-stage. Current FDA approved therapies demonstrate limited
response rates, few complete remissions and no proven survival benefit. New
therapies are clearly needed. JSI/34.5-/47-/GM-CSF is a herpes simplex virus-1
(OncoVEX(GM-CSF)) oncolytic vaccine therapy designed to induce local and systemic
anti-tumor immune responses.
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Evolution of current herpes simplex virus oncolytic
vaccines from preclinical to clinical studies from 1994 to 2010.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Preclinical studies have shown that herpes simplex
virus-1 oncolytic vaccines generate local tumor destruction through the lytic
action of the virus and local and systemic immune responses. Phase I studies
demonstrated limited toxicities with no neurotoxicty. Phase II studies
demonstrated durable regressions in patients with metastatic melanoma. A Phase
III trial in melanoma is ongoing to determine clinical effectiveness, and a Phase
III trial in head and neck cancer will initiate during 2010.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: JSI/34.5-/47-/GM-CSF is a new generation herpes simplex
virus-1 oncolytic vaccine that demonstrates direct tumor lysis and systemic
immune responses. Early clinical studies have yielded preliminary evidence of
activity.
