Intratumoral injection of OBP-301 resulted in the shrinkage of human SCCHN tumors orthotopically implanted into the tongues of BALB/c nu/nu mice and significantly recovered weight loss by enabling oral ingestion. The levels of GFP expression following ex vivo infection of OBP-401 may be of value as a positive predictive marker for the outcome of telomerase-specific virotherapy. Moreover, whole-body fluorescent imaging revealed that intratumorally injected OBP-401 could visualize the metastatic lymph nodes, indicating the ability of the virus to traffic to the regional lymphatic area and to selectively replicate in neoplastic lesions, resulting in GFP expression and cell death in metastatic lymph nodes.
