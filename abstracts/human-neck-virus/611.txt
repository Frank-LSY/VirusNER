There is increasing molecular and epidemiologic evidence that human
papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with distinct subset of head and neck lesions.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible relationship between the 
presence of HPV DNA and morphological signs of HPV infections in twenty-six
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and
seventeen cases of sinonasal inverted papillomas, retrieved from archival
material. Ten out of twenty-six cases of cancers and eleven out of seventeen
sinonasal inverted papillomas showed morphological signs of HPV infections. All
cases have been analyzed using in situ hybridization. The expression of HPV DNA
was noted in both examined groups of squamous cell carcinomas and in group of
sinonasal inverted papillomas when the morphological signs of HPV infections were
present. No significant differences in the frequency of HPV DNA expression were
noted in both examined groups of cancers and inverted papillomas (with and
without morphological signs of HPV infection). In conclusion, our study confirms 
the role of HPVs in pathogenesis of inverted papillomas and laryngeal squamous
cell carcinomas. However, there is no relevant relationship between the presence 
of HPV DNA and morphological signs of HPV infections in studied cases.
