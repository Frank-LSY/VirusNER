BACKGROUND: We aimed to elucidate possible differences in antiviral defense in
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) mucosal tissue compared to
healthy mucosal tissue (HMT) upon herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) exposure.
METHODOLOGY: HMT and CRSwNP samples were infected with HSV1. We visualized the
virus location by immunofluorescence and monitored invasion by a score. The
mediators Interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ, IFN-γ, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β,
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10 were measured in culture
supernatants at baseline and at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after virus incubation.
RESULTS: CRSwNP mucosal tissue showed a significant deficit in IFN-γ and IL-17
release within 24 to 72 hours after infection in comparison to HMT, at the same
time releasing significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and 
TNF-α. These findings were associated with significantly higher viral invasion
scores at 48 and 72 h in CRSwNP mucosa compared to those for the HMT.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time in a human ex-vivo mucosal model
that the inadequate response of CRSwNP may be associated with a deeper intrusion 
of viruses into the mucosal tissue, and may contribute to more and longer
symptoms upon acute infection, but also to the persistence of inflammation in
CRSwNP tissue.
