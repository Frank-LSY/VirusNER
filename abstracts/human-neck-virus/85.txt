Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is uncommon in the United States, with only 0.2 to 0.5
cases per 100,00 people; this is in contrast to southern China and Hong Kong,
where the incidence is 25 to 50 per 100,000 people. There is a potential link
between Epstein-Barr virus and the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Radiotherapy alone as a single modality leads to similar 10-year survival rates
in United States, Denmark, and Hong Kong (34%, 37%, and 43%, respectively).
Multiple studies have shown an advantage to concurrent chemoradiation in the
treatment of advanced disease. Radiation therapy remains the mainstay of salvage 
therapy, and modern techniques have allowed clinicians to achieve adequate local 
control without excessive toxicity.
