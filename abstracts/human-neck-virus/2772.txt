BACKGROUND: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EB nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1)
protein is required for maintenance and transmission of the viral episome in
EBV-infected cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of
EBNA1 protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: Tissue samples from 48 patients with NPC and 12 patients with chronic
nasopharyngitis were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis of EBNA1
expression. EBNA1 combinational DNA was used to overexpress EBNA1 protein in NPC 
cell lines to assess tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), colony
formation, migration and invasion, and gene expression.
RESULTS: EBNA1 protein was highly expressed in NPC tissue specimens, and its
expression was associated with NPC lymph node metastasis. EBNA1 expression
affected NPC cell morphology and the expression of EMT markers in vitro.
Furthermore, overexpression of EBNA1 inhibited the expression of microRNA 200a
(miR-200a) and miR-200b and, in turn, up-regulated expression of their target
genes, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 ( ZEB1) and ZEB2, which are well
known mediators of EMT. In addition, EBNA1-regulated miR-200a and miR-200b
expression was mediated by transforming growth factor-β1.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings provided novel insight into the vital role of
EBNA1 in manipulating a molecular switch of EMT in EBV-positive NPC cells.
