INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known prognostic indicator in
oropharyngeal cancer. Not much is known about the prognostic role of HPV in
Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Here, we performed a systematic review and
meta-analysis of the literature to investigate if HPV status was a prognostic
factor for NPC.
METHODS: PubMed (via the web), Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were
searched. A systematic review and meta-analysis was done to generate the pooled
Hazard Ratios (HR) for Overall Survival (OS).
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies from 2014 to 2018, reporting data on 2646 patients 
(range 43-1328) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that 
HPV/p16 status was not associated with OS in NPC with HR of 0.77 (95% CI:
0.55-1.09, p = 0.14). The test for heterogeneity showed little to no
heterogeneity of results (I2 = 4%, p = 0.38). Subgroup analysis showed that in
large sample sizes, HPV was significantly associated with survival.
CONCLUSION: Despite the finding in the pooled HR, we could not draw a definitive 
conclusion as to the prognostic significance of HPV in NPC. Recommendations for
future research are given.
