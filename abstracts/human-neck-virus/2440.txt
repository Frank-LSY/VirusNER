A 63-year-old female suffering from hepatitis C virus infection and manic
depression was admitted with a 4-month history of hoarseness. Endoscopic
examination revealed the presence of a neoplasm with a smooth surface in the left
supraglottic region extending to the left false vocal cord. Based on the
histological findings, together with the results of systemic evaluation, the
patient was diagnosed as having a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
lymphoma in clinical stage IE, according to the Ann Arbor classification. After
one month of follow-up, the patient presented with involvement of multiple
subcutaneous regions in the left neck area, etc. Biopsies revealed the same type 
of lymphoma as that in the supraglottis. The disease was considered to have
progressed to clinical stage IV. Six courses of R-CVP (rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) treatment resulted in complete
remission of all lesions. Primary MALT lymphoma in the larynx is extremely rare. 
Since the first description by Diebold et al in 1990, only 43 cases have been
reported. Among these reported cases, only 7 (16%) with progressive stages were
described. The R-CVP regimen appears to be effective for the treatment of
progressive primary MALT lymphoma of the larynx. Furthermore, hepatitis C virus
infection is thought to be closely associated with the aggressive malignant
process and subcutaneous dissemination.
