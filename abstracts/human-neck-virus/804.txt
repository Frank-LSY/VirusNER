We changed the primary oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treatment
recommendation from primary radiation therapy (RT) to tumor surgery and neck
dissection, followed by RT around the year 2000 with apparently improved
survival. However, high-risk human papilloma virus (hr-HPV)-16-caused OPSCCs have
increased during this period. Furthermore, hr-HPV+ OPSCC carry a better prognosis
than hr-HPV-negative patients. We have, therefore, evaluated the 5-year survival 
in the period from 1992 to 1999 versus 2000 to 2008 stratified by hr-HPV tumor
infection status. Ninety-six OPSCC patients were treated from 1992 to 1999
compared with 136 patients from 2000 to 2008. The 5-year disease-specific
survival (DDS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded, while the health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) scores were obtained from some of the cured patients.
Thirty-eight (40 %) in the first period and 86 OPSCCs (63 %) in the second period
were hr-HPV+. In the first period, 16 versus 62 patients in the last period were 
treated by neck dissection, primary tumor surgery, and RT. DSS among all the
hr-HPV-negative patients in the first period was 51 versus 55 % in the second
period, and the corresponding OS was 33 versus 31 %, respectively. The DSS among 
all the hr-HPV+ patients was 78 % in the first period versus 77 % in the second
period, while the OS was 71 versus 69 %, respectively. The HRQoL scores among
successfully treated patients were worse following surgery, plus RT than RT only.
The hr-HPV-adjusted 5-year survival in OPSCC patients was similar between the two
time periods. A decreased HRQoL was associated with surgical therapy, which
indicates that hr-HPV+ OPSCC patients may be treated by primary RT followed by
major surgery only if RT treatment fails.
