Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are among the most aggressive types of cancer. The Simian virus 40 (SV40), which is a polyomavirus known for its oncogenic potential, was found as a contaminant of oral vaccines and has been related to human pleomorphic adenoma in the parotid gland. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of SV40 and 2 human polyomaviruses-BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV)-in a large sample of SCCs of the oral cavity.
