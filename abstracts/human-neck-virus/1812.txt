BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the aberrant
expression of cell-cycle or immune-response markers together with human
papillomavirus (HPV) positivity impacts patient survival in different head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subsets.
METHODS: A total of 59 HNSCC specimens were analyzed for expression of cell cycle
and proliferation markers, and macrophage infiltration. HPV was evaluated by
polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The HPV presence in oropharynx carcinoma was associated with survival
advantage. Low Ki67 expression was associated with favorable outcome in
oropharynx and oral cavity carcinoma. A more favorable outcome was associated
with low cyclin E expression in larynx carcinoma and with low p53 expression in
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity. A direct correlation between
macrophage infiltration and tumor proliferation index was observed irrespective
of the tumor subset.
CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of proliferation, viral, and immunologic profiles may
be crucial to finding beneficial treatments for the different HNSCC subsets.
