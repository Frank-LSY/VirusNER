Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) have a
better prognosis than patients with non-HPV-induced OPSCC. The role of the immune
response in this phenomenon is yet unclear. We studied the number of T cells,
regulatory T cells (Tregs), T helper 17 (Th17) cells and IL-17(+) non-T cells
(mainly granulocytes) in matched HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC cases (n =
162). Furthermore, the production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by tumor-infiltrating T
cells was analyzed. The number of tumor-infiltrating T cells and Tregs was higher
in HPV-positive than HPV-negative OPSCC (p < 0.0001). In contrast, HPV-negative
OPSCC contained significantly higher numbers of IL-17(+) non-T cells (p <
0.0001). Although a high number of intra-tumoral T cells showed a trend toward
improved survival of all OPSCC patients, their prognostic effect in patients with
a low number of intra-tumoral IL-17(+) non-T cells was significant with regard to
disease-specific (p = 0.033) and disease-free survival (p = 0.012). This suggests
that a high frequency of IL-17(+) non-T cells was related to a poor immune
response, which was further supported by the observation that a high number of T 
cells was correlated with improved disease-free survival in the HPV-positive
OPSCC (p = 0.008). In addition, we detected a minor Th17 cell population.
However, T cells obtained from HPV-positive OPSCC produced significantly more
IL-17 than those from HPV-negative tumors (p = 0.006). The improved prognosis of 
HPV-positive OPSCC is thus correlated with higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating T
cells, more active Th17 cells and lower numbers of IL-17(+) non-T cells.
