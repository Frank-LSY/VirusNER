BACKGROUND: Superior treatment response and survival for patients with human
papilloma virus (HPV)-positive head and neck cancer (HNSCC) are documented in
clinical studies. However, the relevance of high-grade acute organ toxicity
(HGAOT), which has also been correlated with improved prognosis, has attracted
scant attention in HPV-positive HNSCC patients. Hence we tested the hypothesis
that both parameters, HPV and HGAOT, are positive prognostic factors in patients 
with HNSCC treated with definite radiotherapy (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment tumor tissue and clinical records were
available from 233 patients receiving definite RT (62 patients) or RCT (171
patients). HPV infection was analysed by means of HPV DNA detection or p16(INK4A)
expression; HGAOT was defined as the occurrence of acute organ toxicity >grade 2 
according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. Both variables were correlated with
overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Positivity for HPV DNA (44 samples, 18.9 %) and p16(INK4A) expression
(102 samples, 43.8 %) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01), and HGAOT
occurred in 77 (33 %) patients. Overall, the 5-year OS was 23 %; stratified for
p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, OS rates were 47 %, 42 %, 20 % and 10 % for
patients with p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, patients with HGAOT only, patients
with p16(INK4A) expression only, and patients without p16(INK4A) expression or
HGAOT, respectively. After multivariate testing p16(INK4A) expression (p = 0.003)
and HGAOT (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with OS.
CONCLUSION: P16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT are independent prognostic factors
for OS of patients with HNSCC, whereas p16(INK4A) expression is particularly
important for patients without HGAOT.
