The combination of NHL and documented malignancy-associated glomerulonephritis is
uncommon. Also, no single renal pathological entity is consistently found in
patients with NHL. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may manifest as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a
genetically/ immunologically susceptible individual with defective cytotoxic
T-cell response against EBV. We describe lupus nephritis in a 45 years old male
suffering from untreated NHL. CD20+ DLBCL was demonstrated by
immunohistochemistry of the neck lymph node (LN) biopsy performed for generalized
lymphadenopathy. Renal biopsy revealed class V + IV lupus nephritis. Serology
demonstrated EBV infection. Complete clinical remission of both SLE and DLBCL was
achieved post-therapy with six-cycle rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristin,
adriablastin, methylprednisolone (R-CHOP) regime. This case report demonstrated
the complex relationships between NHL, SLE, EBV and membranous
glomerulonephritis. The presented case is remarkable not only because of the rare
association of SLE and DLBCL, but also because of its successful treatment with
R-CHOP.
