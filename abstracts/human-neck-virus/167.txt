The association between human papillomaviruses (HPV) and oral cancer was
initially suggested nearly 30 years ago by us. Today, the research interest of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has substantially increased.
HPV-associated HNSCC is considered a distinct clinical entity with better
prognosis than the classical tobacco and alcohol associated cancers. HPV 16 seems
to be the main genotype present in HNSCC and it most probably utilizes the same
pathways in epithelial cell transformation as established for genital cancer.
High-risk HPV E6 and E7 target the well characterized cellular proteins p53 and
Rb, respectively. In addition, several other cellular targets of E6 and E7 have
been identified. This review gives an overview on the biology of HPV which aids
in dissecting the role of HPV in head and neck carcinogenesis. It also summarizes
the possible pathways involved in creating new tools for diagnosis and therapy of
HPV-associated HNSCC.
