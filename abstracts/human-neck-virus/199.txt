In recent years, our knowledge and understanding of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) has expanded dramatically. New high-throughput sequencing
technologies have accelerated these discoveries since the first reports of
whole-exome sequencing of HNSCC tumors in 2011. In addition, the discovery of
human papillomavirus in relationship with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
has shifted our molecular understanding of the disease. New investigation into
the role of immune evasion in HNSCC has also led to potential novel therapies
based on immune-specific systemic therapies.
