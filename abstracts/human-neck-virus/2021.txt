The undifferentiated form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common
malignant head and neck cancer in South China, especially in Cantonese
populations. However, few NPC cell lines have been established from the patients 
in this region. In this study, we established a new NPC cell line, termed SUNE2, 
from a Cantonese patient with undifferentiated NPC. This cell line had extremely 
low concentrations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in long-term culture and
expressed low levels of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), latent membrane protein
2A (LMP2A), BamH1-A right frame 1 (BARF1), EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER1), and
EBV-encoded RNA-2 (EBER2) in early passages. SUNE2 cells also showed much
stronger transforming ability than 5-8F cells in colony formation assays and
anchorage-independent growth assays in soft agar, and they only need 2 weeks to
form tumors in nude mice. In summary, the SUNE2 cell line is a new in vitro model
that can be used for further research on the mechanisms underlying the occurrence
and development of NPC.
