The oral cavity is inhibited by many of the bacterial species. Some of them have 
a key role in the development of oral disease. Interrelationships between oral
microbiome and systemic conditions such as head-and-neck cancer have become
increasingly appreciated in recent years. Emerging evidence also suggests a link 
between periodontal disease and oral cancer, and the explanation being that
chronic inflammation could be a major factor in both diseases. Squamous cell
carcinoma is that the most frequently occurring malignancy of the oral cavity and
adjacent sites, representing over 90% of all cancers. The incidence of oral
cancer is increasing, significantly among young people and women. Worldwide there
are 350,000-400,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi 
are strongly implicated as etiological factors in certain cancers. In this review
we will discuss the association between the development of oral cancer in
potentially malignant oral lesions with chronic periodontitis, chronic
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, candida, other microbes and
described mechanisms which may be involved in these carcinoma.
