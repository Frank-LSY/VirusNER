BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) are two distinct entities. We defined the
molecular profiles of druggable receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in both groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: E5 expression and RTK alterations were studied in 17
HPV-positive and 59 HPV-negative formalin-fixed OSCCs. RTK activation was
explored in further 12 frozen OSCCs.
RESULTS: The HPV-positive OSCCs showed E5 expression and 33.3% expressed low
level of HER2. The HPV-negative OSCCs showed HER2 expression (31.2%), increased
HER2 gene copy number (46.51%, P = 0.045) and HER2 activation through HER2/EGFR
heterodimerisation; HER3 (51.06%, P = 0.008) and neuregulin (65.63%; P = 0.03)
expression, HER3 activation and HER3/EGFR heterodimerisation; and increased
IGF-1R copy number (40.50%, P = 0.021), high IGF-1R cDNA values (P = 0.002),
IGF-1R activation and expression of IGF1/2 and amphiregulin. PI3KCA
mutations/expression/increased gene copy number and PTEN mutations were found in 
both groups, whereas PTEN gene loss was only observed in the HPV-positive cases.
CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus-positive and HPV-negative OSCC showed different 
RTK profiles. In HPV-positive cases, it would be interesting to study the
expression of E5, which may modulate EGFR turnover and activate VEGF and PDGFRβ. 
In HPV-negative cases, HER3 may be a promising druggable biomarker that deserves 
further investigation. PI3KCA and PTEN alterations encourage the promising
clinical evaluation of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor activity in OSCC, particularly in
HPV-positive/PI3KCA-mutated OSCCs because they may be driven by PI3KCA mutation
alone.
