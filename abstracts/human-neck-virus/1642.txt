BACKGROUND: The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) caused
by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is rising worldwide. HPV-OPSCC is
commonly diagnosed by RT-qPCR of HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins or by p16
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been recently
reported as an ultra-sensitive and highly precise method of nucleic acid
quantification for biomarker analysis. To validate the use of a minimally
invasive assay for detection of oncogenic HPV based on oropharyngeal swabs using 
ddPCR. Secondary objectives were to compare the accuracy of ddPCR swabs to fresh 
tissue p16 IHC and RT-qPCR, and to compare the cost of ddPCR with p16 IHC.
METHODS: We prospectively included patients with p16+ oral cavity/oropharyngeal
cancer (OC/OPSCC), and two control groups: p16- OC/OPSCC patients, and healthy
controls undergoing tonsillectomy. All underwent an oropharyngeal swab with ddPCR
for quantitative detection of E6 and E7 mRNA. Surgical specimens had p16 IHC
performed. Agreement between ddPCR and p16 IHC was determined for patients with
p16 positive and negative OC/OPSCC as well as for healthy control patients. The
sensitivity and specificity of ddPCR of oropharyngeal swabs were calculated
against p16 IHC for OPSCC.
RESULTS: 122 patients were included: 36 patients with p16+OPSCC, 16 patients with
p16-OPSCC, 4 patients with p16+OCSCC, 41 patients with p16-OCSCC, and 25 healthy 
controls. The sensitivity and specificity of ddPCR of oropharyngeal swabs against
p16 IHC were 92 and 98% respectively, using 20-50 times less RNA than that
required for conventional RT-qPCR. Overall agreement between ddPCR of tissue
swabs and p16 of tumor tissue was high at ĸ = 0.826 [0.662-0.989].
CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal swabs analyzed by ddPCR is a quantitative, rapid, and
effective method for minimally invasive oncogenic HPV detection. This assay
represents the most sensitive and accurate mode of HPV detection in OPSCC without
a tissue biopsy in the available literature.
