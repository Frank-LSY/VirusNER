The impact of a polymorphism of the wild-type human tumour suppressor gene
p53(wt) on carcinogenesis is subject of controversy ever since a higher
susceptibility of p53 to HPV-E6 mediated degradation when encoding for Arginine
at codon 72 (p53Arg) was first reported. The issue remained unclear because
various studies investigating this question for different tumour entities and
different geographical regions demonstrated diverging results. In the present
study, the HPV status and p53 genotype frequency of 42 head and neck cancers was 
analysed and compared to results reported in the recent literature. Applying PCR 
and cycle sequencing techniques, HPV DNA was demonstrated in 12/42 (29%) of the
cases and the overall distribution of the p53 allele was: 64, 31 and 5% for
p53Arg, p53Arg/Pro and p53Pro, respectively. There was no statistically
significant association between HPV status and p53 genotype distribution. The
results of our study and of the reviewed literature do not support a relevant
role of the p53 polymorphism in head and neck carcinogenesis, either taken alone 
or in association with the HPV status.
