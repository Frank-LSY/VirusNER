BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the prevalence and prognostic
significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) in squamous cell carcinoma of head and
neck (SCCHN) in the Indian population.
AIM: The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPV and p16 in an
Indian cohort of SCCHN and assess their correlation and influence of tobacco use 
on patient outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The p16 and HPV status of 170 patients of SCCHN treated
with curative chemoradiotherapy was determined using immunohistochemistry and
polymerase chain reaction, respectively, and further correlated with their
demographic characteristics. In addition, genotyping of HPV-positive samples was 
performed. Survival outcomes were analyzed and compared for both p16 positive
(p16 +ve) and p16 negative (p16 -ve) population. The influence of tobacco use on 
outcomes was assessed.
RESULTS: p16 expression was observed in 20% (34/170) cases whereas HPV positivity
was detected in 39.4% (67/170) of SCCHN patients with HPV16 being the most common
(91%) subtype. About 73.5% patients were p16 +ve among the tobacco users in this 
cohort (83.5%). Interestingly, p16 positivity was significantly associated with
nonusers of tobacco (P = 0.02) and younger females (P = 0.06). The p16 +ve and
p16 -ve groups did not exhibit a significant difference in the 5-year
cause-specific survival (CSS) (79% vs. 72.2%), disease-free survival (DFS) (78.3%
vs. 68.3%, P = 0.5), and locoregional control (LRC) (82.2% vs. 71.5%, P = 0.4).
However, the outcome analyses in tobacco nonusers revealed a definite large
improvement in CSS (P = 0.08) and a trend toward improvement in DFS (P = 0.15)
and LRC (P = 0.11) in the p16 +ve versus the p16 -ve groups.
CONCLUSION: The low prevalence of p16 positivity (20%) and dual HPV and p16
positivity (38.8%) in the studied Indian cohort indicates the low utility of p16 
as a surrogate for HPV in the background of high tobacco burden. The outcomes are
largely improved in a small subset of SCCHN cases comprising p16 +ve tobacco
nonusers.
