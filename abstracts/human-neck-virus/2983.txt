BACKGROUND: Aseptic meningitis represents a common diagnostic and management
dilemma to clinicians.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical epidemiology, diagnostic evaluations,
management, and outcomes between adults and children with aseptic meningitis.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study from January 2005 through
September 2010 at 9 Memorial Hermann Hospitals in Houston, TX. Patients
age≥2months who presented with community-acquired aseptic meningitis with a CSF
white blood cell count >5cells/mm3 and a negative Gram stain and cultures were
enrolled. Patients with a positive cryptococcal antigen, positive blood cultures,
intracranial masses, brain abscesses, or encephalitis were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 509 patients were included; 404 were adults and 105 were
children. Adults were most likely to be female, Caucasian, immunosuppressed, have
meningeal symptoms (headache, nausea, stiff neck, photophobia) and have a higher 
CSF protein (P <0.05). In contrast, children were more likely to have respiratory
symptoms, fever, and leukocytosis (P <0.05). In 410 (81%) patients, the
etiologies remained unknown. Adults were more likely to be tested for and to have
Herpes simplex virus and West Nile virus while children were more likely to be
tested for and to have Enterovirus (P <0.001). The majority of patients were
admitted (96.5%) with children receiving antibiotic therapy more frequently (P
<0.001) and adults receiving more antiviral therapy (P=0.001). A total of 384
patients (75%) underwent head CT scans and 125 (25%) MRI scans; all were normal
except for meningeal enhancement. All patients had a good clinical outcome at
discharge.
DISCUSSION: Aseptic meningitis in adults and children represent a management
challenge as etiologies remained unknown for the majority of patients due to
underutilization of currently available diagnostic techniques.
