Although in the United States the incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC)
has been significantly higher in men than in women, the identification of human
papilloma virus as a risk factor for OPC has focused new scrutiny on who may
develop OPC. One surprising element is that non-Hispanic white women have a
higher incidence of OPC than of cervical cancer. OPC is thus a woman's disease,
and diligence is needed to ensure that the occurrence of OPC in women does not go
undetected by their oral health care providers.
