Given its epidemic potential and development of severe forms of disease, viral
meningitis (VM) is a serious public health problem.AIM: to characterize the main 
clinical, epidemiologic features, the etiology and treatment of VM cases admitted
to the Iasi Infectious Diseases Hospital, in 2012.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of the
patients admitted for viral meningitis at the Iasi "St. Parascheva" Infectious
Diseases Hospital in the interval January 1- December 31, 2012 (98 cases). The
etiologic diagnosis was made by determining the IgM/IgG antibodies against
Coxsackie virus and/or West Nile virus in blood/CSF.
RESULTS: There was a fourfold increase in the number of cases as compared to the 
average for the years 2009-2011. Most cases (73.5%) were children aged 1 to 14
years. 61.8% of patients were males, 51.7% from urban areas. The most common
symptom was headache (85.7%), followed by fever (77.6%), and vomiting (66.3%).
Neck stiffness was absent in 28.6% cases. In43.5% of the 39 patients
serologically investigated a Coxsackie virus infection was confirmed and 1/20 was
positive for West Nile virus; three varicella-zoster virus infections and one
mumps infection were diagnosed clinically. 68.3% of the patients received
first-line antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The illness mainly affected children, fever and neck stiffness being
sometimes absent. The etiology was known in 22.4% of cases; enter viruses being
the most frequent causative agent. Most patients received antibiotic therapy. The
course was favorable in all cases.
