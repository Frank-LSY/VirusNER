Objective:To investigate the relationship between different subtypes of human
papillomavirus(HPV) infection and clinical features in juvenile onset recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis(JORRP) patients. Method:Two hundred and forty cases
with JORRP from 2010 to 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. HPV tpye were
determined using tumor specimens taken from surgery, and all patients were
divided into different groups based on HPV type. Clinical characteristics of
patients from each groups were analyzed. Result:Except for HPV11 single infection
or HPV6 single infection, some HPV11 and 6 co-infections were found in children
with JORRP. Compared with patients with HPV6 single infection, HPV11 positive
patients present an earlier age of onset, more times of operation and higher
derkay score during surgery.Conclusion:JORRP in patients infected with HPV11 is
more severe than that in patients with HPV6 infection in children.
