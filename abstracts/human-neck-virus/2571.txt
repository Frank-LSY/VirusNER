Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common solid
cancers worldwide. It is mainly caused by exposure to tobacco smoke and alcohol
as well as infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). The prognosis is poor,
especially once it recurs or metastasizes. Current therapeutic options include
surgery, radio- and chemotherapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors are so far the only targeted agents that have been approved in head
and neck cancer. Primary or secondary resistance is frequent or will eventually
develop. Several driver mutations and other genomic aberrations have been
described in HNSCC including EGFR overexpression and amplification. Yet, no
predictive biomarkers for the application of EGFR inhibitors have been
identified. Further targeted agents are in development for HNSCC, of which
inhibitors of the PI3K pathway are the closest to clinical application. In recent
years, the incidence of HPV-driven HNSCC has risen in Western countries.
HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC are distinct molecular tumor entities, and
consequences for targeted therapies have been discussed. This review looks at
approved and investigational targeted treatment strategies as well as potential
predictive biomarkers such as the HPV status to guide treatment.
