A growing subgroup of oropharyngeal cancers is initiated by infection with
high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). In parallel to mounting epidemiological 
evidence, solid experimental data support a causal association between HPV and a 
subset of oropharyngeal cancers. This Review summarizes the main events of the
HPV life cycle, the functions of the viral oncoproteins, and the implications of 
HPV infection on their hosts, with an emphasis on carcinogenic mechanisms in
oropharyngeal cancer. The demonstration that HPVs have a role in head and neck
carcinogenesis has fuelled the expectation that HPV-targeted therapeutic
strategies may prove curative in these cancers.
