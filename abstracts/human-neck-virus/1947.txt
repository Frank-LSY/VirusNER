BACKGROUND: We performed a pilot study using Trojan vaccines in patients with
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). These vaccines are
composed of HLA-I and HLA-II restricted melanoma antigen E (MAGE)-A3 or human
papillomavirus (HPV)-16 derived peptides, joined by furin-cleavable linkers, and 
linked to a "penetrin" peptide sequence derived from HIV-TAT. Thirty-one patients
with SCCHN were screened for the trial and 5 were enrolled.
METHODS: Enrolled patients were treated with 300 μg of Trojan peptide
supplemented with Montanide and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) at 4-week intervals for up to 4 injections.
RESULTS: Following vaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4
of 5 patients recognized both the full Trojan constructs and constituent HLA-II
peptides, whereas responses to HLA-I restricted peptides were less pronounced.
CONCLUSION: This treatment regimen seems to have acceptable toxicity and elicits 
measurable systemic immune responses against HLA-II restricted epitopes in a
subset of patients with advanced SCCHN.
