Recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer describes tumor deposits that arise 
locally, regionally, or at distant sites after treatment or distant metastases at
the time of primary diagnosis. Prognosis for R/M squamous cell carcinomas of the 
head and neck (HNSCC) is poor and treatment options are limited in this
situation. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important risk factor for HNSCC.
About 40 % of all HNSCC have been attributed to HPV in Europe. HPV positivity at 
initial diagnosis is the single best prognostic factor for survival. However,
data for the prognostic and predictive value of HPV in the R/M situation are
still scarce. Due to the rising incidence of HPV-associated cancers, the number
of R/M HPV+ carcinomas is also expected to rise. This chapter therefore aims to
give an overview of the current knowledge concerning the role of HPV as a
prognostic and predictive marker in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.
