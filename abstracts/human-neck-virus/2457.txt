The role of Human papillomavirus (HPV) in malignant and non-malignant genital
diseases in females is well known and the corresponding epidemiological burden
has been widely described, in males instead, less is known about the role of the 
virus in anal, penile and head and neck cancer, and the burden of malignant and
non-malignant HPV-related diseases. There are many types of HPV that can infect
the epithelium: some types can cause genital warts (low risk genotype), other
types (high risk genotypes) can cause cancers of the penis, anus or oropharynx.
Relative to females, males tend to be less knowledgeable about the infection:
some may view its consequences as less likely and severe for themselves than for 
females, and thus could perceive vaccination as unnecessary. Including boys in
the vaccination program generally exceeded conventional thresholds of good value 
for money, even under favorable conditions of vaccine protection and health
benefits; however, uncertainty still exists in many areas that can either
strengthen or attenuate the findings achieved.
