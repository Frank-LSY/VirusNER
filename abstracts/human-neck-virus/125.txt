In recent years it has been well established that two major constituent parts of 
the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-the proteasome holoenzymes and a number of 
ubiquitin ligases-play a crucial role, not only in virus replication but also in 
the regulation of the immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1). However, the role in HIV-1 replication of the third major component, the
deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), has remained largely unknown. In this study, we 
show that the DUB-inhibitors (DIs) P22077 and PR-619, specific for the DUBs USP7 
and USP47, impair Gag processing and thereby reduce the infectivity of released
virions without affecting viral protease activity. Furthermore, the replication
capacity of X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1NL4-3 in human lymphatic tissue is decreased
upon treatment with these inhibitors without affecting cell viability. Most
strikingly, combinatory treatment with DIs and proteasome inhibitors
synergistically blocks virus replication at concentrations where mono-treatment
was ineffective, indicating that DIs can boost the therapeutic effect of
proteasome inhibitors. In addition, P22077 and PR-619 increase the
polyubiquitination of Gag and thus its entry into the UPS and the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I pathway. In summary, our data point towards a 
model in which specific inhibitors of DUBs not only interfere with virus spread
but also increase the immune recognition of HIV-1 expressing cells.
