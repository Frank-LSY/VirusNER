We report the case of a 77-year-old non-smoker and non-drinker with a solid-organ
transplant who had malignant transformation of respiratory papillomatosis 3 years
after the initial diagnosis of this benign lesion. This is the first case
reported in the literature of malignant transformation of respiratory
papillomatosis in a solid-organ transplant patient. Virus-associated cutaneous
cancers occur more frequently and aggressively in solid-organ transplant
patients. There may be a higher rate of malignant transformation of respiratory
papillomatosis in immunosuppressed patients, as this is a virus-associated
disease. Closer observation, airway evaluation with laryngoscopy and
tracheobronchoscopy, and interval biopsies of immunosuppressed patients with
respiratory papillomatosis is recommended.
