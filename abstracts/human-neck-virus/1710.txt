Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related malignancy 
in which the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tumor progression.
Here, we developed two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse lines from engrafted
NPC metastatic tumors. Positive staining for EBV-encoded small RNAs confirmed
that these tumors harbored EBV, and gene expression profile analyses further
showed that the PDX was highly similar to the primary parent tumor. In vivo drug 
screening using the PDX system demonstrated that gemcitabine had the best
antitumor effect among the tested drugs. The donor of this PDX also showed
excellent responsiveness to gemcitabine treatment. The combination of gemcitabine
and valproic acid exerted synergistic antitumor effects. Further addition of
ganciclovir to this two-drug combination regimen enhanced cytolytic viral
activation, yielding the best antitumor response among tested regimens. Treatment
with this three-drug combination regimen decreased plasma EBV-DNA load, tumor
viral concentration, and the number of viable tumor cells to a greater extent
than the two-drug gemcitabine and valproic acid combination. These results
highlight the value of PDX models in the development of EBV-targeted strategies
to treat NPC.
