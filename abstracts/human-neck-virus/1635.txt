BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that the seventh edition of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC/UICC)
TNM staging system does not consistently distinguish between prognostic subgroups
for human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC). The eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system came into effect 
for use with HPV-mediated OPSCC on or after 1 January 2017. This study confirms
that the eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system for HPV-mediated
OPSCC accurately reflects disease outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 195 patients with OPSCC treated
at Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan between 1998 and 2015. HPV status
was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of p16.
RESULTS: Of the 195 OPSCC patients evaluated, 111 (56.9%) were p16 positive and
84 (43.1%) were p16 negative. The 3-year overall survival rate (OS) was
significantly lower in the p16-negative patients with stage III-IV in comparison 
with those with stage I-II (55.0 vs. 93.1%, respectively; p < 0.01). The 3-year
OS did not differ significantly between stage I-II and stage III-IV in the
p16-positive patients (86.7 vs 87.7%). According to the eighth edition of the
AJCC/UICC TNM staging system, stage I-II and stage III can be differentiated on
the basis of the 3-year OS in the p16-positive patients (90.9 vs 70.2%,
respectively; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system is suitable 
for use with p16-negative patients; however, it does not effectively discriminate
between p16-positive patients. Therefore, the eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM
staging system is more suitable for HPV-mediated OPSCC in Japan.
