PURPOSE: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relatively good
prognosis of patients with a human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and one of these is a higher sensitivity to
(chemo)radiation. Previous studies have suggested that treatment failure in OPSCC
patients is caused by resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the association between the number of CSCs and prognosis in
HPV-positive OPSCC patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: All OPSCC patients (n=711) treated between 2000 and 2006 in 
two Dutch university hospitals were included. Presence of HPV in a tumour tissue 
specimen was tested by p16-immunostaining followed by HPV DNA GP5+/6+polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). The presence and intensity of tumour CSC markers CD44 and
CD98 were determined by immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative scoring was
performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were
compared between patients with low and high CD44/CD98 expression in relation to
HPV status.
RESULTS: HPV-positive tumours showed a lower percentage of cells with CD44 and
CD98 expression than HPV-negative tumours (p<0.001, χ(2)-test). Within the group 
of patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, a high percentage of CD98-positive tumour
cells was associated with a significantly worse 5-year OS and PFS (OS: 36.4% and 
PFS: 27.3%) compared to patients with a low percentage of CD98-positive cells
(OS: 71.9% and PFS: 70.5%, respectively) (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV-positive OPSCCs harbour fewer cells expressing the CSC
enrichment markers CD44 and CD98. Furthermore, OS and PFS were significantly
worse for patients with HPV-positive OPSCC with a high percentage of
CD98-positive cells.
