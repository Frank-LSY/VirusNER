We found no difference between pediatric and adult patients in terms of their sex distribution (p > .05).Type III, undifferentiated carcinoma is the most common subtype in Pediatric patients, while adult patients had more squamous cell tumors (p < .01). Pediatric patients were more likely to present with stage IV disease (p <  .05). Of the 353 patients, 120 (34.0%) had only one presenting symptom initially; however, most patients presented two or more episodes. Neck mass was the most common presenting symptom initially in children and adolescents, while multiple ear symptoms in adult patients (p = .003). The median time from onset of the presenting symptom to diagnosis is three months, adult patient presented longer history (64.7% vs 44.55, p < .05). Of the 319 adult patients, there were 142 which the time from onset of the presenting symptom to diagnosis is less than 3 months and there were 177 more than 3 months, the difference was significant between the two groups (p < .05). There were no differences in the misdiagnosis rate between pediatric and adult (35.1 vs 31.0, p > .05). Among pediatric patients, 31 (91.2%) had positive EBV DNA in peripheral plasma. EBV DNA was significantly associated with stage (p < .05).
