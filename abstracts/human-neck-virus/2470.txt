OBJECTIVE/REVIEW QUESTIONS: The objective of this systematic review is to
synthesize the best available evidence regarding the oncological and survival
outcomes (as measured by disease control, disease-free survival, disease-specific
survival and overall survival) of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) versus
transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma in adults (aged 18 years or older). Specifically the review
questions are:1 Is there a difference in oncological outcomes between a
traditional "Halstedian" en bloc tumor resection technique used in TORS versus a 
modern segmental tumor dissection technique used in TLM?2 Does one surgical
approach confer better oncological outcomes with respect to a particular patient 
subgroup, such as patients with a positive human papilloma virus status or
patient's with different tumor T-stages?
