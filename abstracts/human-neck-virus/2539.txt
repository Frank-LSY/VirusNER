Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common malignancy that
continues to be difficult to treat and cure. In many organ systems and tumor
types, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the molecular
basis for tumorigenesis, disease progression and genetic implications for
therapeutics. Although tumorigenesis pathways and the molecular etiologies of
HNSCC have been extensively studied, there are still very few diagnostic clinical
applications used in practice today. This review discusses current clinically
applicable molecular markers, including viral detection of Epstein-Barr virus and
human papillomavirus, and molecular targets that are used in diagnosis and
management of HNSCC. The common oncogenes EGFR, RAS, CCND1, BRAF, and PIK3CA and 
tumor suppressor genes p53, CDKN2A and NOTCH are discussed for their associations
with HNSCC. Discussion of markers with potential future applications is also
included, with a focus on molecular alterations associated with targeted therapy 
resistance.
