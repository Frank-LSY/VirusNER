Squamous cell carcinomas are the most frequent subgroup among head and neck
malignant tumors (HNSCC). Tobacco (±alcohol) and HPV infection, the two main risk
factors, define two entities with distinct anatomo-clinical and genetic features.
HPV-positive, non-tobacco-related HNSCCs are associated with a better prognosis, 
a rather simple genomic profile, frequent activating mutations of genes involved 
in pi3kinase-pathway, and the scarcity of mutations of tumor suppressor genes.
HPV-negative, tobacco-related HNSCC are genetically more complex, are
characterized by almost mandatory inactivating mutations/deletions of tumor
suppressor genes (TP53, CDKN2A) and the possible, but less frequent, activating
mutations or amplifications of some oncogenes that encode for cell cycle proteins
or receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. This review describes the genetic
features of HNSCC and discusses how these abnormalities could be incorporated
into a therapeutic approach.
