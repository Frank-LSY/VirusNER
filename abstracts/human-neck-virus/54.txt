OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, genotypes, and prognostic values of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in Japanese
patients with different types of head and neck cancer (HNC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: HPV and EBV DNA, EBV genotypes and LMP-1 variants, and HPV
mRNA expression were detected by PCR from fresh-frozen HNC samples. HPV genotypes
were determined by direct sequencing, and EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was examined by 
in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: Of the 209 HNC patients, 63 (30.1%) had HPV infection, and HPV-16 was
the most common subtype (86.9%). HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression was found in 23 of 60 
(38.3%) HPV DNA-positive cases detected. The site of highest prevalence of HPV
was the oropharynx (45.9%). Among 146 (69.9%) HNCs in which EBV DNA was
identified, 107 (73.3%) and 27 (18.5%) contained types A and B, respectively, and
124 (84.9%) showed the existence of del-LMP-1. However, only 13 (6.2%) HNCs were 
positive for EBER, 12 (92.3%) of which derived from the nasopharynx. Co-infection
of HPV and EBER was found in only 1.0% of HNCs and 10.0% of NPCs. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis showed significantly better disease-specific and overall
survival in the HPV DNA+/mRNA+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC)
patients than in the other OPC patients (P = 0.027 and 0.017, respectively).
Multivariate analysis showed that stage T1-3 (P = 0.002) and HPV mRNA-positive
status (P = 0.061) independently predicted better disease-specific survival. No
significant difference in disease-specific survival was found between the
EBER-positive and -negative NPC patients (P = 0.155).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that co-infection with HPV and EBV is rare in 
HNC. Oropharyngeal SCC with active HPV infection was related to a highly
favorable outcome, while EBV status was not prognostic in the NPC cohort.
