BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate oncologic outcomes of head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with transoral robotic surgery
(TORS) based on human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking risk factors.
METHODS: Fifty-five patients with HNSCC treated with TORS, neck dissection, +/-
adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed
based on HPV and smoking status.
RESULTS: Smokers and nonsmokers had locoregional control rates of 96.3% and 94.4%
(p = .66) and progression-free survival rates 83% and 94.1% (p = .09),
respectively. HPV-negative and HPV-positive patients had locoregional control
rates of 87.1% and 100% (p = .03) and progression-free survival rates of 74.2%
and 95.2% (p = .01), respectively. Locoregional control rates for HPV-negative
smokers, HPV-negative nonsmokers, HPV-positive smokers, and HPV-positive
nonsmokers were 90.9%, 80.0%, 100%, and 100% (p = .18), whereas progression-free 
survival rates were 72.2%, 80.0%, 92.3%, and 100% (p = .04), respectively.
CONCLUSION: HPV status may be more important than smoking status in determining
the risk of disease recurrence and death in patients treated with TORS.
