Attenuated strain TTVAC7, as a multi-gene-deleted vaccinia virus Tiantan strain
(VTT), was constructed by knocking out parts of non-essential genes related to
virulence, host range and immunomodulation of VTT, and by combining double marker
screening with exogenous selectable marker knockout techniques. In this study,
shuttle vector plasmids pTC-EGFP, pTA35-EGFP, pTA66-EGFP, pTE-EGFP, pTB-EGFP,
pTI-EGFP and pTJ-EGFP were constructed, which contained seven pairs of
recombinant arms linked to the early and late strong promoter pE/L, as well as to
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as an exogenous selectable marker. BHK 
cells were co-transfected/infected successively with the above plasmids and VTT
or gene-deleted VTT, and homologous recombination and fluorescence plaque
screening methods were used to knock out the gene fragments (TC: TC7L ∼ TK2L;
TA35: TA35L; TA66: TA66R; TE: TE3L ∼ TE4L; TB: TB13R; TI: TI4L; TJ: TJ2R). The
Cre/LoxP system was then applied to knock out the exogenous selectable marker,
and ultimately the gene-deleted attenuated strain TTVAC7 was obtained. A series
of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that not only the host range of 
TTVAC7 could be narrowed and its toxicity weakened significantly, but its high
immunogenicity was maintained at the same time. These results support the
potential of TTVAC7 to be developed as a safe viral vector or vaccine.
