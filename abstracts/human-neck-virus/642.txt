The incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma is increasing in many countries of the developed world, largely because of cancers caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-positive patients may ask questions that fall outside the remit of traditional consultations held in head and neck clinics. The purpose of this article is to highlight key messages about HPV and oropharyngeal cancer that are relevant to patients. Key messages include: HPV is a very common virus that transiently infects most people at some point in their lives; HPV infection is transmitted by normal sexual activity and is not a marker of promiscuity or abnormal sexual practices; HPV infections may be acquired many years before a cancer develops and infection does not imply recent infidelity; long-term partners of HPV-positive patients do not seem to be at increased risk of HPV infection.
