Because of the common shared risk factors of smoking and heavy alcohol
consumption, literature involving oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)
is often combined with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Human papilloma virus is now
confirmed to be a major risk factor of OPSCC with its distinct epidemiology and
favorable treatment outcome. The impact of adjuvant chemoradiation in the setting
of positive surgical margins remains unclear but is likely influenced by tumor
biology. This article reviews the tumor biology of OPSCC and summarizes recent
findings on outcomes following surgical treatment of OPSCC.
