PURPOSE: Poorer survival from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in
African Americans (AA) may be due to disparity in the prevalence of Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) but earlier studies often failed to control other
etiological factors. We aimed to elucidate whether racial disparities in HPV
prevalence and overall survival were due to confounding from smoking or alcohol
use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 385 patients with SCC of the mouth, pharynx, nose, or
larynx who had surgical resection at Wayne State University affiliated hospitals 
were identified through a population-based cancer registry. Formalin fixed
paraffin embedded tissue blocks were used to determine the presence of HPV DNA
and its genotype using a sensitive broad-spectrum PCR technique. Patients'
demographics, tumor characteristics and vital status were obtained through record
linkage with the registry data and smoking and alcohol information was abstracted
from medical record. Cox's proportional hazard model and unconditional logistic
regression models were employed to analyze the overall survival and tumor
HPV-positivity, respectively.
RESULTS: HPV positivity in oropharyngeal cancer was substantially lower in AA
than in other racial groups (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.05-0.37) and adjustment for smoking or alcohol did not change this association.
However, a significantly increased hazard ratio of death in AA oropharyngeal
cancer patients (univariable hazard ratio (HR) 2.55, 95% CI 1.42-4.59) decreased 
to almost unity (HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.75-2.93) after adjustment for HPV and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower HPV prevalence in AA largely accounts for their poorer
survival from oropharyngeal cancer, but not other HNSSC.
