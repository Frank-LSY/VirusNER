BACKGROUND: The combined effects of Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Herpes simplex
type 1 (HSV-1) infections and their effects on cancer cell radioresistance are
unexplored.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An HPV16-positive hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line
(UD-SCC-2) was infected with wt-HSV-1 at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and 
irradiated with 2 Gy at 24 h postinfection. Viability assays and quantitative
reverse-transcriptase PCR for HPV16 E6, E7, nuclear factor kappa B1, B-cell
CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and caspases 3, 8 and 9 at 24, and 72 h, as well as
immunocytochemistry for BCL2, caspase 3, cyclin E, mouse double minute 2 homolog 
(MDM2), HSV-1 and Ki-67 were performed at 144 h postirradiation.
RESULTS: At 144 h, cell viability was significantly lowered by irradiation only
in uninfected cells. Infection combined with irradiation resulted in increased
expression of E6, E7, BCL2 and NF-κB1 at 144 h. Simultaneously, E6 and E7 were
down-regulated in non-irradiated infected cells. Irradiation and infection with
0.00001 MOI separately up-regulated caspase 3 but infection with 0.0001 MOI
halved its expression in irradiated cells.
CONCLUSION: HSV-1 infection modulates radioresistance of HPV16-positive
hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
