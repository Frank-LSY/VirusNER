We analyzed 64 patients for HPV ISH and 65 for p16. Eleven tumors (17%) were HPV+, 12 (18%) were p16+, whereas 52 (80%) were both HPV- and p16-. The objective response rate was 55% for HPV-positive versus 19% for HPV-negative (P = 0.022), and 50% for p16-positive versus 19% for p16-negative (P = 0.057). The median survival was 12.9 versus 6.7 months for HPV-positive versus HPV-negative patients (P = 0.014), and 11.9 versus 6.7 months for p16-positive versus p16-negative patients (P = 0.027). After adjusting for other covariates, hazard ratio for OS was 2.69 (P = 0.048) and 2.17 (P = 0.10), favoring HPV-positive and p16-positive patients, respectively. The other unfavorable risk factor for OS was loss of â‰¥5% weight in previous 6 months (P = 0.0021 and 0.023 for HPV and p16 models, respectively).
