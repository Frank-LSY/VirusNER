BACKGROUND: An increasing proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas
(OPSCCs) is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection. Several
authors have suggested that HR-HPV DNA could be used as a marker of metastases in
cervical cancers. Although HPV16 DNA has been detected in neck lymph node (LN)
metastases of HPV16-positive OPSCC, its significance remains controversial. Does 
this presence correlate to metastatic involvement or is it just the consequence
of LN filter function?
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyse the relationship between HPV16 detection
in neck LNs of HPV16-positive OPSCC and their pathological status.
STUDY DESIGN: HP16-viral load (VL) was quantified by real-time-polymerase-chain
reaction in primary tumours and neck LNs, in 11 patients with HPV16-positive
OPSCC and in three patients with HPV16-negative OPSCC. HPV16 in situ
hybridisation and p16 immunohistochemistry were performed in all LNs.
RESULTS: A total of 45 LN levels were assessed. HPV16 DNA was not identified in
HPV16-negative OPSCC LNs. All metastatic LNs from HPV16-positive OPSCC had a high
VL and the viral DNA was located within tumoural cells. Among 27 pathologically
tumour-free LN (PTFLN) levels 16/27 had no detectable VL, whereas the VL was low 
or medium (<10(5)copies/million cells) in 8/27 and high (>10(5)copies/million
cells) in 3/27 PTFLN. In the latter group, no metastatic cell was identified and 
the viral DNA was located in immune cells.
CONCLUSION: HPV16 detection in LN is explained by its presence within either
metastatic cells or immune cells. HPV16 detection in PTFLN is not necessarily
correlated to occult LN metastases.
