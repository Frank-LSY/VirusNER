OBJECTIVES: A subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) is infected
with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). The object of this study is to
evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1, an oral 5-fluorouracil
prodrug, on survival of patients with OPC according to HPV status.
METHODS: Among OPC patients of stage III or IV who received definitive treatment 
from 1998 to 2008, 38 who were confirmed tumor-free after primary treatment were 
analyzed. Before 2003, none of the patients received S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy
(S-1(-)-group); however, all patients who were eligible were administered S-1
(S-1(+)-group) after 2003. The expression of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) involved
in 5-FU metabolism was also examined in protein and mRNA levels.
RESULTS: Although there was a trend to disease-free and overall survival benefit 
in HPV-negative patients with S-1, it did not achieve statistical significance
(P=.082 and P=.065, respectively). For the HPV-positive patients, the survivals
were similar with or without S-1 administration. TYMS-expression in HPV-positive 
OPC tissues was significantly higher than in HPV-negative ones in both protein
and mRNA levels (P=.0489 and P=.0446, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The current study provides a rationale to plan a randomized trial to 
compare the efficacy of S-1 according to the HPV status in OPCs.
