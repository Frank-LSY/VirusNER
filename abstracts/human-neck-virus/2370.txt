BACKGROUND: Treatment of sinonasal bacterial biofilms continues to be a challenge
in modern rhinology. This study's objective was to assess the safety and efficacy
of topically applied Cocktail of S. aureus specific phage (CTSA) alone and in
combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for treatment of
Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vivo.
METHODS: Using a sheep model of sinusitis, frontal sinuses (n = 6 per treatment) 
were flushed once daily with a CTSA (2 × 10(6) plaque forming units [PFU]/mL),
with or without EDTA (0.075 mg/mL), and compared to a control flush containing
saline and heat-inactivated CTSA. Safety was assessed using histology and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after treatment for 3 days. Efficacy was
assessed by quantifying the generation of S. aureus biofilms in the frontal
sinuses after 5 days of treatment. Biofilm mass was compared between treatment
groups and controls using LIVE/DEAD BacLight staining and confocal scanning laser
microscopy to visualize the tissue sections. COMSTAT2 software was used to
compute the biofilm mass present on tissue sections.
RESULTS: Tissue morphology was conserved, with no significant signs of
inflammation, when comparing control and test treatments. Furthermore, SEM
analysis indicated test treatments were not toxic or damaging to mucosal cilia.
COMSTAT2 quantification of biofilm showed a significant reduction in biofilm
levels when comparing the control with CTSA (p = 0.0043), EDTA (p = 0.0095), and 
CTSA-EDTA (p = 0.0022) treatments.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that CTSA and EDTA are safe and efficacious for
short-term topical application against S. aureus infection in a sheep sinusitis
model, and have the potential to be translated to a clinical setting.
