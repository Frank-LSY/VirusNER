BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now known to cause a significant
proportion of head and neck cancers (HNC). Qualitative research has shown that
some health professionals find it difficult to discuss HPV with patients due to
its sexually transmitted nature, and have concerns about their own knowledge of
the virus. We used a survey to quantify attitudes towards discussing HPV among
HNC health professionals.
METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional survey of HNC health professionals
(n=260) in the UK and Ireland, assessing participants' knowledge of HPV, their
experiences of and attitudes towards discussing HPV with patients, and their
willingness to discuss HPV with their patients in the future.
RESULTS: Overall, health professionals had good knowledge of HPV (mean score:
9.97 out of 12). Oncologists had significantly greater knowledge than specialist 
nurses, speech and language therapists and 'other' health professionals. Most
were willing to discuss HPV with patients (mean=4.3 out of 5). Willingness to
discuss HPV in the future was associated with higher HPV knowledge (r=0.35,
p<0.001), fewer negative and more positive attitudes towards discussing HPV
(r=-0.23 and r=0.20 respectively, both p<0.001), fewer personal barriers
(r=-0.49, p<0.001) and greater confidence (r=0.58, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Knowledge, experiences and attitudes to discussing HPV varied across 
HNC health professionals. Addressing gaps in health professionals' HPV knowledge 
and improving their confidence in discussing HPV with patients may increase their
willingness to have such conversations. This may help minimise the negative
psychosocial consequences of an HPV diagnosis in this patient group.
