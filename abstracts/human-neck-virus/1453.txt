BACKGROUND: Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, disrupt normal cell
function, thus contributing to multiple steps of carcinogenesis. Nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in southern China and is highly associated with
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Significant changes of the host cell
methylome are observed in EBV-associated NPC with cancer development. Epigenetic 
marks for NPC diagnosis are urgently needed. In order to explore DNA methylation 
marks, we investigated DNA methylation of candidate genes in EBV-associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: We first employed methyl-capture sequencing and cDNA microarrays to
compare the genome-wide methylation profiles of seven NPC tissues and five
non-cancer nasopharyngeal epithelium (NNE) tissues. We found 150 hypermethylated 
CpG islands spanning promoter regions and down-regulated genes. Furthermore, we
quantified the methylation rates of seven candidate genes using bisulfite
amplicon sequencing for nine NPC and nine NNE tissues.
RESULTS: All seven candidate genes showed significantly higher methylation rates 
in NPC than in NNE tissues, and the ratios (NPC/NNE) were in descending order as 
follows: ITGA4 > RERG > ZNF671 > SHISA3 > ZNF549 > CR2 > RRAD. In particular,
methylation levels of ITGA4, RERG, and ZNF671 could distinguish NPC patients from
NNE subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the DNA methylation rates of previously unidentified
NPC candidate genes. The combination of genome-wide and targeted methylation
profiling by next-generation sequencers should provide useful information
regarding cancer-specific aberrant methylation.
