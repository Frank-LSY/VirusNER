Gene therapy is defined as the treatment of disease by transfer of genetic
material into cells. This review will explore methods available for gene transfer
as well as current and potential applications for craniofacial regeneration, with
emphasis on future development and design. Though non-viral gene delivery methods
are limited by low gene transfer efficiency, they benefit from relative safety,
low immunogenicity, ease of manufacture, and lack of DNA insert size limitation. 
In contrast, viral vectors are nature's gene delivery machines that can be
optimized to allow for tissue-specific targeting, site-specific chromosomal
integration, and efficient long-term infection of dividing and non-dividing
cells. In contrast to traditional replacement gene therapy, craniofacial
regeneration seeks to use genetic vectors as supplemental building blocks for
tissue growth and repair. Synergistic combination of viral gene therapy with
craniofacial tissue engineering will significantly enhance our ability to repair 
and replace tissues in vivo.
