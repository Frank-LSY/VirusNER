OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationships between CD163 expression, localization of
CD163+ macrophages, clinicopathological features and prognosis of NPC.
METHODS: A total of 110 cases of NPC specimens and 80 cases of nasopharyngitis
specimens were analysed for CD163 expression by immunohistochemistry and EBERs
expression in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: CD163 + macrophages in the tumour stroma were positively correlated with
the tumour and nodal stage. Higher expression of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs 
(EBERs) in the nuclei of tumour cells was associated with higher density of
CD163 + macrophages in the tumour stroma. More importantly, greater infiltration 
of CD163 + macrophages in the tumour stroma was associated with poor overall
survival (OS) and poor progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis
revealed that the density of CD163+ macrophages in the tumour stroma may be an
independent risk factor for NPC prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased infiltration of CD163+ macrophages in the tumour stroma
correlates with worse outcomes and with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection status
of tumour cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
