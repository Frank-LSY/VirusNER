Pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness is considered a variant of Guillain-Barré
syndrome with limited oropharyngeal, neck, and upper limb muscle involvement. The
authors report on a 7-year-old boy, who developed pharyngeal-cervical-brachial
type of Guillain-Barré syndrome following an antecedent episode of acute
hepatitis A virus infection, 2 weeks prior to admission. The presentation was
characterized by acute onset dysphagia, loss of head control, and bilateral arm
weakness. The diagnosis was confirmed by acute motor axonal changes in the arm
and albuminocytologic dissociation of the cerebrospinal fluid. The child was
treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in gradual improvement
over 3 weeks. Documented instances of this form of Guillain-Barré syndrome remain
rare in the pediatric age group, with none existing following antecedent
hepatitis A virus infection. The authors emphasize that acute hepatitis A virus
infection be included in the triggers responsible for Guillain-Barré syndrome in 
children.
