BACKGROUND: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a rare genodermatosis
characterized by a unique susceptibility to cutaneous human papillomaviruses
infection. Most patients show autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of two sisters with clinically
epidermodysplasia verruciformis specific lesions on the face, neck, trunk, and
extremities. PCR analysis indicated the presence of human papillomavirus type 5
in the lesions. Electron microscopic examination showed viral-like particles in
keratinocyte nuclei and the stratum corneum of the epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions. In addition, we examined the EVER1 and EVER2 genes using
eight different primer pairs without finding any nonsense or frameshift mutations
in the gDNA from lymphocytes of the elder sister.
CONCLUSIONS: In this report, the patient's parents did not have epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions or a consanguineous marriage. EV did not develop in the
elder sister until five years of age, so the parents did not perceive EV as an
inherited disease. The probability that EV developed in both sisters was only
6.25%. Thus, it is rare for both sisters to develop epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions considering that the parents were presumed to be carriers
and the disease reveal an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
