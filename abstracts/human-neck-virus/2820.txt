Worldwide, tonsillitis is very common. The most common etiology is
cross-infection with bacteria and viruses. These cases are managed with
antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs without any further investigation because
the diagnosis is based on simple clinical examination. Usually, leukemia presents
with bleeding, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, fever, and frequent infection.
Tonsillitis is a rare first presentation of leukemia. We present 3 cases in which
the diagnosis of leukemia was made on routine examination, and in 1 case
diagnosis was suspected during tonsillectomy.
