OBJECTIVES: The increasing incidence of HPV-related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell
Carcinoma (OPSCC) and the improved survival of HPV-positive OPSCC highlight the
need for effective tools in evaluating HPV status on formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancers. To date, there is no agreement regarding the
most appropriate method for HPV testing on FFPE materials. We aimed to
investigate the performance of the Xpert® HPV assay (Cepheid) on crude lysates
from OPSCC FFPE tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crude lysates were obtained by proteinase K digestion of
FFPE tissues that had already been analyzed by the INNO-LiPA HPV assay and
p16ink4a immunostaining.
RESULTS: 159 FFPE OPSCCs were evaluated. All the samples provided valid results
with the Xpert, whereas three samples (1.8%) were invalid using the INNO-LiPA.
Among the remaining 156 cases, 65 (41.7%) were concordantly positive and 87
(55.8%) concordantly negative (raw agreement 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99; Cohen K
0.95, 95% CI: 0.90-0.99). Type-specific data for the cases that were positive by 
both methods were completely concordant. Three samples were HPV16-positive with
Xpert but negative with INNO-LiPA, while one OPSCC tested negative with Xpert and
positive with INNO-LiPA. A very good agreement was observed between the Xpert and
the p16 results, which was slightly higher than that for INNO-LiPA (Cohen K
0.87vs. 0.85).
CONCLUSION: The Xpert HPV assay appears to be a very good method for HPV
detection and genotyping on FFPE OPSCCs, and requires no prior purification of
nucleic acids. This assay showed a very good agreement with INNO-LiPA and p16
findings.
