Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative agents in almost all cervical
carcinomas. HPVs are also causative agents in head and neck cancer, the cases of 
which are increasing rapidly. Viral replication activates the DNA damage response
(DDR) pathway; associated proteins are recruited to replication foci, and this
pathway may serve to allow for viral genome amplification. Likewise, HPV genome
double-strand breaks (DSBs) could be produced during replication and could lead
to linearization and viral integration. Many studies have shown that viral
integration into the host genome results in unregulated expression of the viral
oncogenes, E6 and E7, promoting HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Previously, we have
demonstrated that DNA-damaging agents, such as etoposide, or knocking down viral 
replication partner proteins, such as topoisomerase II Î² binding protein I
(TopBP1), does not reduce the level of DNA replication. Here, we investigated
whether these treatments alter the quality of DNA replication by HPV16 E1 and E2.
We confirm that knockdown of TopBP1 or treatment with etoposide does not reduce
total levels of E1/E2-mediated DNA replication; however, the quality of
replication is significantly reduced. The results demonstrate that E1 and E2
continue to replicate under genomically-stressed conditions and that this
replication is mutagenic. This mutagenesis would promote the formation of
substrates for integration of the viral genome into that of the host, a hallmark 
of cervical cancer.
