OBJECTIVE: This study investigated long-term survival outcomes in surgically
treated oropharyngeal cancer patients with known human papilloma virus status.
METHODS: A case note review was performed of all patients undergoing primary
surgery for oropharyngeal cancer in a single centre over a 10-year period. Human 
papilloma virus status was determined via dual modality testing. Associations
between clinicopathological variables and survival were identified using a
log-rank test.
RESULTS: Of the 107 cases in the study, 40 per cent (n = 41) were human papilloma
virus positive. The positive and negative predictive values of p16
immunohistochemistry for human papilloma virus status were 57 per cent and 100
per cent, respectively. At a mean follow up of 59.5 months, 5-year overall and
disease-specific survival estimates were 78 per cent and 69 per cent,
respectively. Human papilloma virus status (p = 0.014), smoking status (p =
0.021) and tumour stage (p = 0.03) were significant prognostic indicators.
CONCLUSION: The long-term survival rates in surgically treated oropharyngeal
cancer patients were comparable to other studies. Variables including human
papilloma virus status and tumour stage were associated with survival in patients
treated with primary surgery; however, nodal stage and presence of extracapsular 
spread were non-prognostic.
