BACKGROUND/AIM: Elderly patients with HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) represent
an understudied cohort of the HPV epidemic. We aimed to investigate the clinical 
presentation, treatment tolerability and outcomes in patient's ≥65 years old with
HPV+ OPC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients aged 65 and older treated at our
Institution with HPV+ OPC and analyzed patient demographics, disease
characteristics, treatment modalities, toxicities, treatment failures, and
survival. Charlson comorbidity index was calculated for each patient.
RESULTS: 43 patients were identified with a mean age of median age was 70.0
(range 65-86). The mean Charlson comorbidity index score for the cohort was 5.2. 
In total, 72.1% of patients received what was considered standard-of-care based
on stage and pathological features. Nine point three percent of patients required
RT-related treatment breaks with the majority being women (75%). Three-year
actuarial overall survival was 85.5% (95% CI: 71.4%-100%) and 3-year disease-free
survival was 67.3% (95% CI: 49.7-91.0%).
CONCLUSION: This study presented one of the largest series to date evaluating
HPV-related OPC in patients ≥65. Elderly individuals with HPV+ OPC have favorable
overall survival with high treatment tolerability independent of Charlson
co-morbidity score. Elderly patients should be considered for stage-appropriate
care with omission of specific therapies based on absolute contraindications and 
patient preference, but not assumptions regarding tolerability.
