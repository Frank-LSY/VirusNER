OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a healthy man with a previously unreported
combination of generalized varicelliform eruption and herpes zoster oticus.
PATIENT: A 44-year-old immunocompetent man who developed generalized
varicelliform eruption after peripheral facial palsy with herpes zoster oticus
without any underlying immunocompromised state.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The skin lesion was improved during his hospitalization
period. Facial palsy was completely cured after 2 months of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster oticus occurs rarely and accounts for approximately 1% 
of all cases of herpes zoster and generalized varicelliform eruption occurs in 2%
to 10% of unselected patients with herpes zoster. Most of these patients have an 
underlying condition that is associated with an immunocompromised state such as
lymphoproliferative disease. Varicelliform eruptions are extremely rare among
healthy patients without any underlying disease.
