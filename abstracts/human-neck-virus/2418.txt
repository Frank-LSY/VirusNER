BACKGROUND/AIM: Human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) tonsillar and base of tongue
squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC/BOTSCC) have better outcome than corresponding HPV-
cancers. To better individualize treatment, additional predictive markers are
needed. Previously, we have shown that mutated fibroblast growth factor receptor 
3 protein (FGFR3) was correlated to poorer prognosis and here FGFR3 expression
was further analyzed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred-fifteen HPV+TSCC/ BOTSCC biopsies were analyzed
for FGFR3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and 109/115 were analyzed for FGFR3
mutations by Ion Proton sequencing, or by Competitive Allele-Specific Taqman PCR 
(CAST-PCR). Disease-free survival (DFS) was then calculated according to FGFR3
IHC expression.
RESULTS: CAST-PCR was useful for detecting the three most common FGFR3 mutations.
Focusing especially on the 98/115 patients with HPV+TSCC/BOTSCC and wild-type
FGFR3, high FGFR3 expression correlated to significantly better 3-year DFS,
p=0.043.
CONCLUSION: In patients with HPV+TSCC/BOTSCC and wild-type FGFR3, overexpression 
of FGFR3 was correlated with better DFS.
