PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the recent changes in the cause of head and neck cancer
and the association of cystic metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma with human 
papilloma virus (HPV), patients who are diagnosed with a cystic lesion in their
upper neck need thorough investigation before commencing any treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: The differential diagnosis of a cystic mass in the upper neck of
an adult over the age of 40 years is a branchial cleft cyst, cystic metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma or a branchial cleft cyst carcinoma (BCCC). Investigation
must include diagnostic imaging, biopsy or excision biopsy of likely primary
sites, such as oropharyngeal sub-sites, and testing for HPV, Epstein-Barr virus
immunological status.
SUMMARY: The existence of BCCC is an exceptional diagnosis, with less than 40
cases considered proven. Consensus agreement has been proposed on making such a
diagnosis. The diagnosis of a BCCC should be one of exclusion rather than
presumption, after all other possible diagnoses have been considered and
excluded.
