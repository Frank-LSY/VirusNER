PURPOSE: p53 gene plays a crucial role in the response to therapy. Since it is
inactivated in the majority of human cancers, it is strongly believed that the
p53 mutations confer resistance to therapeutics. In this paper we analyzed the
influence of two mechanistically diverse antitumor agents--cisplatin and
methotrexate on the proliferation and cell cycle of two head and neck squamous
cancer cell lines HEp-2 (wild type p53 gene, but HPV 18/E6-inactivated protein)
and CAL 27 (mutated p53 gene), along with the influence of adenovirally mediated 
p53 overexpression in modulation of cisplatin and methoterexate effects, whereby 
subtoxic vector/compound concentrations were employed.
METHODS: p53 gene was introduced into tumor cells using adenoviral vector
(AdCMV-p53). The cell cycle perturbations were measured by two parameter flow
cytometry. The expression of p53, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and cyclin B1 proteins was
examined using immunocytochemistry and western blot methods.
RESULTS: In CAL 27 cells overexpression of p53 completely abrogated high S phase 
content observed in methotrexate-treated cells into a G1 and slight G2 arrest,
while it sustained G2 arrest of the cells treated with cisplatin, along with the 
reduction of DNA synthesis and cyclin B1 expression. On the other hand, in HEp-2 
cell line p53 overexpression slightly slowed down the progression through S phase
in cells treated with methotrexate, decreased the cyclin B1 expression only after
24 h, and failed to sustain the G2 arrest after treatment with cisplatin alone.
Instead, it increased the population of S phase cells that were not actively
synthesizing DNA, sustained cyclin B1 expression and allowed the G2 cells to
progress through mitosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that adenovirally mediated p53
overexpression at sub-cytotoxic levels enhanced the activity of low doses of
cisplatin and methotrexate in HEp-2 and CAL 27 cells through changes in the cell 
cycle. However, the mechanisms of these effects differ depending on the genetic
context and on the chemotherapeutics' modality of action.
