Distinguishing between distantly metastatic and metachronous lung primary
carcinoma is challenging for patients with a history of head and neck cancer.
There are implications for registry data, prognosis and related counseling, and
management options, including eligibility for precision oncology trials. Patients
with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
who were treated under a uniform clinical protocol and achieved a complete
response were identified in a single-institution prospective head and neck cancer
epidemiology database (n = 205). Fifteen patients presented with pulmonary
nodule(s) after completion of therapy. We describe our algorithm for the
evaluation of these patients, including histopathology, p16 immunohistochemistry,
and HPV in situ hybridization.
