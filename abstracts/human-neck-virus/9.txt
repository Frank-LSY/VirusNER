OBJECTIVE: Human papilloma virus (HPV) induced head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a distinct tumor subset. We questioned how
accurately a brushing from the tumor surface detects HPV in patients with HNSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brushings from the tumor surface were compared with HPV
DNA isolation from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies,
which served as the reference standard. In both matrices, HPV DNA was detected
using a commercially available test kit. In addition, p16 was assessed in tumor
biopsies by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The tumors were considered p16 positive
if 70% or more of cancer cells expressed p16.
RESULTS: 93 patients with HNSCC were included. Sensitivity and specificity of the
brush test were 83% (95%CI: 67-92%) and 85% (95%CI: 72-93%). Results of p16 IHC
were concordant with FFPE samples DNA determinations in 73/93 patients. In 53
patients (57%) the tumor was located in the oropharynx and in 40 patients (43%)
the tumor was located in the non-oropharynx region. Sensitivity and specificity
of the brush test in patients with oropharyngeal cancer was higher with 86%
(95%CI: 70-95%) and 89% (95%CI: 65-99%).
CONCLUSION: Superficial brushes from the tumor surface may be used to identify
HPV positive HNSCC.
