OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence and to identify risk factors of hearing
impairment in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children living in Peru.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study.
SETTING: Two public hospitals and 1 nonprofit center in Lima, Peru, between
August 2009 and April 2010.
SUBJECTS: A total of 139 HIV-infected children, ages 4 to 19 years.
METHODS: Hearing impairment and otologic health were assessed with pure tone
audiometry, tympanometry, and otoscopy. The primary outcome was hearing loss,
defined as average threshold >25dB for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, in one or both ears.
Historical and socioeconomic information was obtained through parental survey and
medical chart review. Statistical analysis included univariate analysis and
multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Fifty-four (38.8%) of 139 children had hearing impairment. On
multivariate analysis, risk factors included: tympanic membrane perforation (odds
ratio [OR] 7.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-30.5; P = .01), abnormal
tympanometry (OR 2.71; 95% CI, 1.09-6.75; P = .03), cerebral infection (OR 11.6; 
95% CI, 1.06-126; P = .05), seizures (OR 5.20; 95% CI, 1.21-22.4; P = .03), and
CD4 cell count <500 cells/mm(3) (OR 3.53; 95% CI, 1.18-10.5; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hearing impairment in HIV-infected children in
Lima, Peru was 38.8%. Middle ear disease, prior cerebral infection, and low CD4
cell count were significantly associated with hearing impairment. The high
prevalence of hearing impairment emphasizes the need for periodic hearing
assessment in the routine clinical care of HIV-infected children.
