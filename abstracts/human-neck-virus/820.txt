PURPOSE: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is causally linked to Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) infection. Because all tumor cells carry EBV, the virus itself is a
potential target for therapy. In these tumor cells, EBV hides in a latent state
and expresses only a few non-immunogenic proteins for EBV maintenance and
contributes to tumor growth. We developed a cytolytic virus activation (CLVA)
therapy for NPC treatment, reactivating latent EBV, triggering immune
recognition, and inducing susceptibility to antiviral therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CLVA therapy combines gemcitabine (GCb) and valproic acid
(VPA) for virus activation and tumor clearance with (val)ganciclovir (GCV) as the
antiviral drug to block virus replication and kill proliferating virus-infected
cells. CLVA treatment was optimized and validated in NPC cell lines and
subsequently tested in 3 Dutch patients with NPC that was refractory to
conventional treatment.
RESULTS: In NPC cell lines, both GCb and VPA can induce the lytic cycle of EBV.
Their combination resulted in a strong synergistic effect. The addition of GCV
resulted in higher cytotoxicity compared with chemotherapy alone, which was not
observed in EBV-negative cells. CLVA therapy was analyzed in 3 patients with
end-stage NPC. Patients developed increased levels of viral DNA in the
circulation originating from apoptotic tumor cells, had disease stabilization,
and experienced improved quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results in the initial CLVA-treated patients indicate that the
therapy had a biological effect and was well tolerated with only moderate
transient toxicity. This new virus-specific therapy could open a generic approach
for treatment of multiple EBV-associated malignancies.
