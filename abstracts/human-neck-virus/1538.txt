PURPOSE: We examined overall survival in a large cohort of patients with human
papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative non-oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck (non-OPSCC).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with non-OPSCC and known HPV status were identified
in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Multivariate logistic regression was
applied to examine factors associated with HPV status. Multivariate analysis was 
utilized to determine factors correlated with overall survival. Propensity
score-weighted Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to adjust for confounders in
survival analyses. Multiple imputation method was used for sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 19,993 non-OPSCC patients with 5070 being positive for HPV
in the NCDB. Median follow-up was 23.5 months. HPV-positive patients were more
commonly male, white, with a lower comorbidity index score, presenting with
T-stage <2, and N-stage ≥1. Unadjusted 3-year overall survival was 62% and 80%
for HPV-negative and HPV-positive patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). On
multivariate analysis, mortality was reduced for HPV-positive patients with early
stage (HR = 0.68) and locally advanced disease (HR = 0.46). Adjusted 3-year
overall survival was 65% for HPV-negative and 76% for HPV-positive patients
(p < 0.0001). The survival advantage of HPV was maintained in all subsites and
robust on sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPV-positive non-OPSCC exhibit similar characteristics
as HPV-positive OPSCC. Overall survival was significantly higher for patients
with HPV-positive versus HPV-negative non-OPSCC. These data reveal that
HPV-positive non-OPSCC represent a favorable cohort that warrants recognition in 
the design of future clinical trial investigation.
