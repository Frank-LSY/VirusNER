BACKGROUND: The prevalence of oropharyngeal carcinoma is rising in western Europe
and the United States, where there appears to be a strong association between
human papillomavirus (HPV) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
However, such a correlation has not yet been fully evaluated in Japan.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumour 
HPV status and the demographic and clinicopathological parameters of 71 patients 
with OPSCC at Hokkaido University Hospital, Japan, between 1998 and 2009. The
parameters included age, gender, survival, tumour subsite, tumour-node-metastasis
(TNM) stage, smoking history, second primary tumour status, recurrence/residual
disease at the primary site, and overall survival. HPV status was established by 
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 71 oropharyngeal cancers, 20 were positive for HPV-16, two for
HPV-18, and one for HPV-58. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed improved
overall survival rates in patients with HPV-positive tumours (p = 0.0038)
compared with HPV-negative tumours. Of the 45 patients who received
chemoradiotherapy, HPV-positive patients experienced better overall survival than
HPV-negative patients (p = 0.0032). In a multivariate analysis, the survival
benefit of HPV-positive patients was independent of age and T and N
classification.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV status is a significantly favourable prognostic factor in
oropharyngeal cancer and could be used as a marker to optimize the treatment of
patients with this type of cancer in Japan.
