OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown Snail expression integral to the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition during tumor progression. However, its behavior
in clinical head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) is yet undefined. We 
therefore sought to (1) investigate clinical and histopathologic characteristics 
of Snail-positive HNSCC and (2) understand the link between Snail and other
commonly used HNSCC tumor markers.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study was conducted.
SETTING: This study was conducted in a large-scale academic center.
STUDY SUBJECTS: Of 51 consecutive HNSCC, 42 surgical resections were included.
METHODS: Two separate pathologists performed standard histopathologic reviews
along with immunohistochemistries (Snail, E-cadherin, p16, epidermal growth
factor receptor [EGFR]) and in situ hybridization (human papilloma virus [HPV]). 
Medical review for all cases was performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two (52%) of 42 cases stained 4+ Snail (>75% staining). The
remaining 20 cases were considered negative. Snail was strongly inversely related
to E-cadherin expression (ρ = -0.69, P < .001), but statistically independent
from HPV, p16, or EGFR expression. Snail(+) tumors were equally represented from 
each anatomic subsite. Snail(+) tumors were strongly associated with poor
differentiation (P < .001) and basaloid classification (P = .004). Snail(+)
tumors were also strongly associated with lymphovascular invasion (P = .02), but 
not perineural invasion. Ultimately, 11 (50%) of 22 of Snail(+) tumors
demonstrated positive nodal metastasis and 11 (79%) of 14 node-positive cases
were Snail(+) (P = .02).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides promising evidence of Snail' role as a
molecular prognostic marker for HNSCC. Snail positivity is significantly
predictive of poorly differentiated, lymphovascular invasive, as well as
regionally metastatic tumors. Because Snail positivity appears independent of
HPV, p16, and EGFR expression, Snail may prove to improve upon these markers'
predictive limitations.
