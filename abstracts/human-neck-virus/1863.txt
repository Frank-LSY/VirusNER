PURPOSE: Due to the established role of the human papillomavirus (HPV), the
optimal treatment for oropharyngeal carcinoma is currently under debate. We
evaluated the most important determinants of treatment outcome to develop a
multifactorial predictive model that could provide individualized predictions of 
treatment outcome in oropharyngeal carcinoma patients.
METHODS: We analyzed the association between clinico-pathological factors and
overall and progression-free survival in 168 OPSCC patients treated with curative
radiotherapy or concurrent chemo-radiation. A multivariate model was validated in
an external dataset of 189 patients and compared to the TNM staging system. This 
nomogram will be made publicly available at www.predictcancer.org.
RESULTS: Predictors of unfavorable outcomes were negative HPV-status, moderate to
severe comorbidity, T3-T4 classification, N2b-N3 stage, male gender, lower
hemoglobin levels and smoking history of more than 30 pack years. Prediction of
overall survival using the multi-parameter model yielded a C-index of 0.82 (95%
CI, 0.76-0.88). Validation in an independent dataset yielded a C-index of 0.73
(95% CI, 0.66-0.79. For progression-free survival, the model's C-index was 0.80
(95% CI, 0.76-0.88), with a validation C-index of 0.67, (95% CI, 0.59-0.74).
Stratification of model estimated probabilities showed statistically different
prognosis groups in both datasets (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This nomogram was superior to TNM classification or HPV status alone 
in an independent validation dataset for prediction of overall and
progression-free survival in OPSCC patients, assigning patients to distinct
prognosis groups. These individualized predictions could be used to stratify
patients for treatment de-escalation trials.
