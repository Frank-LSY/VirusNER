BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) accounts for the most common cause of all
virus-associated human cancers. Here, we describe the first graphic user
interface (GUI)-based automated tool 'HPVDetector', for non-computational
biologists, exclusively for detection and annotation of the HPV genome based on
next-generation sequencing data sets.
METHODS: We developed a custom-made reference genome that comprises of human
chromosomes along with annotated genome of 143 HPV types as pseudochromosomes.
The tool runs on a dual mode as defined by the user: a 'quick mode' to identify
presence of HPV types and an 'integration mode' to determine genomic location for
the site of integration. The input data can be a paired-end whole-exome,
whole-genome or whole-transcriptome data set. The HPVDetector is available in
public domain for download:
http://www.actrec.gov.in/pi-webpages/AmitDutt/HPVdetector/HPVDetector.html.
RESULTS: On the basis of our evaluation of 116 whole-exome, 23
whole-transcriptome and 2 whole-genome data, we were able to identify presence of
HPV in 20 exomes and 4 transcriptomes of cervical and head and neck cancer tumour
samples. Using the inbuilt annotation module of HPVDetector, we found predominant
integration of viral gene E7, a known oncogene, at known 17q21, 3q27, 7q35, Xq28 
and novel sites of integration in the human genome. Furthermore, co-infection
with high-risk HPVs such as 16 and 31 were found to be mutually exclusive
compared with low-risk HPV71.
CONCLUSIONS: HPVDetector is a simple yet precise and robust tool for detecting
HPV from tumour samples using variety of next-generation sequencing platforms
including whole genome, whole exome and transcriptome. Two different modes (quick
detection and integration mode) along with a GUI widen the usability of
HPVDetector for biologists and clinicians with minimal computational knowledge.
