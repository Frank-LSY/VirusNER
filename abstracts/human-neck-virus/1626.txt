OBJECTIVES: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is often treated with in-office 
laser procedures using a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser transmitted
through a laser fiber. Although effective, this procedure has notable downsides, 
including the possibility of transmitting human papillomavirus (HPV) in the smoke
plume and the high cost of these single-use fibers. The objective of this study
is to determine if HPV can be detected on a laser fiber after use, with or
without sterilization.
METHODS: Twelve patients with laryngeal papillomas were treated with KTP laser
energy transmitted via a KTP fiber. Ten fibers were sterilized in CIDEX (ASP,
Irvine, California), a glutaraldehyde disinfectant, for 12 minutes, whereas two
fibers were left unsterilized. Human papillomavirus DNA amplification was done on
all 12 fiber samples with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using general
primer mediated 5+ and 6+. Human papillomavirus genotyping detection was done
using type specific probes and/or Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Over 27 strains of HPV were not detected on KTP fibers after use, with
or without sterilization.
CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus was undetectable by PCR on KTP laser fibers that
were sterilized or unsterilized after use. Further studies are needed utilizing a
transmission model to determine if HPV can be incubated from this fiber after
sterilization.
