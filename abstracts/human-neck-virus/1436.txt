IMPORTANCE: The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in unknown primary
squamous cell carcinoma (UPSCC) of the head and neck at initial presentation
focuses the investigation for the primary tumor on the oropharynx. The trends,
frequency, and detection rate of UPSCCs have not been evaluated in the context of
HPV tumor status.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of UPSCC over time and to evaluate the
proportion of HPV-positive UPSCCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-institutional case
series of patients diagnosed with UPSCC and evaluated at the Johns Hopkins
Hospital from January 1, 2005, to June 1, 2014. Human papillomavirus tumor status
was determined by p16 immunohistochemical analysis and/or high-risk HPV DNA by in
situ hybridization as clinically available.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number and clinical characteristics of UPSCC cases
over time.
RESULTS: Eighty-four UPSCC cases were eligible for analysis. The mean age of the 
patients was 57.3 years (range 29-80 years), and 88.1% (n = 74) were male. The
frequency of UPSCC increased significantly over time (P for trend = .01) and was 
significantly higher during later calendar periods (14 cases during 2005-2008 vs 
39 cases during 2012-2014, P = .03). A total of 69 cases (90.7%) with available
HPV tumor status were HPV-positive. The patients with HPV-positive UPSCC were
significantly more likely to be male (91% vs 42.9%, P = .005) and younger (56.1
vs 67.7 years, P = .002) than the HPV-negative patients with UPSCC. The overall
primary tumor site detection rate was 59.3% (n = 48). There was a nonsignificant 
increase in the detection rate from calendar periods 2005-2008 to 2012-2014
(50.0% vs 64.9%, P = .38). Since transoral robotic surgery was adopted in the
diagnostic evaluation of UPSCC in 2011, a nonsignificant increase in the
detection of primary tumors was observed (53.8% vs 64.3%, P = .34).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The frequency of UPSCC has increased significantly in 
recent calendar periods, and most cases are HPV-positive. As expected, patients
with HPV-positive UPSCC tend to be male and younger.
