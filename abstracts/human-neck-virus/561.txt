Papillary squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a rare variant of SCC in the head and
neck region. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in PSCC is still
unclear. We retrospectively reviewed 11 PSCCs in our institute over a 21-year
period and compared the HPV status of PSCCs with 26 squamous cell papillomas
(SCPs). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to detect HPV DNA and in
situ hybridization (ISH) were performed to analyze the relationship between the
papillary lesions and HPV infection. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p16
protein expression was used to analyze the PSCC specimens. Nine of 11 (82 %),
eight of 11 (73 %), and eight of 11 (73 %) PSCC samples were found to be HPV
positive by PCR, ISH, and IHC staining for p16 protein expression, respectively. 
PSCC had a significantly higher rate of HPV infection than SCP by PCR (p = 0.002)
and ISH (p = 0.001) analysis. This study presents different HPV status in two
papillary neoplasms and may help to clarify the unique morphological and
biological characteristics of head and neck PSCC.
