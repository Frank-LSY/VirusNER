Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) as a modality of renal
replacement therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD 5) has
the advantage of being a home-based therapy and is a preferred option in patients
with inadequate access to haemodialysis and transplantation facilities and in
those infected with HIV and other blood-borne viruses. While open surgical CAPD
catheter placement has been the conventional mainstay of access placement,
percutaneous techniques are being increasingly used with similar success rates.
We report our experience over the past two years with blind insertion of the swan
neck percutaneous double-cuffed Tenckhoff CAPD catheter using a trocar. There was
considerable decrease in hospital stay and surgical costs. There was only one
major complication of injury to the jejunal mesenteric artery requiring emergency
laparotomy in one patient. In three patients, drain of peritoneal fluid was
inadequate, presumably due to omental wrapping around the in-dwelling catheter,
and required surgical removal of the omentum.
