BACKGROUND: Individuals with allergies have a heightened Th2 (T helper 2)
immunity, which may provide advantages in controlling tumor growth. Inverse
associations have been reported among individuals with allergies and risk of
brain and pancreatic cancers.
METHODS: We examined the relationship between allergies and risk of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a population-based case-control study with
1,014 cases and 1,193 frequency-matched controls. Logistic regression models were
used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI)
controlling for age, sex, race, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and
education. In addition, in a subset of the population, models were adjusted for
HPV16 status.
RESULTS: Individuals with allergies had a 19 % lower risk of HNSCC (OR = 0.81,
95 % CI = 0.67-0.98). Associations with allergies were stronger for laryngeal
(OR = 0.66, 95 % CI = 0.45-0.97) and oropharyngeal (OR = 0.73, 95 %
CI = 0.57-0.92) cancers, while no association was observed for oral cavity
cancers (OR = 0.98, 95 % CI = 0.76-1.26). History of asthma was not associated
with overall HNSCC, but the association was statistically significant for
oropharyngeal cancer (OR = 0.67, 95 % CI = 0.44-0.99). HPV16 status did not
confound or modify the associations with allergies.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Th2 immunity in individuals with history of allergies and
asthma may reduce the risk of HNSCC. Additional research into related mechanisms 
may provide new insights into how to treat HNSCC.
IMPACT: These findings may provide new insight into biological pathways that
could lead to a better understanding of the etiology of this disease.
