Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious worldwide disease caused
by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). C-C chemokine receptor 
5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) are important coreceptors
mediating HIV-1 cell entry. Many new anti-HIV drugs are currently in preclinical 
and clinical trials; however, drug development has proceeded slowly partly
because of the lack of a high-throughput system to screen these drugs. Here, we
describe the development of a novel dual-luciferase assay using a CCR5/CXCR4
promoter-driven firefly and Renilla luciferase vector (pGL4.10-RLUC-CCR5/CXCR4). 
Drugs were screened for the ability to regulate CCR5 and CXCR4 promoter
activities. The CCR5 and CXCR4 promoters were inserted separately into the
recombinant vector and transfected into the acute T lymphocyte leukemia cell line
H9. Treatment of stable transfected cells with four traditional Chinese medicine 
compounds resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of the CXCR4 and CCR5
promoter activities. The dual-luciferase reporter assay provides a rapid and
direct method to screen anti-AIDS/HIV drugs.
