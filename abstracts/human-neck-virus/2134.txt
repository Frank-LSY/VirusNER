BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is reported as the most influential
factor that triggers hyperreactivity of the airway and causes asthma in infants
and children. However, the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The study
evaluated the changes in the levels of four types of histamine receptor (HR) and 
CC chemokines, such as eotaxin and regulated on activation, normal T cell
expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), in nasal epithelial cells and
fibroblasts after RSV infection.
METHODS: Nasal cavity mucosa attained from 20 patients who had undergone inferior
turbinoplasty were cleaned by normal saline mixed with gentamicin. Each sample
was divided in half. One-half was used for incubation of epithelial cells, and
the other half was used for culturing fibroblasts. The levels of HR 1 (H1R), 2
(H2R), 3 (H3R), 4 (H4R), eotaxin, and RANTES were measured by real-time
polymerase chain reaction 0, 12, and 36 hours after infection with RSV.
RESULTS: H1R was significantly increased at 12 and 36 hours compared with 0 hours
in both cell types. The level of H2R was significantly increased in epithelial
cells from 0 to 36 and 12 to 36 hours and in fibroblasts from 0 to 12 and 0 to 36
hours. There were significant increases of H3R level in fibroblasts from 0 to 12 
and 0 to 36 hours, and of H4R in epithelial cells and fibroblasts from 0 to 12
and 0 to 36 hours. Eotaxin and RANTES were also significantly increased in both
epithelial cells and fibroblasts from 0 to 12 and 0 to 36 hours.
CONCLUSION: RSV infection increases the levels of all four HRs, especially H1R
and H2R, as well as the levels of eotaxin and RANTES in nasal epithelial cells
and fibroblasts. These findings suggest that RSV infection might cause
respiratory tract hyperreactivity by increasing the content of HRs and CC
chemokines.
