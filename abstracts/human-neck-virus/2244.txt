Patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma often
experience relapse, the cause of poor survival statistics. Relapse occurs
following the three main types of treatment, surgery with or without
post-operative (chemo)radiotherapy, or chemoradiation (containing cisplatin).
Cancer relapse can result from (i) outgrowth of residual tumour cells, sometimes 
with a number too small to be detected by routine histopathology or (ii)
development of another carcinoma in a field of pre-neoplastic cells that has
remained after treatment of the primary carcinoma. At this moment, clinical
staging is not enough to identify patients who will develop relapse and who need 
tailored treatment. This review describes the latest knowledge of mechanisms of
cancer relapse, addresses the biomarkers of potential interest detectable in the 
tissue of the tumour or its surgical margins and discusses three biomarkers,
human papillomavirus, TP53 and epidermal growth receptor in more detail. Once a
marker panel has been established, treatment should be focussed on the patients
at risk of relapse by improved tailoring of existing treatment modalities. Also, 
the implementation of more targeting therapies based on the characteristics of
the discovered markers should lead to better survival rates.
