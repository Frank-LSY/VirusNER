BACKGROUND: Neurosyphilis is the tertiary stage of Treponema pallidum infection
that involves the central nervous system, which occurs within days or weeks after
an initial syphilis infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. The
diagnosis of neurosyphilis is quite challenging as it is uncommon and often
presents with obscure symptoms since any organ system may be involved.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 40-year-old African man who is human
immunodeficiency virus positive with early neurosyphilis who presented with a
stiff neck, headache, confusion, restlessness, and a left-sided chest pain; he
did not respond to an empiric treatment of ceftriaxone and fluconazole for
meningitis, and tramadol for headache. Ten days after admission, he developed
generalized tonic-clonic convulsions; on examination he had ipsilateral facial
nerve palsy and an oral ulcer, and responded well to benzathine penicillin
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory diagnosis of neurosyphilis is challenging because to date
there is no single laboratory test which is considered sensitive enough for
diagnosis of the disease, especially in resource-limited settings. Clinical
judgment is still an important part of diagnosis; and neurosyphilis should be
considered a diagnostic differential in patients with Human Immunodeficiency
Virus presenting with central nervous system involvement and in other high-risk
patients.
