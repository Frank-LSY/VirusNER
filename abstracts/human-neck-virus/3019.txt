OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Document survival, prognostic variables, and functional
outcomes of patients with AJCC stage III or IV oropharyngeal cancer, treated with
transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) +/- adjuvant therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively assembled data pertaining to the
above-described patient cohort.
METHODS: Patients treated with TLM for AJCC stage III or IV oropharyngeal cancer 
at Washington University School of Medicine from 1996 to 2006 were followed for a
minimum of 2 years. Recurrence, survival, functional, and human papilloma virus
data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Mean follow-up was 52.6
months. Overall AJCC stages were: III 15% and IV 85%. T stages were T1-2, 74%;
T3-4, 26%. Eighty-three patients underwent neck dissection, 50 received adjuvant 
radiotherapy, and 28 received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Overall survival at 2
and 5 years was 94% and 88%, respectively. Disease-specific survival at 2 and 5
years was 96% and 92%, respectively. Six patients recurred (7%): locally (one),
regionally (four), and distant (five). T stage, positive margins, and p16 status 
significantly impacted survival. The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy in
high-risk patients did not significantly impact survival. Five patients (6%) had 
major surgical complications, but without mortality. Eighty-one percent of
patients had acceptable swallowing function at last follow-up. Immediately
postoperatively, 17% required G-tubes, which dropped to 3.4% of living patients
at 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population, our findings validate TLM +/- adjuvant therapy
as a highly effective strategy for survival, locoregional control, and swallowing
recovery in AJCC stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer. Our finding also show
that p16 positivity improves survival.
