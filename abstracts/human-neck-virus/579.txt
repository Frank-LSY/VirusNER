BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suspected of being a reason for
limited therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Stromal
cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) plays a critical role in the communication
between CSCs and their microenvironment. We investigated the influence of SDF-1α 
on HPV+/HPV- SCC cell lines to find an approach of explanation for the superior
prognosis of HPV+ HNSCCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression of CD44/CXCR4 on HPV+/HPV- SCC
cell lines and monitored the influence of SDF-1α on proliferation, morphology and
migration of HPV+/HPV- SCCs.
RESULTS: HPV- SCCs showed a significant increase of podia formation and an
intensified migration towards SDF-1α. HPV+ SCCs rested nearly unaffected by
SDF-1α.
CONCLUSION: Weakened reaction to SDF-1α in HPV+ SCC could lead to an impaired
communication between CSCs and their niche, that would result in an increased
exposure of CSCs to the harming influence of e.g. chemotherapeutic agents.
