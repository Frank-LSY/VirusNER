BACKGROUND: Infection with Penicillium marneffei is a common opportunistic
infection in Southeast Asia where it is endemic. We report a case of Penicillium 
marneffei infection with fatal outcome in a Togolese woman infected with Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-years-old patient, infected with Human Immunodeficiency
Virus had consulted for ongoing febrile pneumonia since two weeks. Clinical
examination revealed fever of 38.5°C, dyspnea, pulmonary syndrome condensation
and papulo-nodular of "molluscum contagiosum" like lesions located on the face,
arms, neck and trunk. Sputum smear was negative for tuberculosis. The chest
radiograph showed reticulonodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes
and two caves in the right hilar region. The CD4 count was 6 cells/mm3 after a
year of antiretroviral treatment (Zidovudine-Lamivudine-Efavirenz). She was
treated as smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis after a lack of gentamicin and
amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid response. Culture of skin samples and sputum had
revealed the presence of P. marneffei. A treatment with ketoconazole 600 mg per
day was initiated. After two weeks of treatment, there was a decrease in the size
and number of papules and nodules, without any new lesions. We noted
disappearance of cough and fever. The chest X-ray showed a decrease of pulmonary 
lesions. There was no reactivation of P. marneffei infection but the patient died
from AIDS after two years of follow up.
CONCLUSION: We report a case of P. marneffei infection in a HIV-infected patient 
in a non-endemic country. Clinicians should think of P. marneffei infection in
all HIV-infected patients with "molluscum contagiosum" like lesions.
