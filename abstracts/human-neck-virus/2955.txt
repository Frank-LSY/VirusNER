PURPOSE: To report the mature data of a prospective Phase II trial designed to
evaluate the efficacy of an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor cetuximab 
(CTX) added to the concurrent therapy of weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin (PC) and
daily radiation therapy (RT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2005 to 2009, a total of 43 patients were enrolled in
the study. The median follow-up was 31 months (range, 9-59 months). All patients 
had Stage III/IV disease at presentation, and 67% had oropharyngeal primaries.
The weekly IV dose schedules were CTX 250 mg/m(2) (400 mg/m(2) IV loading dose 1 
week before RT), paclitaxel 40 mg/m(2), and carboplatin AUC 2. RT was given at
1.8 Gy per day to 70.2 Gy. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 70% of cases.
RESULTS: All patients completed the planned RT dose, 74% without any treatment
breaks. The planned CTX and PC cycles were completed in 70% (91% with at least
seven of planned nine cycles) and 56% (93% with at least seven of planned eight
cycles) of patients, respectively. Toxicity included Grade 3 mucositis (79%),
rash (9%), leucopenia (19%), neutropenia (19%), and RT dermatitis (16%). The
complete response (CR) rate at the completion of therapy was 84%. The estimated
3-year local regional control rate was 72%. Six patients with an initial CR
subsequently experienced a local recurrence, 10 patients experienced distant
progression. The median overall survival and disease-free survivals have not been
reached. The 3-year actuarial overall survival and disease-free survival were 59%
and 58%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CTX to weekly PC and daily RT was well tolerated and
resulted in encouraging local control and survival rates.
