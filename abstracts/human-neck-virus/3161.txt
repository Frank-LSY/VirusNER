Alcohol affects many organs, including the immune system, with even moderate
amounts of alcohol influencing immune responses. Although alcohol can alter the
actions of all cell populations involved in the innate and adaptive immune
responses, the effect in many cases is a subclinical immunosuppression that
becomes clinically relevant only after a secondary insult (e.g., bacterial or
viral infection or other tissue damage). Alcohol's specific effects on the innate
immune system depend on the pattern of alcohol exposure, with acute alcohol
inhibiting and chronic alcohol accelerating inflammatory responses. The
proinflammatory effects of chronic alcohol play a major role in the pathogenesis 
of alcoholic liver disease and pancreatitis, but also affect numerous other
organs and tissues. In addition to promoting proinflammatory immune responses,
alcohol also impairs anti-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic alcohol exposure also
interferes with the normal functioning of all aspects of the adaptive immune
response, including both cell-mediated and humoral responses. All of these
effects enhance the susceptibility of chronic alcoholics to viral and bacterial
infections and to sterile inflammation.
