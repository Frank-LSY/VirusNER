The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) mediate membrane 
fission from the cytoplasmic face of the bud neck. ESCRTs were originally
identified as factors involved in multivesicular body vesicle biogenesis in yeast
but have since been shown to function in other membrane fission events in
mammalian cells, including enveloped virus budding and the abscission step of
cytokinesis. Several recent studies have revealed that not all ESCRT factors are 
required for each of these biological processes, and this review summarizes our
current understanding of the different requirements for ESCRT factors in these
three different ESCRT-mediated mammalian membrane fission processes.
