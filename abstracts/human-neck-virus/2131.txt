CONCLUSION: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was significantly
related to lymph node size in patients with single node metastasis of oral and
oropharyngeal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between
high-risk HPV infection and lymph node size in patients with single node
metastasis of oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: This study included 48 patients with oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma.
Pathologic lymph node stages comprised 36 N1 and 12 N2a.
RESULTS: High-risk HPV in situ hybridization was positive in 29% of patients
(14/48). Of those patients with high-risk HPV, there was a significant difference
(p = 0.008) between oral (9.5%) and oropharyngeal (44.4%) cancers. Average lymph 
node diameter was 20.7 ± 12.6 mm (range 5-54 mm). We found a positive correlation
between high-risk HPV status and lymph node size (p = 0.018). Mean lymph node
diameter in high-risk HPV-positive cases was 27.3 ± 13.1 mm and 18.0 ± 11.5 mm in
high-risk HPV-negative cases. Extracapsular spread (p = 0.030) and cystic nodal
metastases (p = 0.019) were also significantly related to lymph node size.
High-risk HPV negative status (p = 0.043), advanced tumor stage (p = 0.009), and 
extracapsular spread (p = 0.038) all had significant adverse effects on 5-year
disease-specific survival.
