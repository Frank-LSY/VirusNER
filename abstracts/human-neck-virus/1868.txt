BACKGROUND: There is little information in the literature describing the
relationship between posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)
incidence and presentation with both recipient Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
serostatus and EBV status of PTLD histology, particularly in the late
posttransplantation period.
METHODS: This study reports the largest UK single-center, single-organ analysis
of PTLD to date in a retrospective cohort study of 80 cases occurring in 4189
adult renal transplant recipients.
RESULTS: The incidence rate was 2.6 cases per 1000 patient-years (95% confidence 
interval [95% CI], 2.1-3.2) for PTLD, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4) for non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, and 0.2 (95% CI, 0.07-4.2) for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma occurred at a rate 7.6 times that of the adult general population in
England, whereas the rate for Hodgkin's lymphoma was 5.9 times. The incidence of 
PTLD was highest during the 10th to 14th posttransplantation years. Early-onset
disease was associated with EBV-seronegative recipient status, EBV-positive
histology, and the involvement of extranodal sites. PTLD occurring in
EBV-seronegative recipients was associated with EBV nuclear antigen antibody
deficiency, polymorphic disease, and the involvement of extranodal sites.
EBV-negative histology occurred in 32% of cases at a median time to presentation 
of 109 months. PTLD involving the allograft, central nervous system, and skin was
uncommon and occurred late.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of PTLD is highest in the late posttransplantation
period. Close clinical surveillance and education for transplant recipients is
required for the duration of time while immunosuppressed. Failure to detect EBV
DNA in blood should not reassure, particularly in patients with symptoms such as 
abdominal pain, oropharyngeal complaints, neck lumps, and B-symptoms.
