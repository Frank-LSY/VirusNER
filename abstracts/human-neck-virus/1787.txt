We assessed a population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma in Southeast Scotland over 13â€…months. p16 and human
papilloma virus (HPV) expression were determined, and correlated with stage,
treatment, smoking and alcohol history, and disease outcomes. Retrospective
analysis was performed on 60 patients. p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV
genotyping were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. HPV
infection (as defined by p16 positivity and/or HPV PCR positivity) was identified
in 57% of samples, while dual positives were detected in 45% of cases. HPV16 was 
most prevalent of the HPV types and was associated with 90% of positive samples. 
Cause-specific 1-year and 2-year survivals were 82.5% and 78.2%, respectively.
The p16-positive and HPV-positive groups demonstrated significantly increased
cause-specific survival in comparison with their negative counterparts.
