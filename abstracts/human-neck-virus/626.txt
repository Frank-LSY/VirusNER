ATC cell lines were differentially susceptible to each virus. Vaccinia virus was superior to myxoma and tanapox viruses for the control of anaplastic thyroid cancer in vitro. Although subsequent investigation using an expanded panel of cell lines revealed differential susceptibility to vaccinia virus, effective control of cell proliferation was still achieved using higher titers.
