Cases of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck cancers are rapidly 
increasing in the United States. Little is known about the economic burden of
these cancers. A literature review identified 7 studies that characterized
aspects of the overall economic burden of HPV-associated head and neck cancers in
the United States. Other cost studies are detailed to highlight the clinical
reality in treating these patients. As the clinical awareness of the role of HPV 
in head and neck cancers continues, the economic impact of cancers caused by this
virus will have implications for the role of various preventive measures.
