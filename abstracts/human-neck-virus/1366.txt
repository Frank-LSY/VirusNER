BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the pattern of lymph node
regression and morphology following definitive radiation therapy (RT) for human
papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma in patients with disease
control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographically positive cervical lymph nodes from
patients treated with definitive RT for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma
were segmented on initial pre- and subsequent post-RT contrast enhanced CT
images. Pre-specified quantitative nodal parameters were calculated. Initial
nodal parameter correlates of final nodal size, final nodal volume, and time to
<1 cm short-axis diameter were determined.
RESULTS: Sixty-six radiographically positive lymph node were analyzed in 36
patients. Lymph nodes exhibited initial volume decreases with size stabilization 
at ∼4 months. Fifteen nodes (23%) underwent complete radiographic response
(median 6.4 months following RT; range 2.9-25.6 months). On multivariate
time-to-event analysis, initial hypodense/fat component, nodal volume, and
short-axis diameter exhibited inverse association, while higher HU standard
deviation exhibited a positive association, with reaching <1 cm short-axis
diameter (all p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a substantial decrease in nodal volume within the
first 1-2 months following RT. These findings support our current nodal imaging
paradigm, propose a quantitative methodology, and describe a reference dataset
for further validation and comparison studies.
