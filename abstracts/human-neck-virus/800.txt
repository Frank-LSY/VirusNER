Polymerization of Gag on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane drives the
assembly of Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1). Gag recruits components of
the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) to facilitate
membrane fission and virion release. ESCRT assembly is initiated by recruitment
of ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I, which bind directly to the viral Gag protein and then
recruit the downstream ESCRT-III and VPS4 factors to complete the budding
process. In contrast to previous models, we show that ALIX is recruited
transiently at the end of Gag assembly, and that most ALIX molecules are recycled
into the cytosol as the virus buds, although a subset remains within the virion. 
Our experiments imply that ALIX is recruited to the neck of the assembling virion
and is mostly recycled after virion release.
