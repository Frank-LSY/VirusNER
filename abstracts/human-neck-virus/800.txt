First we analyzed outcomes from 748 head and neck cancer patients with locoregionally advanced stage tumors treated with curative-intent chemoradiation by anatomic site. Second, we analyzed seven oral tongue (OT) tumors from young, non-smokers/non-drinkers for the presence of viral mRNA using short-read massively-parallel sequencing (RNA-Seq) in combination with a newly-developed digital subtraction method followed by viral screening and discovery algorithms. For positive controls we used an HPV16-positive HNC cell line, a cervical cancer, and an EBV-LMP2A transgene lymphoma.
