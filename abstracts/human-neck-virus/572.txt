INTRODUCTION: The burden of HPV-related Head and Neck Cancers (HNC) has been
rising in the U.S. and other developed countries but this trend has not been
reported in Africa. Objective of study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV
infection in HNC cancer cases seen between 1990 and 2011 at the tertiary health
care institutions in Nigeria.
METHODS: We retrieved 149 head and neck cancer formalin fixed, paraffin embedded 
tumor specimens diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 from four teaching hospitals in
Nigeria. One hundred and twenty-three blocks (83%) contained appropriate HNC for 
analysis while DNA extraction was successful in 60% (90/149). PCR amplification
was successful in 33% (49/149) and Linear Array genotyping for HPV was successful
in 11% (17/149) of these cases. These were in tumors from the larynx (6),
cervical lymph nodes (3), nasal cavity (2), parotid (1), palate (1), maxillary
sinus (1) and mandible (1). Two cases were non-specific and none were from the
oropharynx. Histologically, 41% (7/17) of the successfully genotyped blocks were 
squamous cell carcinomas (larynx 6, maxillary sinus 1).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We were unable to detect HPV in any of the HNC samples in
our study. Our result may suggest that there is a low prevalence of HPV-related
HNC among the adult population in Nigeria. Our results provide a benchmark to
compare future incidence of HPV -related HNC in this community in future. We had 
significant analytical challenges from possible poor tissue processing and urge
that future studies should prospectively collect samples and ensure high quality 
sample processing.
