Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have been shown to have a significantly better prognosis and response to current treatment modalities. Current guidelines recommend systematic HPV-DNA and/or p16 testing on HNSCCs, although treatment approach should not be directed by test results. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess whether HPV-DNA and/or p16 status are systematically evaluated across North American otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons and (2) whether the status is used to direct treatment approach.
