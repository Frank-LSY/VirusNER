OBJECTIVE: Randomized data comparing surgery to radiation for locally advanced
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) are lacking. This study evaluated practice patterns
and overall survival outcomes from the National Cancer Database.
METHODS: A total of 22,676 patients with stage III to IV, locally advanced OPC
were treated between 2004 to 2013 with primary chemoradiation (CRT) or surgery
with adjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (aRT ± CT). Survival
rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Crude and adjusted hazard
ratios (HR) were computed using Cox regression modeling.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 40.7 months; 8,555 and 14,121 patients received
surgery with aRT ± CT and CRT, respectively. Corresponding 3-year survival was
85.4% and 72.6% (P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for age,
gender, race insurance status, median income, percentage with no high-school
degree, Charlson-Deyo score, clinical tumor and node stage, tumor grade, facility
type, treatment at > 1 facility, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status, surgery
with aRT ± CT had a reduced hazard of death, HR, 0.79 (95% confidence interval
0.69-0.91), P = 0.001.
CONCLUSION: Primary surgery with aRT ± CT for locally advanced OPC has an
improved survival compared to primary radiation-based treatment even when
stratified by HPV status.
