Strong and diffuse p16 immunoreactivity was found in 7 of the 40 cases (17.5%). In situ hybridization showed a diffuse episomal signal in those samples. However, PCR could not reliably detect the presence of HPV genes. Furthermore, p16-expressing epithelial cells were mostly negative for the proliferation marker Ki-67.
