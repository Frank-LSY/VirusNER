The oropharynx has a crucial role in swallowing because of the surrounding
constrictor musculature, need for mobility and pliability, and proximity of the
base of tongue to the larynx. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection as a cause of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has increased dramatically in proportion
and overall numbers of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases. Better
clinical response to therapy and younger age of the HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma patients have caused functional and quality-of-life considerations
to become more important endpoints in evaluating efficacy of therapeutic options;
"deintensification" to ameliorate toxicity is under investigation for this
population.
