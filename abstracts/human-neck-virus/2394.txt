BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate mRNA
translation/decay, and may serve as biomarkers. We characterised the expression
of miRNAs in clinically sampled oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC
and PSCC) and described the influence of human papilloma virus (HPV).
METHODS: Biopsies obtained from 51 patients with OSCC/PSCC and 40 control
patients were used for microarray analysis. The results were correlated to
clinical data and HPV status. Supervised learning by support vector machines was 
employed to generate a diagnostic miRNA signature.
RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between
OSCC and normal oral epithelium, with the downregulation of miR-375 and
upregulation of miR-31 as the most significant aberrations. Pharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma exhibited 38 differentially expressed miRNAs compared with normal 
pharyngeal epithelium. Differences in the miRNA expression pattern of both normal
epithelium and SCC were observed between the oral cavity compared with the
pharynx. Human papilloma virus infection revealed perturbations of 21 miRNAs,
most significantly in miR-127-3p and miR363. A molecular classifier including 61 
miRNAs was generated for OSCC with an accuracy of 93%.
CONCLUSION: MicroRNAs may serve as useful biomarkers in OSCC and PSCC. The
influence of HPV on miRNA may provide a mechanism for the distinct clinical
behaviour of HPV-infected tumours.
