BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cancer cells require increased nutrient uptake to support a high
rate of proliferation, and the overexpression of glucose transporters, in
particular GLUT1, is a common characteristic of human malignancies. Here, we
investigated the relationship between the expression of GLUT1 and cell viability,
colony forming ability and apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model in vivo.
METHODS: Lentiviral mediated overexpression and knock-down of GLUT1 was performed
in two oral cancer cell lines (CAL27 and SCC25). QRT-PCR and Western blot
analysis were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 and nuclear
factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 subunit. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by 
MTT and flow cytometry analyses, respectively. Colony formation assays were
performed by staining with 0.5% crystal violet. The role of GLUT1 in HNSCC was
examined in vivo through the generation of a CAL27 (or CAL27 with different
transfections) nude mice xenograft model of HNSCC.
RESULTS: GLUT1 overexpression promoted cell viability and colony formation
whereas GLUT1 silencing had the opposite effect. GLUT1 knock-down significantly
increased the number of Annexin V positive cells in both cell lines and GLUT1
overexpression had the opposite effect, indicating that GLUT1 modulates
apoptosis. Xenograft mouse models of GLUT1 knockdown and overexpression showed
that GLUT1 expression was associated with poor survival and increased tumor
growth. GLUT1 overexpression significantly upregulated the expression of
NFκB-p65, and this effect was reversed by inhibition of GLUT1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: GLUT1 expression plays an important role in the survival of HNSCC,
and its effects may be associated with the activation of the NFκB pathway.
