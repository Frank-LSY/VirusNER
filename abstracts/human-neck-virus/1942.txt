OBJECTIVE: To assess the public's awareness of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a
causative factor for oropharyngeal cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-three-item survey.
SETTING: Local shopping malls and Maxwell Air Force Base in 2012.
METHODS: Respondents were randomly chosen to participate in 23-item survey at
various local shopping malls and at Maxwell Air Force Base in 2012. The χ(2) test
was used in statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The majority of respondents (n = 319) were civilians; 158 were military 
officer trainees (MOTs). All MOTs had a bachelor's degree or higher, while 37% of
civilian respondents had a bachelor's degree or higher. Most MOTs (82%) were
aware of oropharyngeal cancer, and 53% of civilians had not heard of
oropharyngeal cancer (P < .0001). Most respondents (73% civilian and 91%
military) were aware of the association between HPV and cervical cancer.
Conversely, 75% of civilian population and 49% of MOTs were not aware of the
association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancer (P < .0001). The majority of
respondents (61% military and 81% civilian) did not know that both sexes were
eligible for HPV vaccine (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents were aware that HPV is a causative agent of
cervical cancer. However, the majority were not aware of the association between 
oropharyngeal cancer and HPV. Furthermore, many respondents were not aware that
HPV equally affects males and females and that the vaccine is available for both 
sexes. This underscores the need to educate the public on the availability of HPV
vaccine and the association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancer.
