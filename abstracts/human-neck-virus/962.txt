The link between head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), especially
oropharyngeal cancer, and HPV has become established. HPV16 is the most common
genotype in these tumours but HPV6 and HPV11 can also be found in a minority of
these cancers, implying that these low-risk HPV types are not entirely benign in 
the head and neck region. HPV status is also associated with p16 expression and
HPV+ tumours are less likely to harbour p53 mutations. HPV DNA is closely
associated with poorly differentiated cancers, positive lymph nodes and
late-stage disease, which all indicate poor prognosis. Contradictory to this,
patients with HPV+ HNSCC seem to have significantly improved response to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy as compared with HPV-negative tumours.
Interestingly, the risk factors of HNSCC are the same as for HPV, including the
number of sexual partners, younger age at first sexual intercourse, practice of
oral sex, history of genital warts and younger age.
