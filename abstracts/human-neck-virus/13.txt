Brushings from the tumor surface were compared with HPV DNA isolation from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies, which served as the reference standard. In both matrices, HPV DNA was detected using a commercially available test kit. In addition, p16 was assessed in tumor biopsies by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The tumors were considered p16 positive if 70% or more of cancer cells expressed p16.
