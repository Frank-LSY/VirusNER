driven by human papillomavirus.

OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causal and prognostic factor for
oropharyngeal cancer, but its role in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity 
(SCCOC) is unclear. We sought to clarify HPV's role in SCCOC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed SCCOC (N=460) were
prospectively recruited, treated, and followed at one institution. p16/HPV status
was determined by p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (N=210), PCR-based HPV 16/18
E6/7 DNA testing (N=403), and/or HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) (N=178).
Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare survival by p16/HPV
status.
RESULTS: p16 expression was detected in 30% of tumors (62/210) and HPV 16/18 E6/7
DNA in 28% (114/403), although correlation between these two assays was poor
(r=-0.01). Patients with p16-positive tumors were more likely to be younger and
have primary tumors of the oral tongue. Only 4% of tumors (7/171) were positive
for HPV by ISH. Comparisons of patients with p16-positive and p16-negative
tumors, patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors by PCR, and patients
with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors by ISH showed no significant
differences in disease-specific or disease-free survival by p16/HPV status. When 
we applied a more stringent definition of HPV positivity based on a combination
of assay results, only 10 of 166 tumors were HPV positive, and there were no
significant differences in demographic, exposure, clinical, or survival
characteristics between these patients and the 156 HPV-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Very few patients with SCCOC have HPV-driven tumors. SCCOC that
overexpresses p16 may be a unique subset deserving of further study.
