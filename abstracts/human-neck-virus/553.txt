BACKGROUND: We assessed the development in the number of new base of tongue
squamous-cell carcinoma (BSCC) cases per year in eastern Denmark from 2000 to
2010 and whether HPV may explain any observable increased incidence.
METHODS: We performed HPV DNA PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry analysis for all
(n=210) BSCCs registered in the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) and
the Danish Pathology Data Bank, and genotyped all HPV-positive specimens with
amplicon-based next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: The overall crude incidence of BSCCs increased significantly (5.4% per
year) during the study period. This was explained by a significant increase in
the number of HPV-positive BSCCs (8.1% per year), whereas the number of
HPV-negative BSCCs did not increase significantly. The overall HPV prevalence was
51%, with HPV16 as the predominant HPV type.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of HPV-positive BSCCs may explain the
increasing incidence of BSCCs in eastern Denmark, 2000-2010.
