We describe 3 patients with an 8- to 15-year history of HIV disease and HAART who presented a unique feature of HIV lipodystrophy, the "bullfrog neck." In addition to their features of facial lipoatrophy and "buffalo hump," patients had the unique feature of circumferential enlargement of the neck. All patients were undergoing treatment with the same non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) medication, efavirenz.
