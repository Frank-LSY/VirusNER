OBJECTIVES: Extracapsular extension (ECE) in cervical metastatic lymph nodes
remains an indication for adding chemotherapy for patients with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). The aim of this study is to identify specific
imaging characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scan that are predictive of
ECE in order to better risk stratify patients preoperatively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single cohort study was performed using a prospectively 
collected database of patients with HPV-related OPSCC who underwent transoral
robotic surgery with cervical lymphadenectomy. CT scans were assessed for the
presence of multiple imaging characteristics, including lymph node size, number
of nodes positive, cystic appearance, and border irregularity. Univariable and
multivariable analyses were performed to analyze each variable's predictability
of pathologic ECE.
RESULTS: 100 patients underwent TORS with cervical lymphadenectomy for OPSCC from
2010 to 2015. Ninety-one percent (21/23) of patients with 3 or more
radiologically suspicious nodes were found to have pathologic ECE, which was a
significantly greater proportion than patients with fewer suspicious nodes
(p<0.001). CT scans with 3 or more radiologically suspicious nodes displayed a
sensitivity and specificity of 55% and 94%, respectively with a positive
predictive value (PPV) of 91% for ECE. Irregular borders and age were also
correlated with ECE on multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The presence of 3 or more radiologically suspicious
lymph nodes on CT scan has a 91% PPV for any histologic evidence of ECE. The
absolute number of radiographically suspicious lymph node metastases may be a
useful method for risk-stratifying patients for the presence of ECE.
