The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) continues to rise 
worldwide at a dramatic pace, buoyed by the predominance of human papilloma virus
(HPV) driven disease (Panwar et al. 2014). While the outcomes of patients with
HPV-positive OPSCC are dramatically improved compared to HPV-negative OPSCC,
treatment failures do occur. The result is an inevitable rise in the incidence of
recurrent OPSCC. Since the majority of incident OPSCC cases are treated with some
form of radiation therapy (primary or adjuvant), surgery remains the backbone of 
treatment for recurrent OPSCC. This section will focus on options for surgical
management of recurrent OPSCC.
