In males, 50% of HNSCC were HPV DNA positive and 25% of these were multiple HPV-types infections and in women, 72% and 31%, respectively. Low-risk (LR) HPV-types were found in 20.5% and co-infection with HSV-1 in 6.6%. Patients with HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC had similar survival. Patients not treated with chemoradiotherapy and co-infected with HSV-1 and HPV had a worse outcome. Similarly patients with LR-HPVs treated with radiotherapy had a poor prognosis.
