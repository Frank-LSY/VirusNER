BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study of human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), p21, and p53 in sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) was to help
elucidate its pathogenesis.
METHODS: Seventy-three IPs, 48 nasal polyps, and 85 hypertrophied turbinates were
subjected to HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study. Seventy-three IPs, 30
nasal polyps, and 32 hypertrophied turbinates were subjected to EBV in situ
hybridization (ISH), p21, and p53 immunohistochemical (IHC) studies.
RESULTS: HPV was positive in 3 of 73 IPs (4.1%). All specimens were EBV negative.
In all, 99% of IPs showed strong and diffuse p21 nuclear reactivity. Most nasal
polyps and hypertrophied turbinates showed weak to moderate immunoreactivity of
the basal and parabasal cells. Only focal p53 immunoreactivity of the basal and
parabasal cells was found in 19% of IPs and 40% of nasal polyps.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV prevalence of our IP is low. EBV is not present in IP. High p21 
and low p53 expression in IP suggests a non-p53-dependent regulation pathway.
