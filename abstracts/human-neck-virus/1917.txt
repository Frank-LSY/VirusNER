PURPOSE: How tumors evade or suppress immune surveillance is a key question in
cancer research, and overcoming immune escape is a major goal for lengthening
remission after cancer treatment. Here, we used the papillomavirus-associated
rabbit auricular VX2 carcinoma, a model for studying human head and neck cancer, 
to reveal the mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effects of
intraperitoneal oxidative stress following O3/O2-pneumoperitoneum (O3/O2-PP)
treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Solid auricular VX2 tumors were induced in immune-competent 
adult New Zealand White Rabbits. Animals were O3/O2-PP- or sham-treated, after
which they underwent tumor ablation upon reaching no-go criteria. CD3(+)
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and 
expression levels of 84 immune response genes were measured by quantitative
real-time PCR. Adoptive transfer of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL)-derived
from animals with tumor regression-into control animals with progressing tumors
was implemented to assess acquired tumor resistance functionally.
RESULTS: Auricular VX2 tumors regressing after O3/O2-PP treatment exhibited
increased levels of CD3(+) TILs; they also exhibited enhanced expression of genes
that encode receptors involved in pattern recognition, molecules that are
required for antigen presentation and T cell activation, and inflammatory
mediators. Adoptive cell transfer of PBLs from donor rabbits with regressing
tumors to recipient rabbits with newly implanted VX2 carcinoma resulted in
acquired tumor resistance of the host and tumor regression.
CONCLUSION: Intraperitoneal oxidative stress effectively converts the immune
response against the papillomavirus-associated rabbit VX2 carcinoma from tumor
permissive to tumoricidal and leads to a sustainable, adoptively transferable
oncolytic immune response.
