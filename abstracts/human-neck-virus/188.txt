PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In head and neck cancer management, immunoexpression of
protein p16 is widely used as a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus (HPV)
positivity due to challenges of direct HPV testing. Previously p16 has been
reported to have good sensitivity but only moderate specificity in HPV-status
determination. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing information on 
sensitivity and specificity of p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HPV-status
determination among the recent studies.
RECENT FINDINGS: We searched the time period from October 2014 to April 2016 and 
included 28 studies (a total of 31 analyses), which reported both p16 and HPV
status in their series. The sensitivity of p16 in HPV determination ranged
between 28.2 and 100.0%. The mean and median sensitivities were 90.5 and 95.4%,
respectively. The specificity ranged between 31.1 and 100.0%. The mean and median
specificities were 83.3 and 87.3%, respectively.
SUMMARY: Our review presents current information on the feasibility of p16 IHC in
HPV status determination, which is in line with previous studies. Patients with
HPV-positive tumors can be identified with p16 IHC, but a risk for
misclassification of HPV-negative tumors as HPV positive exists. This fact has to
be taken into consideration if HPV status will influence treatment planning.
