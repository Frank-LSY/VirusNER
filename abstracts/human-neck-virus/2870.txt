BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral
therapy (ART) are associated with bone loss leading to increased fracture rate
among HIV-infected individuals. ART-induced bone loss is most intense within the 
first 48 weeks of therapy, providing a window for prophylaxis with long-acting
antiresorptives.
METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized 63
nonosteoporotic, ART-naive adults with HIV initiating ART with
atazanavir/ritonavir + tenofovir/emtricitabine to a single zoledronic acid (ZOL) 
infusion (5 mg) vs placebo to determine the efficacy of ZOL in mitigating
ART-induced bone loss. Plasma bone turnover markers and bone mineral density
(BMD) were performed at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. Primary outcome was change
in C-terminal telopeptide of collagen at 24 weeks. Repeated-measures analyses
using mixed linear models were used to estimate and compare study endpoints.
RESULTS: The ZOL arm had a 65% reduction in bone resorption relative to the
placebo arm at 24 weeks (0.117 ng/mL vs 0.338 ng/mL; P < .001). This effect of
ZOL occurred as early as 12 weeks (73% reduction; P < .001) and persisted through
week 48 (57% reduction; P < .001). The ZOL arm had an 8% higher lumbar spine BMD 
at 12 weeks relative to the placebo arm (P = .003), and remained 11% higher at 24
and 48 weeks. Similar trends were observed in the hip and femoral neck.
CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of ZOL administered at ART initiation prevented
ART-induced bone loss through the first 48 weeks of ART, the period when
ART-induced bone loss is most pronounced. Validation of these results in larger
multicenter randomized clinical trials is warranted.
