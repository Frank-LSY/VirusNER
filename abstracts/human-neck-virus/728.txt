BACKGROUND: Adenoviral mediated suicide gene therapy has been shown to have a
tumoricidal effect against a variety of tumor models. Although the efficacy of
this treatment regimen has been verified, the molecular mechanism of Herpes
simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSVtk)- and ganciclovir (GCV)-induced cell
death is still not well established.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mode of cell death by adenoviral (Adv)-HSVtk/GCV was
examined in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line, NT8e.
RESULTS: The cell death was independent of apoptotic gene expression. Moreover
apoptosis was not evident from cell cycle kinetic analysis. Adv-HSVtk/GCV treated
cells showed time dependent accumulation of cells in the S-phase of the cell
cycle although there was no increase in the "apoptotic peak" or sub-G1
population. Swelling of the cytoplasm without apparent nuclear condensation
suggested a possible involvement of necrosis.
CONCLUSION: The apoptotic mechanism may not play a central role in the
Adv-HSVtk/GCV induced NT8e cell death and other mechanisms should be considered.
