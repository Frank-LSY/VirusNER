Humans and other mammals are colonized by microbial agents across the kingdom
which can represent a unique microbiome pattern. Dysbiosis of the microbiome has 
been associated with pathology including cancer. We have identified a microbiome 
signature unique to ovarian cancers, one of the most lethal malignancies of the
female reproductive system, primarily because of its asymptomatic nature during
the early stages in development. We screened ovarian cancer samples along with
matched, and non-matched control samples using our pan-pathogen array
(PathoChip), combined with capture-next generation sequencing. The results show a
distinct group of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic signatures of high
significance in ovarian cases. Further analysis shows specific viral integration 
sites within the host genome of tumor samples, which may contribute to the
carcinogenic process. The ovarian cancer microbiome signature provides insights
for the development of targeted therapeutics against ovarian cancers.
