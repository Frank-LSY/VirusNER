PURPOSE: Oral leukoplakia is a well-recognized precancerous lesion of squamous
cell carcinoma. When accompanied with abnormal p53 expression, it suffered a
higher risk of canceration. The present study was carried out to test whether the
recombinant human adenovirus-p53 could introduce wild-type p53 gene to oral
leukoplakia cells and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We select p53(-) oral dysplastic keratinocyte POE-9n, to
observe the growth inhibition, cell cycle change, apoptosis-induced effects, and 
elaborate the corresponding molecular mechanism of recombinant adenovirus-p53 on 
POE-9n cells. Meanwhile, we evaluate the feasibility, safety, and biological
activity of multipoints intraepithelial injections of recombinant adenovirus-p53 
in 22 patients with dysplastic oral leukoplakia.
RESULTS: Exogenous p53 could be successfully transduced into POE-9n cells by
recombinant adenovirus-p53. The optimal infecting titer in this study was
multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 100. Recombinant adenovirus-p53 could strongly 
inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and arrest cell cycle in stage G(1)
in POE-9n cells by inducing p21(CIP/WAF) and downregulating bcl-2 expression. In 
the posttreatment patients, p53 protein and p21(CIP/WAF) protein expression were 
significantly enhanced, yet bcl-2 protein presented low expression. Sixteen
patients showed clinical response to the treatment, and 14 patients showed
obvious histopathologic improvement.
CONCLUSION: Intraepithelial injections of recombinant human adenovirus-p53 were
safe, feasible, and biologically active for patients with dysplastic oral
leukoplakia.
