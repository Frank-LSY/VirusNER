The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a major determinant in prognostic risk modeling. However, most risk models are based on clinical trials which only include a selected patient population. The clinical significance of HPV and other prognostic factors in patients with OPSCC remains to be evaluated in a large, unselected cohort, which also includes patients with stage I/II disease and patients with severe comorbidity.
