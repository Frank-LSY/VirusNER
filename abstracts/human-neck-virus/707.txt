BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell
cancer (SCC) has now been well established. Clinicians' experiences and
challenges of talking to patients about HPV have yet to be explored.
METHODS: Fifteen health professionals caring for patients with oropharyngeal SCC 
were interviewed. Interviews were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Participants expressed mixed views about explaining the causal role of
HPV to their patients. Normalizing HPV and emphasizing the positive prognosis
associated with it were regarded as key messages to be communicated. Challenging 
experiences included managing couples in a consultation and patients' concerns
about transmitting HPV to their partners. Some participants described limitations
to their HPV knowledge and identified the need for further information and
training.
CONCLUSION: This study identified challenges experienced by health professionals 
working with patients with oropharyngeal SCC and highlights some key messages to 
convey to patients. Clinical guidance for health professionals and further
information for patients about HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC are needed.
