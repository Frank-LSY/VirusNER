Human papilloma virus infection is thought to play a role in laryngeal
carcinogenesis; the variable association reported in literature may be due to
wide range of HPV genotypes. We report the case of a 51-year-old man affected by 
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; analysis of DNA extracted by cancer cells by
an innovative molecular virology assay (INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra) showed
the presence of two high-risk HPV genotypes, HPV-73 and -82. Immunohistochemical 
examination confirmed positivity for both capsid protein and viral oncogenic
protein E7. Such association has never been reported in literature so far, and a 
brief discussion on the importance of assessing HPV status in laryngeal cancer is
provided.
