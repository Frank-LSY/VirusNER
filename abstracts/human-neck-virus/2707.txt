INTRODUCTION: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) incidence has
increased over the past two decades largely because of an increase in human
papilloma virus (HPV)-related OPSCC. We report here outcomes of definitive
radiation therapy for OPSCC with simultaneous integrated boost
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in a regional Australian cancer centre.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records (EMR) of all
patients treated with IMRT for head and neck cancer. We included patients who
received a curative intent IMRT for OPSCC (2010-2014).
RESULTS: Of 61 patients, 80% were men, and the median age was 57 years. Ninety
percent of our patients received concurrent systemic therapy, and 68% were p16
positive. The median radiotherapy dose received was 70 Gy in 35 fractions. The
median follow up for surviving patients was 22 months. Twenty-four month
actuarial data show that the loco-regional recurrence free, metastasis-free MFS, 
cancer-specific (CaSS) and overall survival percentages were 98.3%, 92.6%, 91%
and 90.3%, respectively. We did not observe grades 4 or 5 acute or late
toxicities, and 10 patients (16.2%) exhibited persistent grade 3 toxicity 6
months after completing the treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results from curative IMRTs for OPSCC delivered in a regional
cancer centre are comparable with results published by tertiary referral centres.
A long-term follow up of this patient cohort will continue for further analyses
and comparisons with tertiary centres.
