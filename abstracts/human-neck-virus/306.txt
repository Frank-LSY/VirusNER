BACKGROUND: As the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in carcinogenesis continues
to rise, the role of genetic factors that modify this risk have become
increasingly important. In this study, we reviewed the literature for
associations between polymorphisms and HPV in carcinogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To identify any associations of genetic polymorphisms with oncogenic
HPV in carcinogenesis and to evaluate the methodology used.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review of HPV, genetic polymorphisms, and
cancer risk. Odds ratios (OR), interaction terms, and p-values were tabulated.
Meta-analyses and measures of heterogeneity were estimated using RevMan 5.1.
RESULTS: The cervix was the most frequently studied cancer site followed by the
head and neck. Overall risk of cancer (cancer vs. control) was the most common
comparison, whereas reports of initiation (pre-cancer vs. control) and
progression (cancer vs. pre-cancer) were rare. Case-series and joint-effect of
HPV and genotype on risk was evaluated frequently, but the independent effect of 
either risk factor alone was rarely provided. P53-Arg72Pro was the most commonly 
studied polymorphism studied. No consistent interaction was detected by
meta-analysis in the HPV(+) [OR 0.98 (0.55-1.76)] or the HPV(-) [OR 1.10
(0.76-1.60)] subsets in head and neck cancer risk. Polymorphisms in genes known
to encode proteins that physically interact with HPV were infrequently studied.
CONCLUSION: No consistent polymorphism-HPV interactions were observed. Study
design, choice of candidate polymorphisms/genes, and a focus on overall risk
rather than any specific portions of the carcinogenic pathway may have
contributed to lack of significant findings.
