OBJECTIVE: Cancer of an unknown primary (CUP) squamous cell carcinoma metastatic 
to cervical lymph nodes is a challenging problem for the treating physician. Our 
aim is to determine if identification of the primary tumor is associated with
improved oncologic outcomes and/or tumor characteristics including human
papilloma virus (HPV) status.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, matched-pairs analysis contrasting 2 cohorts based
upon discovery of primary lesion.
SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Records of 136 patients initially diagnosed as carcinoma of
unknown primary were retrospectively reviewed (1980-2010) and divided into 2
cohorts based on discovery of the primary lesion. Primary outcome measures were
overall survival and time to recurrence according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. A
nested subset of 22 patients in which the primary was discovered were matched to 
22 patients remaining undiscovered according to nodal stage and age.
RESULTS: Discovered lesions were more likely to exhibit HPV positivity (P <
.001). Matched-pairs analyses demonstrated that discovery of the primary was
associated with better overall survival (HR = 0.125; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.019-0.822; P = .030). Discovery of the primary was associated with
improved cause-specific survival (HR = 0.142; 95% CI, 0.021-0.93; P = .0418) and 
disease-free survival (HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.069-0.91; P = .03).
CONCLUSION: HPV positivity is associated with discovery of the primary tumor.
Discovery of the primary lesion is associated with improved overall survival,
cause-specific survival, and disease-free survival in patients initially
presenting as CUP in matched-pair and cohort comparison analyses.
