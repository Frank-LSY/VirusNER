BACKGROUND: Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have excess risk of
various cancer types. However, the total burden of human papillomavirus-related
cancers remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed a nationwide observational cohort study during
1994-2010.For each person with ESRD, we sampled 19 population controls (without
ESRD) matched on age, gender and municipality. Participants were followed until
first diagnosis of human papillomavirus-related cancer, death, emigration, or 31 
December 2010, whichever came first.Human papillomavirus-related cancers were
extracted from Danish medical administrative databases. We considered cancers of 
the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and subsets of head and neck cancers as
human papillomavirus-related. We calculated incidence rates of human
papillomavirus-related cancer and used Poisson regression to identify risk
factors for human papillomavirus-related cancer.
RESULTS: Among 12,293 persons with ESRD and 229,524 population controls we
identified 62 and 798 human papillomavirus-related cancers, respectively.
Incidence rates of human papillomavirus-related- cancer were 102 per 100,000
person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]; 79.5-131) among persons with ESRD and
40.8 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI; 38.1-43.7) among population controls. ESRD
patients had 4.54 (95% CI, 2.48-8.31) fold increased risk of anal cancer and 5.81
fold (95% CI; 3.36-10.1) increased risk of vulvovaginal cancer. Adjusted for age,
comorbidity, and sex, ESRD patients had 2.41 (95% CI; 1.83-3.16) fold increased
risk of any human papillomavirus-related cancer compared with population
controls. Compared with dialysis patients renal transplant recipients had an
age-adjusted non-significant 1.53 (95% CI, 0.91-2.58) fold higher risk of human
papillomavirus-related cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with ESRD have excess risk of potentially
vaccine-preventable human papillomavirus-related cancers.
