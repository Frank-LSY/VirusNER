The human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to infect the tissues of the oropharynx as demonstrated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). HPV has also been shown to induce benign lymphoid hypertrophy. We sought to investigate an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the presence of HPV in palatine and lingual tonsillar oropharyngeal tissue.
