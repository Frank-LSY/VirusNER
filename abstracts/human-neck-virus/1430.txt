BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of squamous cell carcinomas of the
oropharynx (OP-SCC) are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and p16
overexpression. This subgroup proves better prognosis and survival but no
evidence exists on the correlation between HPV and p16 overexpression based on
diagnostic measures and definition of p16 overexpression. We evaluated means of
p16 and HPV diagnostics, and quantified overexpression of p16 in HPV-positive and
-negative OP-SCCs by mode of immunohistochemical staining of carcinoma cells.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1980 until
October 2012. We applied the following inclusion criteria: a minimum of 20 cases 
of site-specific OP-SCCs, and HPV and p16 results present. Studies were
categorised into three groups based on their definition of p16 overexpression:
verbal definition, nuclear and cytoplasmatic staining between 5 and 69%, and ≥70%
staining.
RESULTS: We identified 39 studies with available outcome data (n=3926): 22
studies (n=1980) used PCR, 6 studies (n=688) used ISH, and 11 studies (n=1258)
used both PCR and ISH for HPV diagnostics. The methods showed similar
HPV-positive results. Overall, 52.5% of the cases (n=2062) were HPV positive. As 
to p16 overexpression, 17 studies (n=1684) used a minimum of 5-69% staining, and 
7 studies (n=764) used ≥70% staining. Fifteen studies (n=1478) referred to a
verbal definition. Studies showed high heterogeneity in diagnostics of HPV and
definition of p16. The correlation between HPV positivity and p16 overexpression 
proved best numerically in the group applying ≥70% staining for p16
overexpression. The group with verbal definitions had a significantly lower
false-positive rate, but along with the group applying 5-69% staining showed a
worse sensitivity compared with ≥70% staining.
CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial differences in how studies diagnose HPV and
define p16 overexpression. Numerically, p16 staining is better to predict the
presence of HPV (i.e. larger sensitivity), when the cutoff is set at ≥70% of
cytoplasmatic and nuclear staining.
