OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between human
papillomavirus infection and salivary gland tumours in a Scottish cohort.
METHODS: Specimens from a range of salivary gland tumours operated on between
1997 and 2012 were studied. A tissue microarray constructed from tissue blocks
was subjected to p16INK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A)
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation using probes specific for human
papillomavirus, including types 16 and 18.
RESULTS: A total of 61 tumours (benign and malignant) were deemed suitable for
the study. p16INK4 staining yielded three (4.9 per cent) positive samples: one
small cell carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma and one poorly differentiated
carcinoma. Human papillomavirus in situ hybridisation demonstrated a positive
signal in the latter sample only (1.6 per cent).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a very low human papillomavirus detection
rate in salivary gland tumours. It can therefore be concluded that human
papillomavirus infection is unlikely to play a role in salivary gland neoplasia. 
Rare human papillomavirus positive cases should be carefully evaluated to exclude
the possibility of a metastatic lesion.
