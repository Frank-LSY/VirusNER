BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) is emerging as a different subtype of head and neck cancer. The 
authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the predictive
role of HPV in patients with OSCC treated with radiotherapy-based modality
therapy.
METHODS: The authors performed a PubMed search to identify published trials that 
evaluated the outcome of HPV+ OSCC treated with radiotherapy. Hazard ratios (HRs)
were extracted and pooled by using random or fixed effects models. The primary
endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, (DSS), and
disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: Thirty trials were available for HPV analysis. HPV+ status is associated
with better OS (HR = 0.33; p < .00001), DSS (HR = 0.24; p < .00001), and DFS
(HR = 0.31; p < .00001).
CONCLUSION: HPV+ OSCC has a better survival compared to HPV-negative disease when
treated with radiotherapy-based modality therapy.
