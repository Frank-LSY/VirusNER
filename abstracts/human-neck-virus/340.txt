BACKGROUND: Human enteroviruses (HEVs) and rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been linked
to acute otitis media (AOM).
OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluates the aforementioned association in a birth
cohort setting.
STUDY DESIGN: The cohort included 286 healthy infants (191 boys) followed from
birth up to the age of 2 years in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention
study in Finland. Stool samples were collected monthly and analyzed for the
presence of HRV and HEV RNA using RT-PCR. Clinical symptoms were recorded by a
questionnaire every 3-6 months.
RESULTS: Altogether 610 AOM episodes were reported during the follow-up. 9.8% of 
the stool samples were positive for HRV and 6.8% for HEV. HRV positivity peaked
at the age of 3-6 months declining gradually after this age, whereas HEV
positivity peaked later, at the age of 12-24 months. The risk of AOM was
increased in children who were HEV positive at least once at the age of 6-12
months (OR 2.2 [95%CI 1.1-4.2], P=0.023) or who were HRV positive at least once
at the age of 18-24 months (OR 2.3 [95%CI 1.0-5.2], P=0.042). Having an older
sibling, short breast-feeding and maternal smoking during pregnancy were also
significantly associated with AOM.
CONCLUSIONS: HRV and HEV infections are frequent during the first months of life.
The observed trend for increased risk of AOM in HRV and HEV positive children is 
in line with the results from hospital series suggesting that these viruses may
play an independent role in the pathogenesis of AOM.
