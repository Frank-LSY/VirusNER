OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, outcome and diagnosis of two 
cases of imported children Zika virus infection in China.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical characteristics,
treatment and outcome of two cases of imported children with Zika virus infection
in February 2016 in Enping People's Hospital of Guangdong.
RESULT: Two cases of children with imported Zika virus infection resided in an
affected area of Venezuela, 8-year-old girl and her 6 year-old brother. The main 
findings on physical examination included the following manifestations: fever,
rash, and conjunctivitis. The rash was first limited to the abdomen, but extended
to the torso, neck and face, and faded after 3-4 d. The total number of white
blood cells was not high and liver function was normal. The diagnosis of two
cases of Zika virus infection was confirmed by the expert group of Guangdong
Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the
epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and Zika virus nucleic acid
detection results.Treatment of Zika virus infection involves supportive care. Two
Zika virus infection children had a relatively benign outcome.
CONCLUSION: At present, Zika virus infection in children is an imported disease
in China. No specific therapy is available for this disease. Information on
long-term outcomes among infants and children with Zika virus disease is limited,
routine pediatric care is advised for these infants and children.
