BACKGROUND: HPV-related head and neck cancer rates have been increasing in recent
years, with the tonsils being the most commonly affected site. However, the
current rate of HPV infection in the pediatric population remains poorly defined.
The objective of this study was to systematically review and evaluate the
prevalence and distribution of HPV in the tonsils of pediatric patients
undergoing routine tonsillectomy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The literature was searched using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus,
CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global databases
(inception to December 2017) by two independent review authors. Inclusion
criteria included articles which evaluated the prevalence of HPV in a pediatric
cohort without known warts or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, those which
used tonsil biopsy specimens for analysis, and those with six or more subjects
and clear outcomes reported. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Using the
Oxford Clinical Evidence-based Medicine (OCEBM) guidelines, two reviewers
appraised the level of evidence of each study, extracted data, and resolved
discrepancies by consensus. The systematic review identified 11 articles
(n = 2520). Seven studies detected HPV in the subject population, with prevalence
values ranging from 0 to 21%. The level of evidence for all included studies was 
OCEBM Level 3.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV may be present in pediatric tonsillectomy specimens; however,
the largest included study demonstrated a prevalence of 0%. Future testing should
be performed using methods with high sensitivities and specificities, such as
reverse transcript real-time PCR or digital droplet PCR.
