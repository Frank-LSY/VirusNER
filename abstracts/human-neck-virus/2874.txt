OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome and
treatment-related morbidity in pediatric patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC) treated with chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: We did a retrospective review of 41 pediatric patients diagnosed with
NPC between 2000 and 2013. The majority of the patients were treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation with the dose of
70 Gy in 35 fractions. Eight patients were treated with intensity-modulated
radiation therapy, while the remaining with three-dimensional conformal radiation
therapy or two-dimensional simulation technique.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 14 years (range 6-20 years). Most of 
the patients had locoregionally advanced disease (stage III/IVA/IVB). The
histology of all the cases was undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry
for the Epstein-Barr virus-Latent membrane protein 1 was positive in nine of the 
13 tested cases. The median follow-up for all and the surviving patients was 26.6
months (range 2-140.8) and 51.2 months, respectively. The 3-year overall survival
(OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were estimated at 83.7% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 64.8-93%) and 55.8% (95%CI: 38.7-69.8%), respectively. Distant
metastases were the predominant pattern of failure. Treatment response showed an 
independent association with OS. T classification (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) was
significantly associated with EFS. Xerostomia, hypothyroidism, dental caries,
neck fibrosis, trismus, and dysphagia were the common late effects in survivors. 
Radiation myelitis was observed in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent
chemoradiation provides good survival outcomes in pediatric NPC. The quality of
life of the survivors is a pertinent area that necessitates consideration.
