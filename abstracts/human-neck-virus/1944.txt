BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes oropharyngeal and cervical cancers.
Oropharyngeal cancer primarily affects whites, but cervical cancer is more common
among blacks. Reasons for this distinct epidemiology are unclear.
METHODS: Serum was collected from women aged 35 to 60 years in the HPV in
Perimenopause cohort and evaluated for antibodies to 8 HPV types. Demographic and
behavioral data were collected by telephone questionnaire. Associations between
sexual behaviors, race, age, HPV serostatus, and strength of serologic response
to HPV were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 781 women in this analysis, including 620 white (79%) and 161
(21%) black women. Whites were less likely to report 5+ vaginal sex partners
(prevalence ratio [PR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.97), but more 
likely to report 5+ oral sex partners (PR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.62-3.49) compared with
blacks. Seropositivity to most individual HPV types and at least 3 types was
significantly lower in whites than in blacks (PR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.80). Human
papillomavirus seropositivity was independently associated with younger age among
blacks, but with sexual exposures among whites. Furthermore, strength of
serologic response to most HPV types significantly decreased with older age among
blacks, but not among whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in immune markers of HPV exposure and the
epidemiology of HPV-related cancers may be linked to differences in patterns of
sexual behaviors.
