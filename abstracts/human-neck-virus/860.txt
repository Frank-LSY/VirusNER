Approximately 25% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) worldwide are 
associated with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV). HPV-positive HNSCCs have 
a more favorable outcome and greater response to therapy. While chronic HPV
infection allows for the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms, viral antigens
can still elicit an immune response. Moreover, a robust lymphocytic response is
associated with better prognosis in a variety of tumor types including head and
neck cancer. This article outlines several mechanisms whereby the observed
improved response of HPV-positive tumors to radiotherapy may be related to
enhancement of the immune response following radiotherapy.
