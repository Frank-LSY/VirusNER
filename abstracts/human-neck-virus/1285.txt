INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze acute
toxicity encountered in young and old patients treated with chemo-radiation or
bio-radiation at the S. Croce General Hospital between 1997 and 2008, in daily
clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen patients were allocated into
two groups according to age (cut-off 65 years). The two groups were compared in
terms of treatment related toxicities, treatment activity and efficacy. Epidermal
Growth factor receptor (EGFr), Human papillomavirus (HPV) and p53 status were
also considered.
RESULTS: As expected, overall survival was significantly worse in elderly
patients (p=0.005), but response rate, including complete response rate, was
similar between the two age groups, as were most of the side effects analyzed.
However, infections (p=0.011) and in particular pneumonias (p=0.002) were
significantly more represented in elderly patients.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients treated with chemo-radiation or bio-radiation in our
centre had a higher risk of infection and in particular, pneumonia. These data
suggest a more careful follow-up, but age alone does not justify their exclusion 
from treatment.
