The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal squamous
cell cancer (OSCC) is on the rise. With the HPV-positive uterine cervix as a
reservoir, HPV-positive OSCC is discussed as a sexually transmitted disease.
Mechanisms of HPV transmission to the oral cavity are poorly understood. To gain 
more insight into HPV-transmission routes, cervically HPV-positive women and
their sexual partners are screened for oral HPV infection. Women with cervical
dysplasia underwent HPV testing of the uterine cervix and tonsillar region via
brush test. In addition, sexual partners received oral HPV testing. Tonsillar
brush tests of patients admitted for routine surgery served as the control group.
The HPV-PCR (Roche Linear Array Kit) was used to differentiate 37 HPV types. All 
participants completed a risk-factor questionnaire focusing on sexual habits. 101
women were tested HPV-positive at the cervix. Only 3/101 (3 %) were tested
HPV-positive in the oropharynx. In 60/101 (60 %) women the sexual partner could
be tested for oral HPV infection: testing was positive in 3/60 (5 %). No oral HPV
was detected in the control group. The risk-factor questionnaire revealed
significant differences between the female study- and control group in terms of
age at first sexual intercourse and smoking habits. The limited data suggest that
among sexual partners in Germany, HPV transmission to the oropharynx by
oral-genital sex or by autoinoculation is a rare and unlikely event with low HPV 
concordance. Another explanation for the low oral prevalence could be an
independent clearance of HPV from the oropharyngeal site compared to cervix uteri
or at different time intervals.
