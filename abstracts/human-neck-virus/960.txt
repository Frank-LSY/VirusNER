Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been etiologically linked to a subset of head 
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), generally arising in young patients
without a history of tobacco smoking or alcohol use. These tumors typically lack 
mutations in TP53 and may show enhanced sensitivity to chemoradiation therapy
with a correspondingly better overall prognosis. The determination of the HPV
status in HNSCC therefore has therapeutic implications. We compared the Ventana
ISH iView Blue Plus Detection Kit in situ hybridization (ISH) system and the
Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test for the detection of HPV in 98
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HNSCC samples. A moderate concordance rate
(70.4%) was observed between ISH and the Linear Array assays. ISH detected HPV in
39.8% of cases, whereas Linear Array detected HPV in 57.1% of cases. Sensitivity 
and specificity of ISH for detecting HPV in HNSCC specimens were determined to be
58.9% and 85.7%, respectively, using the Linear Array as the method of comparison
(McNemar test, P=0.003). ISH offers the advantage of visual cell-type
localization of viral infection but overall it is less sensitive than the
polymerase chain reaction-based detection of HPV in HNSCC.
