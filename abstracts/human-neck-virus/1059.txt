We present an optimized triple modality reporter construct combining a far-red
fluorescent protein (E2-Crimson), enhanced firefly luciferase enzyme (Luc2), and 
truncated wild type herpes simplex virus I thymidine kinase (wttk) that allows
for sensitive, long-term tracking of tumor growth in vivo by fluorescence,
bioluminescence, and positron emission tomography. Two human cancer cell lines
(MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cancer) were successfully
transduced to express this triple modality reporter. Fluorescence and
bioluminescence imaging of the triple modality reporter were used to accurately
quantify the therapeutic responses of MDA-MB-231 tumors to the chemotherapeutic
agent monomethyl auristatin E in vivo in athymic nude mice. Positive correlation 
was observed between the fluorescence and bioluminescence signals, and these
signals were also positively correlated with the ex vivo tumor weights. This is
the first reported use of both fluorescence and bioluminescence signals from a
multi-modality reporter construct to measure drug efficacy in vivo.
