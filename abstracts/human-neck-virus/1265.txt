BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
is among the most promising molecular therapeutics for Head and Neck Squamous
Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). However, drug resistance limits the clinical efficacy of 
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and no predictive biomarker has entered the
clinic yet.
METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was performed utilizing pathological
specimens from 52 newly diagnosed HNSCC patients. These patients were screened
for mutations in EGFR and KRAS. Tyrosine kinase mutations in EGFR and KRAS
mutations were evaluated by high resolution melting analysis (HRMA), whereas
EGFRvIII was determined using one-step real-time PCR. Finally, patient samples
were screened for HPV-DNA by GP5+/6+ PCR. Survival analysis was performed using
Kaplan-Meier analysis and significance was calculated using log-rank statistic.
RESULTS: In our study population no EGFRvIII mutations were present. However, two
silent mutations were found; T785T in exon 20 and R836R in exon 21 of the EGFR
gene. Additionally, HRMA revealed an abnormal KRAS melting pattern in 7.0% of the
samples. However, the KRAS StripAssay could confirm only one sample with a G12S
mutation and none of these samples could be confirmed by direct sequencing. HPV
DNA was present in 3/25 larynx and 9/27 oropharynx tumors.
CONCLUSION: The low rate of EGFR and KRAS mutations in this Belgian HNSCC
population suggests that these genes will probably not play a major role in
predicting response to anti-EGFR therapy in HNSCC. Hence, other predictive
markers need to be discovered in order to optimize EGFR targeting therapy.
