PURPOSE: Current classification of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
based on anatomic site and stage fails to capture biologic heterogeneity or
adequately inform treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we use gene expression-based consensus clustering,
copy number profiling, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status on a clinically
homogenous cohort of 134 locoregionally advanced HNSCCs with 44% HPV(+) tumors
together with additional cohorts, which in total comprise 938 tumors, to identify
HNSCC subtypes and discover several subtype-specific, translationally relevant
characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified five subtypes of HNSCC, including two biologically
distinct HPV subtypes. One HPV(+) and one HPV(-) subtype show a prominent immune 
and mesenchymal phenotype. Prominent tumor infiltration with CD8(+) lymphocytes
characterizes this inflamed/mesenchymal subtype, independent of HPV status.
Compared with other subtypes, the two HPV subtypes show low expression and no
copy number events for EGFR/HER ligands. In contrast, the basal subtype is
uniquely characterized by a prominent EGFR/HER signaling phenotype, negative
HPV-status, as well as strong hypoxic differentiation not seen in other subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Our five-subtype classification provides a comprehensive overview of 
HPV(+) as well as HPV(-) HNSCC biology with significant translational
implications for biomarker development and personalized care for patients with
HNSCC.
