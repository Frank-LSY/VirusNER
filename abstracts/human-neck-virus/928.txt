The original hygiene hypothesis declares "more infections in early childhood
protect against later atopy". According to the hygiene hypothesis, the increased 
incidence of allergic disorders in developed countries is explained by the
decrease of infections. Epithelial cells and dendritic cells play key roles in
bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems. Among the various
pattern-recognition receptor systems of epithelial cells and dendritic cells,
including toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and others, TLRs are the key systems of immune
response regulation. In humans, TLRs consist of TLR1 to TLR10. They regulate
cellular responses through engagement with TLR ligands, e.g., lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) acts through TLR4 and dsRNA acts through TLR3, but there are certain common
components between these two TLR pathways. dsRNA activates epithelial cells and
dendritic cells in different directions, resulting in allergy-related Th2-skewing
tendency in epithelial cells, and Th1-skewing tendency in dendritic cells. The
Th2-skewing effect by stimulation of dsRNA on epithelial cells could be
suppressed by the presence of LPS above some threshold. When LPS level decreases,
the Th2-skewing effect increases. It may be via these interrelated networks and
related factors that LPS modifies the allergic responses and provides a plausible
mechanism of the hygiene hypothesis. Several hygiene hypothesis-related
phenomena, seemingly conflicting, are also discussed in this review, along with
their proposed mechanisms.
