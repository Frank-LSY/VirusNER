OBJECTIVES: Lymph node ratio (LNR) is an established predictor in different
entities of carcinoma, including head and neck malignancies. In oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), lymph node involvement differs between human
papilloma virus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative tumours. Herein, we evaluate the 
impact of HPV association on the concept of LNR.
METHODS: 88 surgically treated patients were included in this retrospective chart
review. HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC were evaluated for prediction of
outcome by LNR separately. The endpoints were 5-year overall survival (OS) and
recurrence-free survival (RFS).
RESULTS: The OS of all patients was 60.1%. In univariate analysis, LNR was a
significant predictor of overall survival rate (P=.008) in OPSCC independently of
the HPV status, as well as extracapsular spread (ECS). T-classification was only 
a significant predictor in the univariate analysis in HPV-positive OPSCC
carcinoma. However, in the multivariate analysis LNR remained predictor of
prognosis in all OPSCC and in HPV-negative OPSCC. In patients with HPV-positive
OPSCC, only T-classification reached significance to predict OS.
CONCLUSION: Prognosis of primarily operated HPV-positive patients might be more
dependent on the extent of primary tumour site, whereas prognosis of HPV-negative
patients is based more on cervical metastatic spread, represented by LNR.
