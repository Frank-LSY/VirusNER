Notes from the field: false-positive measles test - Maine, February 2012.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

On February 7, 2012, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention was
notified of suspected measles infection in an unvaccinated woman aged 57 years.
The patient went to her medical provider on January 30 after 3 days of headache
and fever and 2 days of papular rash. The rash began on her neck and spread to
her abdomen, legs, and back. Two days later she developed coryza and cough. The
rash resolved by February 6. A serum specimen collected on January 31
demonstrated a high titer of measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) and was positive for 
measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) on testing at a reference laboratory.
