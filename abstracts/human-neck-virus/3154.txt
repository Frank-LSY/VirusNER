Acute rhinosinusitis is a common ailment accounting for millions of office visits
annually, including that of Mrs D, a 51-year-old woman presenting with 5 days of 
upper respiratory illness and facial pain. Her case is used to review the
diagnosis and treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Acute viral rhinosinusitis can
be difficult to distinguish from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially
during the first 10 days of symptoms. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines
developed to guide diagnosis and treatment of acute viral and bacterial
rhinosinusitis recommend that the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis be based on
the presence of "cardinal symptoms" of purulent rhinorrhea and either facial
pressure or nasal obstruction of less than 4 weeks' duration. Antibiotic
treatment generally can be withheld during the first 10 days of symptoms for mild
to moderate cases, given the likelihood of acute viral rhinosinusitis or of
spontaneously resolving acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. After 10 days, the
likelihood of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis increases, and initiation of
antibiotic therapy is supported by practice guidelines. Complications of
sinusitis, though rare, can be serious and require early recognition and
treatment.
