Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have distinct mutation and copy-number
profiles depending on human papillomavirus status. Although several challenges
remain in biomarker implementation and clinical trial feasibility, incorporating 
available genomic data will expedite the development of novel therapeutics and
predictive biomarker-driven clinical trials. See related article by Seiwert et
al., p. 632.
