Meningitis is a disease feared by parents and health professionals alike. The
rapid onset and progression of the disease and potentially lethal outcome makes
it vital to diagnose the disease early, but this can be difficult. This is
particularly the case during the current swine flu pandemic, where concerns have 
been raised that cases of meningitis may be missed due to a misdiagnosis of swine
flu. Early symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia often resemble viral illnesses 
such as influenza, making the condition difficult to diagnose. Classic symptoms
(the ones that many health professionals and lay people most commonly associate
with meningitis), such as a nonblanching rash and a stiff neck, are often late
symptoms of the disease and neck stiffness is rarer in infants and young
children. The presence of ear or upper respiratory tract infections does not
necessarily exclude a diagnosis of meningitis. The emphasis should therefore be
on regular, close monitoring of an ill child and assessment of the vital signs.
Awareness of the recognised "red flag" symptoms of septicaemia--cold hands and
feet, limb pain and pale or mottled skin--could also aid earlier diagnosis and
hence potentially improve prognosis.
