BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has gradually increased in the 
recent 20 years in the whole world. Although the mortality decreased
significantly in recent years, it was still high, especially in patients with
persistent infection. Therefore, we compare differences of clinical features
between persistent and nonpersistent CM patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of patients
diagnosed with CM from January 2000 to December 2011 in four centers in China,
including demographic features, underlying diseases, clinical presentations,
laboratory data, and so on.
RESULTS: Of 106 CM patients enrolled, 16 were identified as persistent cases.
Among all variables, persistent CM patients were more like to be human
immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection (P < 0.05), stiff neck (P < 0.01), a
serum hemoglobin < 90 g/L (P < 0.01), a serum potassium concentration <2.7 mg/L
(P < 0.01), an intracranial pressure (ICP) >400 mmH2 O (P < 0.01), and a latex
agglutination cryptococcal antigen titer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF LACT)
>1:1024 (P < 0.01) than nonpersistent ones. A multivariate analysis showed that
HIV infection (OR 7.49), stiff neck (OR 11.7), a serum potassium <2.7 mmol/L (OR 
9.45), and an ICP >400 mmH2 O (OR 6.83) were closely correlated with persistent
CM.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is difficult to deal with persistent CM nowadays, some
cases could be predicted early enough in the future, so as to be treated
appropriately and have relatively good outcomes.
