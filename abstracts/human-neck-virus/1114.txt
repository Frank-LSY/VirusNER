Knowledge about HPV infection in the oral cavity/oropharynx may contribute to the
elucidation of the role it plays in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
(HNSCC).OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the methodology used for
sampling the oral cavity and oropharynx mucosae and to determine the prevalence
of HPV in the oral cavity and oropharynx of adults and children.
METHOD: The study population was served by an assistance program in a rural
district of São Paulo. The subjects were asked to donate samples regardless of
complaints.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study included 47 men, 77 women and 22 children, of
which the oral cavity samples were obtained by gargling with
commercially-available antiseptic mouthwash. We found 3 positive samples (2.4%)
in adults: 2 HPV 55 and one HPV 58. No positive results were found in children.
Furthermore we concluded that the sampling method with the mouthwash proved
effective and fast for the detection of HPV in the oral cavity and oropharynx in 
the general population.
