To determine whether measuring antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
glycoprotein gH/gL in serum could improve diagnostic accuracy in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) cases, gH/gL expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system was
used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies in two 
independent cohorts. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed using
results from a training cohort (n = 406) to establish diagnostic mathematical
models, which were validated in a second independent cohort (n = 279). Levels of 
serum gH/gL antibodies were higher in NPC patients than in healthy controls (p < 
0.001). In the training cohort, the IgA-gH/gL ELISA had a sensitivity of 83.7%,
specificity of 82.3% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893 (95% CI,
0.862-0.924) for NPC diagnosis. Furthermore, gH/gL maintained diagnostic capacity
in IgA-VCA negative NPC patients (sensitivity = 78.1%, specificity = 82.3%, AUC =
0.879 [95% CI, 0.820 - 0.937]). Combining gH/gL and viral capsid antigen (VCA)
detection improved diagnostic capacity as compared to individual tests alone in
both the training cohort (sensitivity = 88.5%, specificity = 97%, AUC = 0.98 [95%
CI, 0.97 - 0.991]), and validation cohort (sensitivity = 91.2%, specificity =
96.5%, AUC = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.951-0.988]). These findings suggest that EBV gH/gL
detection complements VCA detection in the diagnosis of NPC and aids in the
identification of patients with VCA-negative NPC.
