Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is rapidly evolving due
to changing patient populations, an emphasis on quality of life-related outcomes,
and advances in radiotherapy concepts and techniques to meet these new demands.
This review includes recent and ongoing studies that are potentially practice
changing, including improvements in intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning,
the use of deintensified regimens in the human papilloma virus-related setting,
and adjuvant therapy after transoral robotic surgery. Additionally, recent
studies of modern proton therapy are reviewed.
