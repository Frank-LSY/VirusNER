Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to chronic airway inflammation, and
NADPH oxidase (Nox) is an important source of ROS. However, little is known of
the role that ROS play in chronic upper respiratory tract inflammation. We
investigated the mechanism of ROS generation and its association with mucin gene 
overexpression in the nasal epithelium. The level of platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) expression was increased in sinusitis mucosa, and high-level PDGF
expression induced intracellular ROS, followed by MUC8 gene overexpression in
normal human nasal epithelial cells. Knockdown of Nox4 expression with Nox4 siRNA
decreased PDGF-induced intracellular ROS and MUC8 expression. Infection with an
adenovirus containing Nox4 cDNA resulted in Nox4 overexpression and increased
intracellular levels of ROS and MUC8 expression. PDGF and Nox4 overexpression are
essential components of intracellular ROS generation and may contribute to
chronic inflammation in the nasal epithelium through induction of MUC8
overexpression.
