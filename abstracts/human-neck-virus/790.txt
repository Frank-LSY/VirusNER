Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer worldwide
predominately associated with tobacco use. Changing cause and increased incidence
in oropharyngeal carcinomas is associated with high-risk types of human papilloma
virus and has an improved survival. Optical devices may augment visual oral
examination; however, their lack of specificity still warrants tissue
evaluation/biopsy. Histologic factors of oral carcinomas are critical for patient
management and prognostic determination. Clinical biomarkers are still needed to 
improve early detection, predict malignant transformation, and optimize
therapies.
