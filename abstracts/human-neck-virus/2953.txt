CONCLUSION: Delayed facial palsy after tympanoplasty had no predisposition for
gender or side. It seemed that prednisolone alone without antiviral drugs was
enough for the treatment of delayed facial palsy after tympanoplasty.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of delayed
facial palsy after tympanoplasty.
METHODS: The cases with delayed facial palsy after tympanoplasty treated from
January 2005 to January 2014 at our hospital were included in the study, and
their clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The incidence of delayed facial palsy after tympanoplasty was 1.1%
(16/1420 cases). Facial palsy occurred between 5 and 14 days (average 7.4 Â± 1.8
days) after surgery. The incidence of delayed facial palsy was not different
between males and females (p > 0.05). Also there was no significant difference
between left and right side (p > 0.05). All patients were treated by prednisolone
alone, and their facial nerve recovered to HB grade I after 3 weeks to 2 months
without any sequelae.
