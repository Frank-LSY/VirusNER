OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to clarify the human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection status of various laryngeal diseases in Tokyo, Japan.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study.
METHODS: A total of 144 patients who underwent surgical resection for various
laryngeal lesions were enrolled in this study. These subjects were categorized
into four groups based on lesion type: non-neoplastic, 44; precancerous, 29;
cancer, 35; and papilloma, 36. To determine the rate of HPV infection, laryngeal 
secretions and resected tissue from our study participants were examined by
liquid-phase hybridization (LPH) and consensus primer-directed polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: The LPH for low-risk HPV was applied to all 144 patients, and that for
high-risk HPV was additionally applied to 121 of the 144 patients. The PCR was
applied to 94 of the 144 patients. The LPH detected low-risk HPV-DNA in 23
patients (1 cancer and 22 papillomas) and high-risk HPV-DNA in 3 patients (1
cancer and 2 papillomas). The PCR detected HPV-6 and HPV-11 in the papilloma
group, whereas it detected HPV-31 in one patient with laryngeal cancer and one
patient with precancerous lesion. Both the LPH and the PCR revealed the HPV
infection rate in the non-neoplastic group to be 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no significant difference in the HPV-DNA positive 
rates of laryngeal cancer and precancerous lesions in the non-neoplastic group,
the positive rates were significantly smaller in this group than in the papilloma
group. In the Tokyo area, HPV had little or no association with laryngeal cancer,
precancerous lesions, and non-neoplastic lesions in the larynx.
