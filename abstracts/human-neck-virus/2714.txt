The common cold is one of the most frequent human inflammatory diseases caused by
viruses and can facilitate bacterial superinfections, resulting in sinusitis or
pneumonia. The active ingredient of the drug Soledum, 1,8-cineole, is commonly
applied for treating inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. However, the
potential for 1,8-cineole to treat primary viral infections of the respiratory
tract remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time
that 1,8-cineole potentiates poly(I:C)-induced activity of the antiviral
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), while simultaneously 
reducing proinflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity in human cell lines,
inferior turbinate stem cells (ITSCs) and in ex vivo cultivated human nasal
mucosa. Co-treatment of cell lines with poly(I:C) and 1,8-cineole resulted in
significantly increased IRF3 reporter gene activity compared with poly(I:C)
alone, whereas NF-κB activity was reduced. Accordingly, 1,8-cineole- and
poly(I:C) treatment led to increased nuclear translocation of IRF3 in ITSCs and a
human ex vivo model of rhinosinusitis compared with the poly(I:C) treatment
approach. Nuclear translocation of IRF3 was significantly increased in ITSCs and 
slice cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1,8-cineole compared
with the LPS-treated cells mimicking bacterial infection. Our findings strongly
suggest that 1,8-cineole potentiates the antiviral activity of IRF3 in addition
to its inhibitory effect on proinflammatory NF-κB signalling, and may thus
broaden its field of application.
