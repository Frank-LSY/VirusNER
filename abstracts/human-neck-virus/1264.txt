Currently, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) are treated based on
the traditional TNM-classification, although this scheme might be inadequate for 
the subgroup of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated OPSCCs. It remains
debatable whether this subgroup of patients with favorable prognosis should be
offered altered treatment. Besides the well-known biomarkers of HPV and p16, new 
promising immune cells and markers might nuance the prognosis and treatment for
patients with HPV+ OPSCC. We systematically reviewed the literature on
immunological features of HPV-associated OPSCCs, and report that a high number of
cytotoxic T cells (CD8s) and a low number of CD98 positive cells is associated
with better outcome, while an increased CD4/CD8 ratio and a high human leukocyte 
antigen 1 (HLA1) intensity is most likely associated with worse outcome. These
findings might contribute to future OPSCC staging and treatment.
