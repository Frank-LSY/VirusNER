BACKGROUND: Local recurrence is the major cause of treatment failure in patients 
who undergo surgical salvage of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after
radiotherapy. The authors investigated the role of Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-encoded Bam HI-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (BART7) status in
resection margins in the identification of a subgroup of patients who may benefit
from adjuvant reradiation after surgery.
METHODS: One hundred two consecutive patients who had histologically clear
resection margins after undergoing nasopharyngectomy for recurrent NPC were
studied. The status of EBV microRNA BART7 in resection margins was investigated
and correlated with the pattern of subsequent disease recurrence.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 64 months, 20 patients (19.6%) developed
local recurrence after surgery despite histologically uninvolved margins. The
risk of local recurrence in patients with histologically close (<5 mm) and clear 
(≥5 mm) margins was 31.6% and 12.5%, respectively. In patients with clear
histologic margins, those with margins that were positive for EBV microRNA BART7 
has a significantly higher chance of developing local tumor recurrence (P = .016)
than those with negative molecular margins. The difference was not significant
when the histologic clearance at the resection margins was <5 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: Tissue EBV microRNA BART7 is useful for identifying a subgroup of
patients with histologically clear margins who are at increased risk of
subsequent local tumor recurrence. Postoperative adjuvant treatment is warranted 
for these patients.
