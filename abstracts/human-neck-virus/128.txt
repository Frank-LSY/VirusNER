BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus oral infection can be related to several
factors including HIV infection, cigarette smoking, marijuana consumption and
number of sexual partners. We conducted a study on oral HPV prevalence and
clearance among the hosts of the San Patrignano community, a population
considered at "high-risk" for HPV due to their previous habits.
METHODS: From March 2007 to September 2010 all subjects were submitted to
oropharyngeal brushing and saliva collection at baseline, after 6, 12 and 48
months (for subjects HPV positive at baseline). Samples were analyzed to detect
HPV DNA and virus genotypes. The correlation between HPV prevalence and
demographic, behavioral or immunological characteristics was assessed.
RESULTS: Among 194 subjects, 30 (15%) were HPV positive with 25 (13%) high-risk
(HR)-HPV at baseline brushing. At 12 months HPV infection was cleared in all
cases. However at 48 months HPV was newly detected in 33% of subjects. A
correlation between time spent in the community and increase in the ratio of
"low-risk" (LR) HPV and HR-HPV was observed. HPV infection was not associated
with age, gender, HIV status, HCV, alcohol and/or drug exposure, number of years 
spent in community, sex with drug-addicts and condom use. Only AIDS under
antiretroviral treatment was inversely correlated with the risk of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year a complete HPV clearance was observed which could be
related to adoption of healthier lifestyles of participants. New HPV infections
were detected even in the absence of the recognized and declared risky behavioral
factors, suggesting a re-expression from a latent infection.
