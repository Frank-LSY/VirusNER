BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nasal cavity is a rare
malignancy and often analyzed in heterogeneous studies with other tumors of the
nose or the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate distinct
risk factors, tumor characteristics, outcome predictors, and the prevalence of
human papillomavirus (HPV) in SCC of the nasal cavity.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 39 patients treated at a single
quaternary medical care and cancer center. We analyzed tumor characteristics, HPV
status, treatment, and outcome. We present the largest study on SCC of the nasal 
cavity from a single center.
RESULTS: The majority of patients (70.2%) presented with an early-stage tumor (T1
or T2). Only 1 patient had a single neck metastasis at the time of diagnosis.
Four tumors were HPV-positive. Most patients (61.5%) underwent surgical resection
without adjuvant treatment, with 12 patients (30.8%) undergoing additional
radiotherapy. Three patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy. No patient treated primarily with total rhinectomy developed
local tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Local tumor control is crucial, even if it makes radical surgery
necessary. Postoperative epithetic treatment enables reliable follow-up
examinations. Regional metastases at the time of diagnosis are rare. Neck
dissection should therefore be reserved for cases of suspected metastasis. HPV
may also play a role in the etiology of SCC of the nasal cavity. © 2016 Wiley
