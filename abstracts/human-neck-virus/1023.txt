Plastic bronchitis (PB) is characterized by thick, inspissated, tracheobronchial 
casts. It is classified as either inflammatory or acellular based on the content 
of the endobronchial casts. PB has never been reported in a healthy child with
solitary influenza B infection. This study is a retrospective case series of two 
children who presented to our institution in acute respiratory distress.
Emergency rigid bronchoscopy was performed with extraction of casts from the L
mainstem bronchus in both patients. Influenza B was the only isolate identified. 
In otherwise healthy children with respiratory distress, influenza B-mediated
inflammatory PB must be considered in the differential diagnosis.
