BACKGROUND: Therapies targeted towards the tumour vasculature can be exploited
for the purpose of improving the systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses to
tumours. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved treatment for cancer
that is known to induce potent effects on tumour vasculature. In this study, we
examined the activity of PDT in combination with oncolytic vaccinia virus (OVV)
against primary and metastatic tumours in mice.
METHODS: The effect of 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl-]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a
(HPPH)-sensitised-PDT on the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy was investigated
against subcutaneously implanted syngeneic murine NXS2 neuroblastoma and human
FaDu head and neck squamous cell carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Treatment
efficacy was evaluated by monitoring tumour growth and survival. The effects of
combination treatment on vascular function were examined using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry, whereas viral replication in tumour cells
was analysed by a standard plaque assay. Normal tissue phototoxicity following
PDT-OV treatment was studied using the mouse foot response assay.
RESULTS: Combination of PDT with OVV resulted in inhibition of primary and
metastatic tumour growth compared with either monotherapy. PDT-induced vascular
disruption resulted in higher intratumoural viral titres compared with the
untreated tumours. Five days after delivery of OVV, there was a loss of blood
flow to the interior of tumour that was associated with infiltration of
neutrophils. Administration of OVV did not result in any additional photodynamic 
damage to normal mouse foot tissue.
CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence into the usefulness of PDT as a means 
of enhancing intratumoural replication and therapeutic efficacy of OV.
