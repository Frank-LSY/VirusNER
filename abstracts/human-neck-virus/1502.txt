PURPOSE: Previous studies examining the association of body mass index (BMI) with
risk of and survival from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been
inconsistent, although an inverse association has been noted for obesity and risk
of HNSCC in several studies. Previous studies have not examined whether these
associations differ by human papillomavirus (HPV) status.
METHODS: We utilized the resources of a population-based case-control study of
HNSCC from the greater Boston area (959 cases and 1,208 controls were eligible
for this analysis). Anthropometric history was collected through personal
interviews, and HPV status was assessed using serology. We analyzed the
association between BMI (assessed 5 years prior to disease incidence) and disease
risk and survival using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards
regression, respectively.
RESULTS: After adjusting for known risk factors, the association between obesity 
and overall risk of HNSCC was not significant (OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.60-1.04).
However, obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) was inversely associated with HNSCC risk among
HPV-seronegative cases (OR 0.48, 95 % CI 0.32-0.70), but not among
HPV-seropositive cases (OR 0.91, 95 % CI 0.68-1.21). BMI was not associated with 
survival overall or by HPV status. However, being overweight (BMI
25-29.9 kg/m(2)) was associated with longer survival among HPV-seropositive
smokers (HR 0.48, 95 % CI 0.31-0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with previous observations that obesity 
is inversely associated with the risk of HNSCC; however, this association appears
to be confined to HPV-seronegative cases. Overall, obesity was not associated
with HNSCC survival overall or by HPV status.
IMPACT: Obesity is associated with risk of non-HPV HNSCC, but not HPV HNSCC.
