APOBEC3 (A3) mutation signatures have been observed in a variety of human cancer 
genomes, including those of cervical and head and neck cancers caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, the driving forces that promote
off-target A3 activity remain mostly unclear. Here, we report a mechanism for the
dramatic increase of A3A protein levels in HPV-positive keratinocytes. We show
that expression of the viral protein E7 from high-risk HPVs, but not E7 from
low-risk HPVs, significantly prolongs the cellular half-life of A3A protein in
human keratinocytes and HPV-positive cancer cell lines. We have mapped several
residues within the cullin 2 (CUL2) binding motif of HPV16 E7 as being important 
for mediating A3A protein stabilization. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence 
that both A3A and HPV16 E7 interact with CUL2, suggesting that the E7-CUL2
complex formed during HPV infection may regulate A3A protein levels in the cell. 
Using an in vitro cytidine deaminase assay, we show that E7-stabilized A3A
remains catalytically active. Taken together, our findings suggest that the HPV
oncoprotein E7 dysregulates endogenous A3A protein levels and thus provides novel
mechanistic insight into cellular triggers of A3 mutations in HPV-positive
cancers.IMPORTANCE Human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally associated with over 5%
of all human malignancies. Several recent studies have shown that a subset of
cancers, including HPV-positive head and neck and cervical cancers, have distinct
mutational signatures potentially caused by members of the APOBEC3 cytidine
deaminase family. However, the mechanism that induces APOBEC3 activity in cancer 
cells is poorly understood. Here, we report that the HPV oncoprotein E7
stabilizes the APOBEC3A (A3A) protein in human keratinocytes by inhibiting
ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in a cullin-dependent manner.
Interestingly, the HPV E7-stabilized A3A protein maintains its deaminase
activity. These findings provide a new insight into cancer mutagenesis enhanced
by virus-induced A3A protein stabilization.
