BACKGROUND: The oral cavity and pharyngolarynx is readily open to the
environment, which provides a good atmosphere to viral infection and subsequently
links to the local carcinogenesis. The aim of this study is to clarify the viral 
risk factors for tongue and pharyngolaryngeal squamous carcinomas and the
oncogenic role of DNA viruses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas, and
corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM) were collected and subjected to
microdissection and DNA extraction with integrity detected by beta-globin
polymerase chain reaction(PCR). Additionally, we examined genomic DNA copies of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18, and John
Cunningham virus (JCV) by real-time PCR with a comparison of the
clinicopathological features of the tumors.
RESULTS: All the extracted DNA samples showed good integrity. Compared with NNM, 
EBV and HPV16 copies were higher in the three kinds of head and neck carcinoma
respectively (p<0.05). The same situation was also observed in tongue and
pharyngeal carcinoma for HPV18, and pharyngeal carcinoma for JCV (p<0.05). There 
were fewer EBV copies in tongue than pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma (p<0.05).
Pharyngeal carcinoma had a higher HPV16 copy number than tongue and laryngeal
carcinoma (p<0.05). Moderately differentiated carcinoma of the head and neck had 
more EBV copies than well-differentiated (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The viruses studied here might play an important role in the
carcinogenesis of tongue and pharyngolaryngeal squamous carcinomas.
