We describe the first case of an lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LEC) of the
mandible with a view to discuss probable histogenesis from salivary gland
inclusions in the mandible, effective therapy, the unusual pattern of nodal
metastases, and association with the Epstein-Barr virus. An 11-year-old boy
presented with a lytic lesion in the left mandible and bilateral neck node
enlargement. Histologically, the biopsied metastatic neck nodes showed sinusoids 
distended with histiocytes and single large atypical cells that mimicked Hodgkin 
lymphoma. The mandibular tumor on biopsy showed morphology similar to an
undifferentiated carcinoma or LEC of nasopharynx with nuclear Epstein-Barr
virus-associated in situ hybridization signals. The patient received ifosfamide, 
cisplatin, and etoposide chemotherapy followed by a hemimandibulectomy, which did
not reveal any residual tumor. Postoperative radiotherapy was completed, and 3
years later the patient is alive and free of disease.
