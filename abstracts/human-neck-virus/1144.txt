Since more than 5 years, it becomes evident that there is a new group of patients
with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck area, namely human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related (caused) tumors. As clinical statistics indicate,
those patients have better prognosis, even despite more advanced stage compared
to those with HPV-negative tumors. In fact, as a surrogate of HPV infection for
clinical studies, an immunohistochemical expression of p16 protein is used. In
the following chapter, the spectrum of squamous cell carcinomas variants with
indication of the percentage cases with proved HPV infection will be presented.
