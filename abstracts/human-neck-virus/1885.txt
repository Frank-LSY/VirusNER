BACKGROUND: The average prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in renal 
transplant recipients is 10%. Studies of these patients with HCV infection
usually focuses on long-term graft survival and patient survival. Studies of the 
correlation between HCV infection and bone mineral density (BMD) in renal
transplant patients are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
HCV infection is a risk factor for BMD change during a short follow-up period.
METHODS: Seventy-six renal transplant recipients underwent 2 separate dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans during a mean period of 14 months. Fifteen
patients were HCV infection. First bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar
spine, hip, and femoral neck was determined using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) between September 2008 and March 2009. After that, 34
patients took alendronate sodium 70 mg per week. Subgroups risk factors analysis 
was also performed into with or without alendronate. Immunosuppressive agents,
bisphosphonates, patient characteristics, and biochemical factors were analyzed
to identify associations with BMD.
RESULTS: After 14 months, in 76 patients, BMD of the lumbar spine had
significantly increased (from 0.9 g/cm² to 0.92 g/cm², p<0.001), whereas BMD of
the hip and femoral neck had not. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that
HCV infection was negatively associated with BMD change in the lumbar spine ( β: 
-0.247, 95% CI, -0.035 to -0.002; p = 0.028). Moreover, in subgroup analysis,
among 42 patients without alendronate, multiple linear regression analysis showed
HCV infection was a risk factor for adverse BMD change of the lumbar spine ( β:
-0.371, 95% CI, -0.043 to -0.003; p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: HCV infection in renal transplant recipients was a negative risk
factor for BMD change in the lumbar spine. Moreover, alendronate may be able to
reverse the negative effect of HCV infection on bone in renal transplant
recipients.
