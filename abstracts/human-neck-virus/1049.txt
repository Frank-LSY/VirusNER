Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for a rising proportion of
oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers (OSCCs). HPV-positive OSCCs (HPV-OSCCs) are
associated with oral HPV infection and sexual behavior. Patient questions
regarding risk factors, prognosis and implications for past, present and future
relationships often arise. This manuscript addresses frequently asked questions
by patients with HPV-OSCC and their families. A framework for clinicians to
address these conversations and the limitations of our present knowledge base is 
also presented.
