Streptococcus pneumoniae usually produces infection of the respiratory tract,
inner ear or meninges. Unusual sites of infection have rarely been reported among
HIV-1 seropositive patients. We report a case of post auricular subcutaneous
abscess caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) infected child who also had B cell lymphoma. This case is uncommon as there
was no other documented primary focus of pneumococcal infection or a preceding
history of bacteraemia or respiratory infection.
