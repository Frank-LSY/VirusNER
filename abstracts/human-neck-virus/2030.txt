The ICI 2013 Mucosal Vaccine Workshop presentations covered a wide range of
topics, these mainly fell into three categories: (i) Understanding the
interactions of host and microbes, specifically commensal pathogens and improving
the antigen uptake via the (microfold cells) M cells to induce effective IgA
antibody immunity at the gut mucosa; (ii) effective plant-based vaccines and
(iii) development of prophylactic and therapeutic mucosal-based vaccine
strategies for virus infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
influenza and human papillomavirus (HPV) associated head and neck cancers. How to
improve the efficacy of oral vaccines, novel intranasal mucosal adjuvants and a
unique intra-cheek delivery method were also discussed. Presenters emphasized the
differences associated with systemic and mucosal vaccination, specifically, how
mucosal vaccines unlike systemic delivery can induce effective immunity at the
first line of defence. Collectively, the workshop provided insights into recent
developments in the mucosal vaccine research field, highlighting the complexities
associated with designing safe and effective mucosal vaccines.
