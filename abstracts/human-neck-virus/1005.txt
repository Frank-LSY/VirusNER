INTRODUCTION: Previous studies indicate that human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-infection and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can affect bone
turnover. Furthermore, HIV-infected patients have lower bone mineral density
(BMD) compared to a healthy reference population.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the longitudinal effect of HIV-infection and cART on bone 
turnover markers (BTMs) and BMD in men with primary HIV-infection (PHI).
DESIGN, METHODS: Thirty-five PHI-men were divided into two groups, those that
received cART for the first time (n = 26) versus no-cART (n = 9). Dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed on femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH) and
lumbar spine (LS) and BTMs (P1NP, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, ICTP and
CTX) were measured at baseline and follow-up.
RESULTS: At baseline, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 455 cells/mm3 (IQR
320-620) and plasma viral load 5.4 log10 copies/mL (IQR 4.7-6.0) in the cART
treated group, compared to 630 (IQR 590-910) and 4.8 (IQR 4.2-5.1) in the
untreated group. The median follow-up time was 60.7 weeks (IQR 24.7-96.0). All
BTMs, except ICTP, showed a significant increase during cART versus no changes of
BTMs in the untreated group. FN and TH BMD showed a significant decrease in both 
groups. LS BMD did not change in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Bone turnover increased in PHI-men treated with cART which was
accompanied by a decrease in FN and TH BMD. No increase of bone turnover was seen
in untreated PHI-men. Our study suggests that cART results in increased bone
turnover and decreased BMD of the hip in PHI-men.
