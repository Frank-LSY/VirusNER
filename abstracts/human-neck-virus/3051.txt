The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) catalyse one of
the most unusual membrane remodelling events in cell biology. ESCRT-I and
ESCRT-II direct membrane budding away from the cytosol by stabilizing bud necks
without coating the buds and without being consumed in the buds. ESCRT-III
cleaves the bud necks from their cytosolic faces. ESCRT-III-mediated membrane
neck cleavage is crucial for many processes, including the biogenesis of
multivesicular bodies, viral budding, cytokinesis and, probably, autophagy.
Recent studies of ultrastructures induced by ESCRT-III overexpression in cells
and the in vitro reconstitution of the budding and scission reactions have led to
breakthroughs in understanding these remarkable membrane reactions.
