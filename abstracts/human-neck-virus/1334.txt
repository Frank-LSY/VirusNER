The molecular mechanism of p16-mediated senescence in cisplatin-treated cancer
cells is not fully understood. Here we show that cisplatin treatment of head and 
neck cancer cells results in nuclear transport of p16 leading to a molecular
modification of NFκB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that this
modification is associated with the inhibition of NFκB interacting with its DNA
binding sequences, leading to decreased expression of NFκB-transcribed proteins. 
LCMS proteomic analysis of LAP-TAP-purified proteins from HeLa cells containing a
tetracycline-inducible GFP-S peptide-NFκB expression system identified gigaxonin,
an ubiquitin E3 ligase adaptor, as an NFκB-interacting protein. Immunoblotting
and siRNA studies confirmed the NFκB-gigaxonin interaction and the dependence of 
this binding on p16-NFκB binding. Using gel shift assays, we have confirmed
p16-NFκB and gigaxonin-NFκB interactions. Furthermore, we have observed increased
NFκB ubiquitination with cisplatin treatment that is abolished in the absence of 
p16 and gigaxonin expression. Analysis of 103 primary tumors has shown that
increased nuclear p16 expression correlates with enhanced survival of head and
neck cancer patients (p < 0.0000542), indicating the importance of nuclear p16
expression in prognosis. Finally, p16 expression is associated with reduced
cytokine expression and the presence of human papilloma virus in
chemoradiation-sensitive basaloid tumors. However, the absence of p16 expression 
is associated with enhanced cytokine expression and the absence of human
papilloma virus in aggressive tumors. These results clearly demonstrate that
nuclear p16 and gigaxonin play an important role in chemosensitivity of head and 
neck cancers through ubiquitination of NFκB.
