Mumps virus infection primarily affects the salivary glands and may incur various
complications. Laryngeal edema is such a rare complication that few adult cases
have been reported. We report the first known pediatric patient with mumps with
laryngeal edema. An 8-year-old boy developed dyspnea after a rapidly progressive 
swelling of his face and neck. Laryngoscopy revealed edematous changes in the
supraglottic and subglottic regions, and computed tomography confirmed
significant laryngeal edema in addition to swelling of the cervical soft tissue
and the salivary glands. Laboratory findings revealed a high serum amylase level 
and confirmed the diagnosis of mumps. Intravenous steroid administration
alleviated the dyspnea, although the patient required temporary tracheal
intubation to maintain airway patency. He did not need tracheotomy and did not
experience any other complications. Laryngeal edema must be regarded as a rare,
potentially life-threatening complication of mumps. When mumps is diagnosed with 
significant swelling of the neck, an emergency airway should be established to
prevent airway obstruction.
