Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that arises as a result of the
activity of human papillomavirus (HPV) malignant transformation has a distinct
disease pattern that is the basis for its clinical presentation. A clear
understanding of these distinct clinical features enables diagnosticians to
maintain awareness and index of suspicion to avoid delays in detection and select
the most effective and thorough measures of evaluating the disease and directing 
treatment selection. Attention is focused on the broader demographic at risk for 
developing HPV-related HNSCC, the phenomenon of cystic cervical nodal metastases,
and the unknown or occult primary cancer.
