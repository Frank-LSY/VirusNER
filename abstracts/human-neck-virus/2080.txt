BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established prognostic marker
for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC). Because of the limited numbers of
women and nonwhites in studies to date, sex and racial/ethnic differences in
prognosis have not been well explored. In this study, survival differences were
explored by the tumor HPV status among 1) patients with OPSCCs by sex and race
and 2) patients with nonoropharyngeal (non-OP) head and neck squamous cell
cancers (HNSCCs).
METHODS: This retrospective, multi-institution study included OPSCCs and non-OP
HNSCCs of the oral cavity, larynx, and nasopharynx diagnosed from 1995 to 2012.
Race/ethnicity was categorized as white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Asian
non-Hispanic, and Hispanic of any race. Tumors were centrally tested for p16
overexpression and the presence of HPV by HPV16 DNA and high-risk HPV E6/E7
messenger RNA in situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards
models were used to evaluate overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The study population included 239 patients with OPSCC and 621 patients
with non-OP HNSCC with a median follow-up time of 3.5 years. After adjustments
for the tumor HPV status, age, current tobacco use, and stage, the risk of death 
was lower for women versus men with OPSCC (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.55; P = .04).
The results were similar with p16. In contrast, for non-OP HNSCCs, HPV
positivity, p16 positivity, and sex were not associated with OS.
CONCLUSIONS: For OPSCC, there are differences in survival by sex, even after the 
tumor HPV status has been taken into account. For non-OP HNSCC, the HPV status
and the p16 status are not of prognostic significance. Cancer 2017;123:1566-1575.
