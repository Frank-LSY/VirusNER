Eczema herpeticum (EH), first described in 1887, is characterized by a
disseminated skin infection consisting of dome-shaped papules and is associated
with fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. The condition commonly occurs on the
trunk, head, and neck and is associated with numerous skin conditions, including 
atopic dermatitis. It is a result of a superimposed herpes simplex virus
infection on otherwise compromised skin. It is a rapidly spreading infection, and
early antiviral treatment is essential. Herpes gladiatorum is a common infection 
in the wrestling population, and atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition in 
the general population. Together, these 2 conditions can greatly increase the
risk of EH infection. It is important for both sports medicine physicians and
dermatologists to be aware of the risk of EH infection in this population, the
presenting signs and symptoms, and be ready to respond quickly with antiviral
treatment.
