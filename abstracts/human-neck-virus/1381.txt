OBJECTIVE: To determine whether machine learning can accurately classify human
papillomavirus (HPV) status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)
using computed tomography (CT)-based texture analysis.
METHODS: Texture analyses were retrospectively applied to regions of interest
from OPSCC primary tumors on contrast-enhanced neck CT, and machine learning was 
used to create a model that classified HPV status with the highest accuracy.
Results were compared against the blinded review of 2 neuroradiologists.
RESULTS: The HPV-positive (n = 92) and -negative (n = 15) cohorts were well
matched clinically. Neuroradiologist classification accuracies for HPV status
(44.9%, 55.1%) were not significantly different (P = 0.13), and there was a lack 
of agreement between the 2 neuroradiologists (Îº = -0.145). The best machine
learning model had an accuracy of 75.7%, which was greater than either
neuroradiologist (P < 0.001, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Useful diagnostic information regarding HPV infection can be
extracted from the CT appearance of OPSCC beyond what is apparent to the trained 
human eye.
