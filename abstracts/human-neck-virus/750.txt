OBJECTIVES: There exists a significant gap in vaccine coverage of the human
papillomavirus (HPV) among college-aged students. This study assessed sexual
risk-taking behavior among university students and analyzed predictors of HPV
vaccine initiation and completion in this population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data (n = 746) were from an anonymous online,
cross-sectional survey distributed to university students, between the ages of
19-26 years, at a private Midwestern university. Both chi-square and
multivariable logistics regression models estimated the association between
sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk factors (including number of
vaginal sexual partners, number of oral sexual partners, initiation of oral sex, 
and initiation of vaginal sex), with HPV vaccine initiation and completion.
RESULTS: A significant number of participants (40%) had not received a single
dose of the HPV vaccine series. Of those who initiated the series, more than half
(51%) did not achieve completion. Additionally, a greater number of participants 
have had multiple (4 or more) oral sexual partners than vaginal sexual partners
(25.7% vs. 20.3%). After adjusting for covariates, it was found that sexual risk 
factors were not significantly associated with HPV vaccine initiation or
completion.
CONCLUSION: HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates are suboptimal among
university students. High levels of sexual-risk taking behaviors associated with 
HPV infection persist, yet are not significant predictors of HPV vaccine
behaviors in this age group. To increase uptake among 18-26-year-old students,
future public health interventions should focus on HPV vaccine education and
uptake across the entire population, irrespective of sexual risk profile.
