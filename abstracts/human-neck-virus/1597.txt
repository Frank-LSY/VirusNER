BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status on
speech, swallowing, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes after surgical treatment
of oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC).
METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of all
patients with OPSCC diagnosed and treated from 1998 to 2009. Speech, swallowing, 
and quality of life data were gathered at 3 different evaluation points. HPV
status was determined using p16 positivity as a surrogate marker. Univariate and 
multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify whether p16 status
is a significant predictor of functional outcome and QOL.
RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients with OPSCC and known p16 status were treated
with primary surgery between 1998 and 2009, with mean age of 56 years. Out of
those patients 63 (56%) were p16 positive. Speech intelligibility remained high
at 1-year post operation (95.4%). Only 11.5% of the patients required a feeding
tube at 1 year after surgery to maintain their daily caloric requirements and the
risk of aspiration after surgery was not significant (p = 0.097). There was no
statistically or clinically significant difference in speech, swallowing ability,
swallowing safety and QOL outcomes between p16-positive and negative OPSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgically treated OPSCC patients demonstrate excellent swallowing
function and can achieve excellent speech perception. P16 status may not be
predictive of functional outcomes or QOL in surgically treated OPSCC.
