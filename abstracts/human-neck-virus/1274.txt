BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) is associated with favorable survival. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic significance of the HPV infection
through both the p16 expression status and the oncogenic HPV DNA viral load.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients treated for
oropharyngeal SCC between January 2007 and June 2009. P16 expression status by
immunohistochemistry and HPV DNA viral load by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) were evaluated on routine pretreatment tumor samples.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients (94 men and 39 women) were included in
the study. Mean age was 59 years. One hundred twenty-two lesions (92%) were
localized to lymphoid areas. Sixty-seven patients (50%) were p16+, and 87
patients (65%) harbored HPV DNA. The p16+/HPV DNA+ profile (48%) was associated
with the most favorable prognosis. HPV16 was responsible for the majority of the 
infections (89%).
CONCLUSION: HPV is common among oropharyngeal SCC in France, and acts as an
independent prognostic factor.
