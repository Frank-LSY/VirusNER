OBJECTIVE: This paper reports a rare case of a human immunodeficiency virus
infected man with gummatous syphilis of the face.
CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old man presented with an ulcer of the face which had been
slowly progressive over the previous 6 years. Examination showed an ulcerative
lesion of the midface involving the cheeks, and completely destroying the nose,
the upper lip and part of the lower lip. The teeth and gums were exposed. The
ulcer had a moist, purulent base with rolled edges. The patient had human
immunodeficiency virus, with a cluster of differentiation 4 count of 641 cells
per Âµl. The rapid plasma reagin test titre was 1:1024 and the Treponema pallidum 
haemagglutination assay result was positive. Biopsy showed non-necrotising
granulomata with a negative Warthin-Starry silver stain. There was a dramatic
response to treatment with penicillin.
CONCLUSION: This case study is a reminder that syphilis needs to be considered in
the differential diagnosis of unusual presentations involving skin and bone.
