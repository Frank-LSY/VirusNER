OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and persistence of human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection in the oral mucosa of patients with head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), and its correlation with prognosis.
STUDY DESIGN: HPV infection was characterized in tumors and pre and posttreatment
oral scrapings in 51 patients with HNSCC and matched controls using the SPF10
LiPA Extra assay. p16INK4A immunostain and in situ hybridization for high-risk
HPV genotypes recognized transcriptionally active infection in tumor samples. The
risk of infection was compared in patients and controls. The association of
pretreatment HPV status with recurrence and survival and with posttreatment HPV
persistence was assessed.
RESULTS: Oral HPV infection risk was significantly higher in patients with HNSCC 
than in controls (P < .001). Oral HPV infection was associated with infection in 
the first posttreatment scrapings (P = .015), but did not affect recurrence or
prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Oral HPV infection is frequent in patients with HNSCC and has no
prognostic implications, suggesting that posttreatment polymerase chain reaction 
monitoring on oral cells is not effective to monitor patient recurrence risk.
