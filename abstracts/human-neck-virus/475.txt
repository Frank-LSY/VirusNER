Mycoplasma hominis most frequently causes diseases of the genitourinary tract.
Extragenital infections are uncommon, with almost all occurring in
immunosuppressed persons or those predisposed due to trauma or surgery. We
present the case of a previously well man who developed an M. hominis-associated 
parapharyngeal abscess following acute Epstein-Barr virus infection.
