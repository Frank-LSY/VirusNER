OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptom duration and purulent
rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.
REVIEW METHODS: We performed a comprehensive systematic search on March 28, 2013.
We included studies on the diagnostic value of duration of symptoms and purulent 
rhinorrhea in patients suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We
assessed study design of included articles for directness of evidence and risk of
bias. We extracted prevalence and positive and negative predictive values.
RESULTS: Of 4173 unique publications, we included 1 study with high directness of
evidence and moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial
rhinosinusitis was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.35); we could not
extract posterior probabilities. Odds ratios (95% CI) from univariate analysis
were 1.03 (0.78-1.36) for duration of symptoms and 2.69 (1.39-5.18) for colored
discharge on the floor of the nasal cavity.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: We included 1 study with moderate risk of bias,
reporting data in such a manner that we could not assess the value of symptom
duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial
rhinosinusitis. Recommendations to distinguish between a viral and a bacterial
source based on purulent rhinorrhea are not supported by evidence, and the
decision to prescribe antibiotic treatment should not depend on its presence.
Based on judgment driven by theory and subsidiary evidence of a greater
likelihood of bacterial rhinosinusitis after 10 days, antibiotic therapy may seem
a reasonable empirical option.
