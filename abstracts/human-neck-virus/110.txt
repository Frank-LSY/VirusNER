BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common illness, yet little is known
about its pathogenesis, including the role played by respiratory viruses.
METHODS: A transversal prospective study was conducted to analyze the seasonality
of CRS using real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect respiratory virus
genomes in secretions and tissue samples from patients with CRS with and without 
nasal polyps.
RESULTS: The frequency of viral detection was 41% (31/75). The respiratory virus 
most frequently detected was human rhinovirus, found in 18 patients (24%),
followed by human metapneumovirus, human enterovirus, human respiratory sincicial
virus, human adenovirus, human bocavirus, human coronavirus, and human influenza 
virus, detected in 12 (16%), five (6.6%), four (5.3%), four (5.3%), two (2.6%),
two (2.6%), and one (1.3%) patient(s), respectively. Although none of the
patients presented symptoms when the samples were collected, there was a peak in 
detection of the most prevalent virus in the autumn and winter seasons of both
years, similar to the pattern that occurs in acute conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of respiratory virus seasonality found in nasal mucosa, 
polyps, and paranasal sinus samples in patients with CRS reinforces the
possibility of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections.
