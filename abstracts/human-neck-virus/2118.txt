OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association of HPV16
antibodies (Abs) and oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) risk in sera obtained prior to
clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: We identified 92 participants with incident OPC and 460 matched controls
from the Janus Serum Bank Cohort in Norway. Archived tumor specimens were
requested for a subset of the cases. Serum samples were collected from cases, on 
average, 9.3years before diagnosis (range, 0.1-14.9years). Ten cases had serum
samples from multiple time points. IgG seropositivity to 8 HPV16 antigens was
determined, and a logistic regression classifier of a panel of all early-antigen 
(EA) Abs for the predictive diagnosis of OPC was applied.
RESULTS: HPV16 EA seropositivity was present in 25.0% of patients with OPC and
7.6% of controls (odds ratio (OR), 4.1; 95% CI, 2.3-7.2, p<0.0001). Abs to E2
were strongly associated with cases 0-2years pre- diagnosis (OR, 150.1; 95% CI,
27.4-1040.0, p<0.0001), and the probability of seropositivity was inversely
associated with time to diagnosis (OR, 0.7 per additional year; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9, 
p=0.0002). Abs to E2 were also strongly associated with tumor HPV status (OR,
35.6; 95% CI, 8.7-200.0, p<0.0001). A positive score on the binary classifier was
associated with an overall OR of 15.8 (95% CI, 5.6-53.4) compared with controls
(p<0.05), and was strongly associated with tumor HPV status (OR, 27.4; 95% CI,
8.6-99.6, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV16 Abs are detectable years prior to diagnosis of OPC, and the
probability of seropositivity increases closer to diagnosis.
