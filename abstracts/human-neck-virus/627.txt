Castleman's disease (CD) is an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder
characterized by hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue that may develop at a single site
or throughout the body. This disorder has frequently been associated with several
systemic syndromes, including human immunodeficiency virus infection,
polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin
changes (POEMS) syndrome and various connective tissue diseases. However, there
have been no previously reported cases of concomitant sarcoidosis and CD. In this
report, the authors describe a young woman with an enlarging neck mass, biopsy of
which showed histopathological features consistent with the hyaline vascular type
of CD along with the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas and was deemed
unresectable due to encasement of vital neural and vascular structures. Further
studies revealed hypermetabolic generalized lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
perilymphatic nodules. Bronchoscopic investigations demonstrated the presence of 
non-necrotizing granulomas within the lung parenchyma and mediastinal lymph
nodes, a CD4(+) T-lymphocyte predominant bronchoalveolar lavage and an elevated
CD4/CD8 ratio consistent with a concomitant diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Institution
of immunosuppression with prednisone and methotrexate led to reduction in size of
the neck mass that allowed radical curative resection of the CD.
