BACKGROUND: Most tumours of the head and neck are attributable to smoking and
alcohol use, but an increasing proportion of head and neck tumours are caused by 
human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The aim of this study was to use in house
molecular assays to detect and genotype HPV in biopsies from patients with
histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, the
results were compared with p16 immunohistochemistry staining, which has been
described as a potential marker for HPV infection.
METHODS: Biopsies of squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, nasopharynx,
larynx and hypopharynx from 112 South African patients were screened using three 
PCR assays targeting the L1 and E6 regions of HPV and p16 immunohistochemical
staining.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: HPV was identified in 7 (6.3%) tumours, while 22 (19.6%) 
had positive p16 immunohistochemical staining. There was concordance between the 
results obtained using the three PCR assays. There was substantial agreement
between the results of molecular tests and p16 immunohistochemistry for
hypopharyngeal carcinomas, but only fair agreement for laryngeal and
oropharyngeal carcinomas.
