We describe the epidemiological and clinical findings of 13 patients with
diagnosis of infection by St. Louis encephalitis virus, transmitted between
January and March 2010 in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA). Thirteen
patients, average age 38 years, had an acute onset with hyperthermia and
headache. Between days two and ten of the onset of symptoms, 7/13 patients had
signs and symptoms of neurological involvement. This was characterized by
meningitis without encephalic sings in 1/7 and in 6/7 the most frequent findings 
were: stiff neck, disorientation, photophobia, confusion and language impairment.
Two MR and one EEG revealed signs of involvement of temporal lobes. The
cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis with predominance of mononuclear cells,
normal glucose and moderately elevated protein. There were no fatalities cases.
In 6/13 patients the initial clinical suspicion was dengue. As epidemic virus
circulation had not been previously reported in the AMBA it can be considered an 
outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis for the spatial and temporal clustering of
cases.
