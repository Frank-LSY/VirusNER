Tuberculosis (TB) of the maxillary sinus is rare. We describe the clinical
presentation, management and outcome in two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
seronegative patients with histopathologically confirmed maxillary sinus TB. One 
of the patients who presented earlier in the course of the disease could be
managed with antituberculosis treatment alone, while the other who presented late
required surgical intervention as well.
