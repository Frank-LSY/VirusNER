PURPOSE: The aim is to study the clinicodemographic profile and treatment outcome
of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN).
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of 57 eyes (56 cases) with 
clinically diagnosed OSSN, presenting in our center over the past year.
RESULTS: The median age of presentation was 55 years with male:female ratio being
4.5:1. Systemic predisposing conditions were xeroderma pigmentosa (1) postkidney 
transplant immunosuppression (1), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (1).
Patients with predisposing conditions had a younger median age of onset (33
years). The majority of tumors were nodular (61.4%), gelatinous (61.4%), and had 
limbal involvement (96%). On ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), mean tumor height
was 2.93 ± 1.02 mm, and intraocular extension was evident in seven eyes. OSSN
with intraocular extension had a mean tumor height of 4.3 ± 1.32 mm. Nodal
metastasis was seen in one case at presentation. As per American Joint Committee 
for Cancer Classification seventh edition staging-two cases were T1, one was T2, 
46 were T3 and eight were T4. Treatment advised included conservative therapy for
39; wide local excision (4 mm margin clearance) with cryotherapy for seven;
enucleation in four; and exenteration in four eyes. Overall, complete regression 
was achieved in 88% of cases during a mean follow-up of 13.5 ± 4.6 months.
Recurrence was seen in three cases, which were treated with exenteration, radical
neck dissection, and palliative chemo-radiotherapy, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although associated with old age, earlier onset of OSSN is seen in
patients with systemic predisposing conditions. Thicker tumors in the setting of 
a previous surgery or immunocompromised status should be considered high-risk
features for intraocular extension and should be evaluated on UBM.
