OBJECTIVES: We previously reported the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel added to
cisplatin, 5-FU, and cetuximab (APF-C) followed by concurrent high dose bolus
cisplatin and radiation therapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this phase II trial, we determined the
efficacy of APF (without cetuximab) followed by CRT in similar patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had stage III-IV oropharynx (OP),
larynx, or hypopharynx SCC and adequate organ function and performance status. T1
tumors were excluded. Patients were treated with three cycles of APF followed by 
CRT. Efficacy endpoints included two-year disease-specific survival (DSS),
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and relapse rate.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. Most patients were smokers (77%) with
bulky T3/4 (73%) and N2/3 (83%) tumors. Analyses were stratified for human
papilloma virus (HPV) status: HPV-related OPSCC (n=17; 57%) and HPV-unrelated
HNSCC (n=13; 43%). With a minimum follow-up of 21months, relapse occurred in 1
(3%) patient. Two-year DSS was 94% in HPV-related OPSCC and 100% in HPV-unrelated
HNSCC. Two-year PFS was 94% in HPV-related OPSCC and 100% in HPV-unrelated HNSCC.
Two-year OS was 94% in HPV-related OPSCC and 92% in HPV-unrelated HNSCC. Causes
of death were relapse (1), treatment-related mortality (1), and co-morbidity (1).
Two patients with HPV-unrelated HNSCC treated with APF declined CRT and remained 
free of relapse at 36 and 28months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This phase II trial demonstrated favorable two-year DSS, PFS, and OS 
and a low relapse rate in HPV-unrelated HNSCC and HPV-related OPSCC treated with 
APF followed by CRT.
