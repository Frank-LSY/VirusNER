OBJECTIVES: To describe patient-reported quality of life (QoL) for patients with 
HPV/p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing
post-chemoradiation (CRT) superselective or selective neck dissection (ND) as
part of a prospective de-intensification study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received 60Gy IMRT with concurrent weekly
cisplatin (30mg/m(2)), followed by preplanned neck dissection of only originally 
involved nodal levels. QoL measures were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30
(general), EORTC H&N-35 (head and neck specific), EAT-10 (swallowing), and NDII
(Neck Dissection Impairment Index) questionnaires. Early and late post-ND time
points were compared to baseline and post-CRT/pre-ND time points.
RESULTS: 37 patients underwent post-CRT superselective or selective ND. Median # 
of levels and nodes dissected were 2 and 12, respectively. EORTC QLQ-C30, H&N-35,
and EAT-10 QoL scores worsened after CRT but continued to improve thereafter
despite post-CRT ND. NDII score worsened initially after ND at the early post-ND 
time point (p=0.023) but had recovered by the late post-ND time point (p=0.672). 
Initial decrease in NDII was greater with ⩾12 nodes dissected (p=0.007) and was
correlated with the total number of nodes dissected (Spearman p=0.027).
CONCLUSION: Use of post-CRT superselective and selective ND did not prevent
recovery of most QoL metrics to near baseline. There was early but not late
decrement in neck dissection specific QoL (NDII), more pronounced with more nodes
dissected.
