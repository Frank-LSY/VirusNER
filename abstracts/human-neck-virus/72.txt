Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world with 600,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Tobacco and alcohol use have been associated as the principal etiological factors of this pathogenesis. The incidence of smoking-associated HNSCC has declined, while human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated HNSCC is on the rise. There are currently no clinically validated biomarkers to detect this cancer at an early stage (cancers independent of HPV status). It is well-established that the aberrant expression of miRNAs can lead to tumorigenesis. miRNA expression differences have also been demonstrated in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC tumor tissues as well as in body fluids. Therefore, miRNAs have the potential to provide an unprecedented insight into the pathogenesis of HNSCC and serve as potential biomarkers. This review addresses HNSCC disease burden and the regulation of miRNA by HPV viral oncoproteins, potential miRNA biomarkers and future perspectives. miRNA provides an unique opportunity to fulfill the current clinical challenge in HNSCC patient management by enabling early detection followed by targeted interventions, leading to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity.
