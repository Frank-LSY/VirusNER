OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the prevalence of high-risk HPV16 using
saliva in a screening population in Detroit, Michigan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was
applied to detect HPV16 in saliva DNA from 349 screening subjects without head
and neck cancer (HNC), 156 with HNC, and 19 controls. Cut points for human
papilloma virus (HPV) positivity were >0 and >0.001 copy/cell. Proportions were
compared between groups using exact Ï‡(2) or Fisher exact tests (P < .05).
RESULTS: At a cut point >0, each group had an overall HPV prevalence of more than
5%, with a higher prevalence of 30.8% in the HNC patient group. At a cut point
>0.001, the prevalence was lower: 0% in the control, 1.2% in the screening, and
16.7% in the HNC group. In the latter, for both cut points, HPV prevalence was
different across sites (<0.001) and significantly higher in the oropharynx than
larynx or site as other after Hochberg's adjustment. At >0, women in the
screening group had a higher prevalence of HPV than did men (P = .010), and at
>0.001, the prevalence was higher for men in the HNC group than for women (P =
.035). In the screening group, at >0, only African Americans had a higher
prevalence than Caucasian Americans (P = .025).
CONCLUSIONS: In the screening group, a 6.9% and 1.2% screening rate was noted at 
cut points >0 and >0.001, respectively. The results provide data to inform public
health considerations of the feasibility of saliva as a screening tool in at-risk
populations with the long-term goal of prophylactic vaccination against oral HPV.
