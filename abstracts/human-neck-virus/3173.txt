BACKGROUND: Viral sinusitis can precede acute bacterial sinusitis, but the
influence of viral infection on bacterial colonization is unclear. The objective 
of this study was to evaluate the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the osteomeatal complex
(OMC), nasal cavity, and nasopharynx in adults during wellness and viral upper
respiratory illness (URI).
METHODS: Subjects were recruited for the study during wellness and at the time of
acute viral rhinosinusitis. Swab cultures were obtained from the OMC, nasal
cavity, and the nasopharynx. Swab eluates were inoculated on selective agars to
detect S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.
RESULTS: The study included 237 subjects, 100 adults with URI and 137 well
adults. Positive culture results were found for any site in 70% (n = 70) of ill
subjects and 64% (n = 88) of well subjects (p = 0.393). Of the 91 OMC cultures,
positive cultures were over five times more likely to be found in ill subjects
than in well subjects (31% versus 8%; p = 0.010). The nasal cavity cultures were 
positively statistically significant more often in ill subjects versus well
subjects (39% versus 25%; p = 0.022). The overall nasopharyngeal cultures did not
show a statistically significant difference (65% versus 60%; odds ratio, 1.2; p =
0.461). S. pneumoniae was positively cultured in at least one site in 15% of ill 
subjects and 31% of well subjects (p = 0.006). H. influenzae was positively
cultured in at least one site in 45% of ill subjects and 31% of well subjects (p 
= 0.027). M. catarrhalis was positively cultured in at least one site in 42% of
ill subjects and 27% of well subjects (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: This study defines the carriage rates of the three most common
bacterial pathogens for acute sinusitis in the nasopharynx, nasal cavity, and OMC
during illness and in the healthy state.
