There are recent advances, namely, a standardized method for reporting therapy
response (Hopkins criteria), a multicenter prospective cohort study with
excellent negative predictive value of F-FDG PET/CT for N0 clinical neck, a phase
III multicenter randomized controlled study establishing the value of a negative 
posttherapy F-FDG PET/CT for patient management, a phase II randomized controlled
study demonstrating radiation dose reduction strategies for human papilloma
virus-related disease, and Food and Drug Administration approval of nivolumab for
treatment of recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
