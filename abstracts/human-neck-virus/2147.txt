BACKGROUND: Current standard of care for oropharyngeal cancers with positive
surgical margins and/or extracapsular extension is adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. It
is unknown whether HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer benefits from this treatment
intensification.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcomes of HPV+ patients treated with adjuvant
radiotherapy alone when chemoradiotherapy was indicated based on high risk
pathological features. They were compared with high risk HPV+ patients treated
with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: All high risk HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer patients (9) who received
radiotherapy alone were identified. We also identified 17 patients who received
chemoradiotherapy as a comparison group. Median follow up time was 37.3 months.
RESULTS: No local failures developed in adjuvant radiotherapy group. There was 1 
distant recurrence in this cohort and 3 in CRT cohort. Regarding toxicity, 8
(47.1%) chemoradiotherapy patients had >10 lb. weight loss (p = 0.013), despite
75% of them having a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed. No
individuals in radiotherapy group experienced a >10 lb. weight loss and none
required a gastrostomy tube.
CONCLUSIONS: This series provides preliminary evidence suggesting that the
omission of concurrent chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy may offer
comparative local control rates with a lower toxicity profile in the setting of
HPV+ patients with traditional high risk features.
