In recent years, changes in epidemiology-based prognostic factors such as human papilloma virus (HPV) cancers, advances in imaging and minimally invasive surgery have been integrated in the management of cervical lymphadenopathies of unknown primary. In particular, systematic use of PET scanner and increasing practice of robotic or laser surgery have contributed to increasing detection rate of primary cancers. These allow more adapted and personalized treatments. The impact of changes in the eighth TNM staging system is discussed.
