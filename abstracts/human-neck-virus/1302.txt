BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible
epidemiological association between oropharyngeal carcinoma and anogenital
tumors.
METHODS: Population-based demographic and pathologic data on all male patients
diagnosed with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and anogenital
cancer between 1980 and 2011 in the province of Alberta was collected. The risk
of association between anogenital cancers and OPSCCs was estimated.
RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2011, a total of 2105 male patients were diagnosed with
OPSCC and 914 with anogenital cancers. Only 5 patients were diagnosed with both.
CONCLUSION: In our male population, there was no significant association between 
anogenital and OPSCCs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E2100-E2102,
