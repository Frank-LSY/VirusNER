AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) in the oral cavity has been retrospectively
associated with an increased risk of developing HPV-positive head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this study was to determine the
prevalence of oral HPV infection in a local population of New Zealand women aged 
18 to 25 years, including determination of HPV genotypes, and to assess potential
risk factors for oral HPV infection using participant questionnaire responses.
METHODS: Oral brushings and questionnaire responses were collected from 234 women
recruited from sexual health and student health centres. Questions covered age,
ethnicity, sexual partners, alcohol consumption and smoking. PGMY primers were
used for HPV detection by PCR, and results confirmed by sequencing and the cobasÂ®
4800 HPV system.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HPV infection was 3.2% of 216 women (95% CI:
1.6%-6.5%). Samples from two women (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.3%-3.3%) contained oncogenic 
HPV, and another five (2.3%, 95% CI: 1.0%-5.3%) were positive for HPV 13. No
significant associations were found between putative risk factors and the
presence of oral HPV infection.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV in the oral cavity of New Zealand woman was
comparable to results of other studies, but showed an unusual distribution of HPV
types. The comparatively high detection rate of HPV 13 suggests that further work
into clinical significance of oral HPV 13 infection is warranted.
