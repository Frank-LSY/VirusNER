Viral respiratory infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children. The most common human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been detected in middle ear effusions (MEE), but there is only limited data available about the closely related human enteroviruses (HEVs). The newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV) has not, however, been identified in MEE of OME children.
