BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of high-risk
human papillomavirus (HPV) in lymph node metastasis and the depth of invasion in 
oropharyngeal cancer.
METHODS: The study included patients with 90 oral carcinomas and 66 oropharyngeal
carcinomas. High-risk HPV in situ hybridization was performed to detect HPV
infection.
RESULTS: The positive rate of high-risk HPV in situ hybridization was 15.4% (24
of 156). There was a significant difference in the fraction of positive high-risk
HPV between oral (6.7%) and oropharyngeal (27.3%) cancers (p < .000). Significant
correlations were found between positive high-risk HPV and cervical lymph node
metastasis, tumor depth of invasion in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (p =
.002, p = .016, respectively). There was a statistically significant association 
between high-risk HPV positivity and the disease-specific survival in patients
with oropharyngeal cancer (p = .035).
CONCLUSION: High-risk HPV infection was significantly related to cervical lymph
node metastasis and depth of invasion in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. ©
