Although relatively uncommon, oropharyngeal cancers are increasing in incidence
despite declining prevalence of smoking and in direct opposition to a decreasing 
incidence of all other head and neck cancers. An epidemic of human papillomavirus
(HPV)--associated oropharyngeal cancers seems to account for these incidence
trends. Important demographic, behavioral, and prognostic characteristics define 
this unique population. Changes in prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, staging,
and treatment are needed. This article summarizes the epidemiology and clinical
behavior of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer and discusses evolving/potential 
paradigms of treatment. However, data are currently insufficient to change
treatment paradigms for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer outside of a closely 
monitored clinical trial.
