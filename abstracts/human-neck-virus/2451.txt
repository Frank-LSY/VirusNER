Benign symmetric lipomatosis (BSL) is a rare condition characterized by
deposition of unencapsulated adipose tissue at typical sites on the body.
Although the pathogenesis is not clearly defined, the disease has been associated
with male gender, alcoholism, Mediterranean descent, and highly active
antiretroviral therapy. A case study is presented of a facelift performed on a
human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient on a highly active antiretroviral
therapy with facial lipoatrophy in the anterior cheek region in combination with 
BSL characterized by excess fat deposits in multiple areas including the
posterior cheeks and neck. The resultant peculiar deformity was managed in this
case with a modified facelift and fat excision without recurrence. There are few 
reports in the English literature describing surgical excision using the facelift
pattern for treating BSL.
