Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is most aggressive head and neck cancer
often associated with HR-HPV infection. The role of AP-1 which is an essential
regulator of HPV oncogene expression and tumorigenesis is not reported in tongue 
cancer. One hundred tongue tissue biopsies comprising precancer, cancer and
adjacent controls including two tongue cancer cell lines were employed to study
the role of HPV infection and AP-1 family proteins. An exclusive prevalence (28%)
of HR-HPV type 16 was observed mainly in well differentiated tongue carcinomas
(78.5%). A higher expression and DNA binding activity of AP-1 was observed in
tongue tumors and cancer cell lines with c-Fos and Fra-2 as the major binding
partners forming the functional AP-1 complex but c-Jun participated only in HPV
negative and poorly differentiated carcinoma. Knocking down of Fra-2 responsible 
for aggressive tongue tumorigenesis led to significant reduction in c-Fos, c-Jun,
MMP-9 and HPVE6/E7 expression but Fra-1 and p53 were upregulated. The binding and
expression of c-Fos/Fra-2 increased as a function of severity of tongue lesions, 
yet selective participation of c-Jun appears to promote poor differentiation and 
aggressive tumorigenesis only in HPV negative cases while HPV infection leads to 
well differentiation and better prognosis preferably in nonsmokers.
