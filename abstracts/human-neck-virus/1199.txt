In this first article of the "Do You Know Your Guidelines" series, we review
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations and underlying
evidence for the follow-up and surveillance of head and neck cancer survivors.
The goals of follow-up and surveillance care are (1) to maximize long-term
oncologic outcomes of therapy with appropriate evaluation for recurrence, (2) to 
maximize functional and quality of life outcomes, and (3) minimizing unnecessary 
and harmful low-value care. Finding the right balance of testing and surveillance
is a challenge for providers and patients. Herein, we review all NCCN
recommendations for head and neck cancer survivors. We pay particular attention
to an area of controversy: the use of ongoing surveillance imaging, in
particular, PET/CT scans.
