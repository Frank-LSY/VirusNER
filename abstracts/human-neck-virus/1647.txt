Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important etiological factor in head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Standard treatment of HPV-positive tumors with
platinum-based radio(chemo)therapy results in a better outcome than in
HPV-negative tumors. Electrochemotherapy is becoming an increasingly recognized
mode of treatment in different cancers; thus, its use in the management of head
and neck SCC is of considerable interest. However, response to
electrochemotherapy according to HPV status of the tumors has not been evaluated 
yet. Thus, our aim was to compare the effect of electrochemotherapy with
cisplatin or bleomycin between HPV-negative and HPV-positive human pharyngeal SCC
derived cell lines and tumor models. HPV-positive cells and tumors were found to 
be more sensitive to electrochemotherapy with cisplatin than HPV-negative ones,
whereas sensitivity to electrochemotherapy with bleomycin was similar
irrespective of the HPV status. The higher sensitivity of HPV-positive cells and 
tumors to electrochemotherapy with cisplatin is likely due to the higher level
and slower repair of DNA damage. In HPV-negative tumors, a higher number of
complete responses was recorded after bleomycin-based rather than cisplatin-based
electrochemotherapy, while in HPV-positive tumors electrochemotherapy with
cisplatin was more effective.
