BACKGROUND: With the rise of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma associated
with human papillomavirus (HPV), appropriate treatment strategies continue to be 
tailored toward minimizing treatment while preserving oncologic outcomes. This
study aimed to compare the outcomes for those undergoing transoral resection with
or without adjuvant therapy for HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: A case-match cohort analysis was performed at two institutions on
patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. All the subjects
underwent transoral surgery and neck dissection. The patients treated with
surgery alone were matched 1:1 to those treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy
using two groups identified as confounders: T-stage (T1/2 or T3/4) and number of 
pathologically positive lymph nodes (≤4 or >4).
RESULTS: The study identified 105 matched pairs, with a median follow-up period
of 42 months (range 3.1-102.3 months). The patients were staged as T1/T2 (86%) or
T3/4 (14%). Each group had five patients with more than four positive lymph
nodes. Adjuvant therapy significantly improved disease-free survival (hazard
ratio [HR] 0.067; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.62) and was associated with
a lower risk of local and regional recurrence (risk ratio [RR] 0.096; 95% CI
0.02-0.47). No difference in disease-specific survival (HR 0.22; 95% CI
0.02-2.57) or overall survival (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.01-2.4) was observed with the
addition of adjuvant therapy. The risk of the gastrostomy tube was higher for
those receiving adjuvant therapy (RR 7.3; 95% CI 2.6-20.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Transoral surgery is an effective approach for the treatment of
HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma. The addition of adjuvant therapy appears to 
decrease the risk of recurrence and improve disease-free survival but may not
significantly improve overall survival.
