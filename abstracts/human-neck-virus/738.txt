OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine viral load of human papillomavirus type 6
(HPV6), physical state of HPV6-DNA, and transcription level of HPV6 E7-mRNA in
laryngeal papilloma and in adjacent healthy mucosa.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: A papilloma biopsy was collected from each of 25 adult patients with
respiratory recurrent papillomatosis. From 14 of the 25 patients, we first
collected a biopsy from healthy mucosa of the false vocal fold and another from
the papilloma. Quantity of HPV6 and E7-mRNA was measured by polymerase chain
reaction.
RESULTS: For the papilloma, the median load of HPV6 was 41 copies/cell, and the
lowest amount was 5.4 copies/cell. Human papillomavirus type 6 was detected in
50% (7/14) of the healthy mucosa, with a median of 1.1 copies/cell, and the
highest amount was 6.6 copies/cell. Overall, viral load was higher in papilloma
than in healthy mucosa (P < 0.05). The average HPV6 E2/E7-DNA ratio was 1.3,
indicating an episomal state. Human papillomavirus type 6-mRNA was detected in
all HPV6-DNA-positive samples. The transcription median ratio of
HPV6-mRNA/HPV6-DNA was 1.5 in papilloma and 3.8 in healthy mucosa.
CONCLUSION: The amount of HPV6-DNA was consistently higher in the papilloma than 
in healthy mucosa. The transcription level of HPV6 E7 mRNA was similar in the
papilloma and in normal mucosa. We suggest that interfering with replication of
HPV6 and suppression of HPV6 to fewer than five copies/cell may be curative.
