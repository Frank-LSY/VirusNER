Rhinosinusitis is common in the pediatric population; however, diagnostic and
management techniques often differ when compared with adult rhinosinusitis.
Multidisciplinary guidelines have outlined the diagnostic criteria for pediatric 
rhinosinusitis. Although acute rhinosinusitis is a more infectious phenomenon,
chronic sinusitis involves a more multifactorial etiology. This article outlines 
some of the definitions of rhinosinusitis, diagnosis and management of pediatric 
sinusitis, and the complications of rhinosinusitis seen in the pediatric
population.
