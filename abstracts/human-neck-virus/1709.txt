Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity is one of the most common
neoplasms in the world. During the past 2 decades, the role of high-risk human
papilloma virus (HR-HPV) has been studied and the data supporting HPV as a one of
the causative agents in the development and progression of a sub-set of head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has accumulated. In order to investigate
the role of HR-HPV oncogene expression in early epithelial alterations in vivo,
we produced transgenic mice expressing HPV16 early region genes from the promoter
of the bovine keratin 6 gene (Tg[bK6-E6/E7]). In this article, we demonstrate
that E6/E7 transgene was abundantly expressed and cellular proliferation was
increased in the middle tongue epithelia of transgenic mice, and that in the same
region young (27 weeks old) Tg[bK6-E6/E7] mice spontaneously developed
histological alterations, mainly focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH).
