Genetic aberrations driving pro-oncogenic and pro-metastatic activity remain an
elusive target in the quest of precision oncology. To identify such drivers, we
use an animal model of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma to perform an in vivo
functional screen of 217 genetic aberrations selected from lung cancer genomics
datasets. We identify 28 genes whose expression promoted tumor metastasis to the 
lung in mice. We employ two tools for examining the KRAS-dependence of genes
identified from our screen: 1) a human lung cell model containing a regulatable
mutant KRAS allele and 2) a lentiviral system permitting co-expression of
DNA-barcoded cDNAs with Cre recombinase to activate a mutant KRAS allele in the
lungs of mice. Mechanistic evaluation of one gene, GATAD2B, illuminates its role 
as a dual activity gene, promoting both pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic
activities in KRAS-mutant lung cancer through interaction with c-MYC and
hyperactivation of the c-MYC pathway.
