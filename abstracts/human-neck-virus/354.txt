OBJECTIVES: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important cause of some head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), but its role in cancer of the lateral
tongue is debatable. Suspicion of HPV causation is heightened when these lateral 
tongue carcinomas arise in patients that are young and/or have never smoked. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of transcriptionally active 
high risk HPV in these tumors, with a particular emphasis on non-smoking patients
who are often presumed to have HPV-positive tumors.
METHODS: We evaluated 78 HNSCCs of the lateral tongue for the presence of HPV
using p16 immunohistochemistry and an RNA in situ hybridization assay targeting
HPV E6/E7 mRNA. The study population was enriched for patients without
traditional risk factors such as smoking and drinking.
RESULTS: P16 overexpression was detected in 9 (11.5%) of 78 cases, but HPV E6/E7 
mRNA transcripts were detected in only 1 (1.3%) case (positive predictive value
of p16 staining for the presence of transcriptionally active HPV=0.12). HPV mRNA 
transcripts were not detected in any patient under 40 (n=11), or in patients who 
had never smoked (n=44), had quit smoking (n=15), and/or were only light
consumers of alcohol (n=57).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV is not detected in the vast majority of lateral tongue
carcinomas. In light of the observation that HPV plays little if any role in the 
development of these cancers, routine HPV testing is unwarranted , even for
patients without traditional risk factors. P16 staining is not a reliable marker 
for the presence of transcriptionally active HPV at this particular anatomic
site.
