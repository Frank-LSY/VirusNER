Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus often infecting humans. It is often present
on skin or mucous membranes. These diverse DNA viruses are often linked to many
various benign and malignant neoplastic lesions. Over 40 types of HPV are
transmitted through sexual contact and infect the anogenital region which might
be secondly transmitted to the oral mucous. Over 150 HPV viruses are defined
according to the invaded site. Oral papillomas are marked with numbers 6, 7, 11, 
16 and 32. Squamous cell papilloma is often found in laryngeal epithelial tumor
associated with HPV-6 and HPV-11 and also HPV-16 in oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC). In the last 15 years OSCC has become more common in children and young
adults. The role of HPV virus causing oral squamous cell carcinomas is more often
realized, but people's lack of knowledge and risky sexual behavior is still the
main factor in growing HPV infections.
