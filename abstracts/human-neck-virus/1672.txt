OBJECTIVES: The aim of the survey was to introduce knowledge of HPV's role in
head and neck pathologies to general physicians (GPs), otorhinolaryngologists
(ENTs) and newly graduated doctors, as well as to promote HPV-related diseases
prevention.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Self-designed questionnaire was sent to 2100 doctors. A total of 404
doctors, including 144 ENTs, 192 GPs and 68 trainees, responded.
RESULTS: The majority of ENTs (86.8%) had contact with recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis (RRP) and oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) patients; in contrast, the 
majority of GPs (55.7%) did not (p = 0.00). The knowledge of HPV aetiology of
cervical cancer versus OPCs and RRP was statistically higher. 7% of ENTs, 20% of 
GPs and 10% of trainees had not heard about HPV in oropharyngeal diseases. Women 
had greater knowledge than men. Both in the group of GPs and ENTs, 100% of
respondents had heard about the impact of vaccination on the reduction of
cervical cancer incidence. Only 39.11% of respondents had heard about the
possibility of using vaccination against HPV in RRP-ENT doctors significantly
more often than GPs and trainees (p = 0.00). Only 28.96% of physicians had heard 
about the potential value of HPV vaccination in preventing OPCs, including 44.44%
of ENT doctors, 23.44% of GPs and 11.76% of trainees (p = 0.00). The doctors from
district hospitals showed lower level of knowledge compared with clinicians (p = 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The different levels of knowledge and awareness of HPV issues
highlight the need for targeted awareness strategies in Poland with
implementation of HPV testing and vaccination. The information should be
accessible especially to those with lower education levels: ENTs from small,
provincial wards, GPs from cities of < 200,000 inhabitants and older physicians. 
The incorporation of HPV issues into the studies curriculum would be fruitful in 
terms of improving the knowledge of trainees.
