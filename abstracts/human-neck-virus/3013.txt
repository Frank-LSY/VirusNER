OBJECTIVE: HIV/AIDS is responsible for widespread clinical manifestations
involving the head, and neck. The prevalence and nature of vestibular involvement
is still largely unknown. This study, aimed to describe and compare the
occurrence and nature of vestibular involvement among a group of, adults infected
with HIV compared to a control group. It also aimed to compare the vestibular
function, of symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV positive adults who receive
antiretroviral (ARV) therapies to, subjects not receiving ARV.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 53 adults (29 male, 24 female, 
aged 23-49 years, mean=38.5, SD=4.4) infected with HIV, compared to a control
group of 38 HIV negative adults (18, male, 20 female, aged 20-49 years,
mean=36.9, SD=8.2). A structured interview probed the subjective, perception of
vestibular symptoms. Medical records were reviewed for CD4+ cell counts and the
use of, ARV medication. An otologic assessment and a comprehensive vestibular
assessment (bedside, assessments, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, ocular
motor and positional tests and bithermal, caloric irrigation) were conducted.
RESULTS: Vestibular involvement occurred in 79.2% of subjects with HIV in all
categories of disease, progression, compared to 18.4% in those without HIV.
Vestibular involvement increased from 18.9% in CDC category 1 to 30.2% in
category 2. Vestibular involvement was 30.1% in category 3. There were,
vestibular involvement in 35.9% of symptomatic HIV positive subjects, and 41.5%
in asymptomatic, HIV positive subjects. There was no significant difference in
the occurrence of vestibular involvement, in subjects receiving ARV therapies
compared to those not receiving ARV therapies (p=.914; chi-square, test). The
odds ratio indicates that individuals with HIV have a 16.61 times higher risk of 
developing, vestibular involvement during their lifetime of living with the
disease and that it may occur despite, being asymptomatic.
CONCLUSION: Vestibular involvement was significantly more common in subjects with
HIV. Primary health care providers could screen HIV positive patients to
ascertain if there are symptoms of vestibular involvement. If there are any, then
they may consider further vestibular assessments and subsequent vestibular
rehabilitation therapy.
