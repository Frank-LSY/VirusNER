Although acute Zika virus infection is typically mild and self-limited, researchers have demonstrated serious neurologic complications associated with it such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Otolaryngologists should be aware of head and neck manifestations which include conjunctivitis, retro-orbital pain, cephalgia, and odynophagia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed specific molecular and serologic testing protocols and algorithms for follow-up care of suspected cases. Currently, the mainstay of management is conservative care while researchers attempt to develop a vaccine. Strategies to contain the Zika virus include vector control, travel restriction for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, and avoidance of mosquito bites in endemic regions of the world.
