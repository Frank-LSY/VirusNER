Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are major human carcinogens. The
expression of the viral E6/E7 oncogenes plays a key role for HPV-linked
oncogenesis. It recently has been found that low oxygen concentrations
("hypoxia"), as present in sub-regions of HPV-positive cancers, strongly affect
the interplay between the HPV oncogenes and their transformed host cell. As a
result, a state of dormancy is induced in hypoxic HPV-positive cancer cells,
which is characterized by a shutdown of viral oncogene expression and a
proliferative arrest that can be reversed by reoxygenation. In this review, these
findings are put into the context of the current concepts of both HPV-linked
carcinogenesis and of the effects of hypoxia on tumor biology. Moreover, we
discuss the consequences for the phenotype of HPV-positive cancer cells as well
as for their clinical behavior and response towards established and prospective
therapeutic strategies.
