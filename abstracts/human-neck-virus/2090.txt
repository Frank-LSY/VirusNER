OBJECTIVES: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) have an improved prognosis compared to
HPV-negative OPSCCs. Several theories have been proposed to explain this
relatively good prognosis. One hypothesis is a difference in immune response. In 
this study, we compared tumor-infiltrating CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T-cells, and granzyme
inhibitors (SERPINB1, SERPINB4, and SERPINB9) between HPV-positive and
HPV-negative tumors and the relation with survival.
METHODS: Protein expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (CD3, CD4,
and CD8) and granzyme inhibitors was analyzed in 262 OPSCCs by
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Most patients (67%) received primary radiotherapy
with or without chemotherapy. Cox regression analysis was carried out to compare 
overall survival (OS) of patients with low and high TIL infiltration and
expression of granzyme inhibitors.
RESULTS: HPV-positive OPSCCs were significantly more heavily infiltrated by TILs 
(p < 0.001) compared to HPV-negative OPSCCs. A high level of CD3+ TILs was
correlated with a favorable outcome in the total cohort and in HPV-positive
OPSCCs, while it reached no significance in HPV-negative OPSCCs. There was
expression of all three granzyme inhibitors in OPSCCs. No differences in
expression were found between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCCs. Within the
group of HPV-positive tumors, a high expression of SERPINB1 was associated with a
significantly worse overall survival.
CONCLUSION: HPV-positive OPSCCs with a low count of CD3+ TILs or high expression 
of SERPINB1 have a worse OS, comparable with HPV-negative OPSCCs. This suggests
that the immune system plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of the
virally induced oropharynx tumors.
