Purpose: The primary cause of death due to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) is local treatment failure. The goal of this study was to examine this
phenomenon using an unbiased approach.Experimental Design: We utilized human
papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cell lines rendered radiation-resistant (RR) via
repeated exposure to radiation, a panel of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines and
three cohorts of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors (n = 68, 97, and 114) from patients
treated with radiotherapy and subjected to genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic
analysis.Results: RR cell lines exhibited upregulation of several proteins
compared with controls, including increased activation of Axl and PI3 kinase
signaling as well as increased expression of PD-L1. Additionally, inhibition of
either Axl or PI3 kinase led to decreased PD-L1 expression. When clinical samples
were subjected to RPPA and mRNA expression analysis, PD-L1 was correlated with
both Axl and PI3K signaling as well as dramatically associated with local failure
following radiotherapy. This finding was confirmed examining a third cohort using
immunohistochemistry. Indeed, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 had failure
rates following radiotherapy of 60%, 70%, and 50% compared with 20%, 25%, and 20%
in the PD-L1-low expression group (P = 0.01, 1.9 × 10-3, and 9 × 10-4,
respectively). This finding remained significant on multivariate analysis in all 
groups. Additionally, patients with PD-L1 low/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
high had no local failure or death due to disease (P = 5 × 10-4 and P = 4 × 10-4,
respectively).Conclusions: Taken together, our data point to a targetable Axl-PI3
kinase-PD-L1 axis that is highly associated with radiation resistance. Clin
