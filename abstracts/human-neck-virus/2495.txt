OBJECTIVE: To present the rise and decline of allograft tympanoplasty and
investigate how the challenges it has faced may inform us of its future.
DATA SOURCES: Articles and books published over the last 48 years that refer to
allograft tympanoplasty or its historical roots.
HISTORY: The first published account of allograft tympanoplasty is by Ned Chalat 
in 1964; however, whether he was the first to use the technique is controversial.
In 1966, Jean Marquet published the first clinically successful use of allograft 
tympanic membranes. Since that time, a number of surgeons have trialed both en
bloc tympano-ossicular techniques and tympanomeatal techniques with separate
ossicle interposition or columellar reconstruction, often with considerable
success. The advent of the human immunodeficiency virus and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's
disease resulted in a reduction in its application; however, a number of centers 
are still successfully using the technique in their current practice.
CONCLUSION: Whether allograft tympanoplasty will have a place in the future of
otology remains to be seen, but an understanding of the history of this technique
is essential in evaluating its merit.
