BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article was to study the association of human
papillomavirus (HPV) with clinical outcomes in patients with recurrent or
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Archival baseline tumor specimens were obtained from
patients treated on two clinical trials in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN: E1395, 
a phase III trial of cisplatin and paclitaxel versus cisplatin and
5-fluorouracil, and E3301, a phase II trial of irinotecan and docetaxel. HPV DNA 
was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) with a wide-spectrum probe. p16
status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Clinical outcomes of interest were 
objective response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: We analyzed 64 patients for HPV ISH and 65 for p16. Eleven tumors (17%) 
were HPV+, 12 (18%) were p16+, whereas 52 (80%) were both HPV- and p16-. The
objective response rate was 55% for HPV-positive versus 19% for HPV-negative (P =
0.022), and 50% for p16-positive versus 19% for p16-negative (P = 0.057). The
median survival was 12.9 versus 6.7 months for HPV-positive versus HPV-negative
patients (P = 0.014), and 11.9 versus 6.7 months for p16-positive versus
p16-negative patients (P = 0.027). After adjusting for other covariates, hazard
ratio for OS was 2.69 (P = 0.048) and 2.17 (P = 0.10), favoring HPV-positive and 
p16-positive patients, respectively. The other unfavorable risk factor for OS was
loss of ≥5% weight in previous 6 months (P = 0.0021 and 0.023 for HPV and p16
models, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HPV is a favorable prognostic factor in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
that should be considered in the design of clinical trials in this setting.
