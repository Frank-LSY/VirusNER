Cisplatin (DNA intercalator), a standard chemotherapy drug often used to treat
head and neck squamous cellular carcinoma (HNSCC) has very low response rates in 
recurrent disease of HNSCC, this is a major clinical problem today. However, a
valuable window to look in to the underlying molecular aspects of a favorable and
unfavorable cisplatin response is offered by a distinct disease entity in HNSCC -
HPV+ OPSCC. It responds far more favorably to cisplatin than non-HPV driven
HNSCC. Another intriguing aspect of head and neck cancer biology is the emergence
of the CD44+ cancer stem cell - the tumor initiating population that in all
likelihood is the root cause of therapeutic resistance. The critical question is,
are there any differences between the CD44+ CSC population of an HPV+ OPSCC and a
non-HPV HNSCC? In this regard, the inverse relation between EGFR levels and HPV
status in OPSCC may be a common thread that connects the better response rates of
HPV+ OPSCC with the contribution of CD44+ stem cells of HNSCC to chemoresistance.
