CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (C-ALCL) is an
indolent type of cutaneous lymphoma with favourable clinical prognosis.
Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia (PCH) is a rare benign epithelial condition that 
can resemble invasive squamous cell carcinoma both clinically and
histopathologically. PCH predominantly occurs in CD30-positive
lymphoproliferative disorders. We report a 75-year-old woman with PCH in a
multifocal C-ALCL located on the scalp and right retroauricular area, which
rapidly responded to treatment with psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy.
Comprehensive virological analyses for potential oncogenic viruses, including
Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus-8, human papillomaviruses, the recently
discovered cutavirus and nine different human polyomaviruses, were negative.
