The incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has
increased more than 200% in the past 20 years. Recent genetic sequencing efforts 
have elucidated relevant genes in head and neck cancer, but HPV-related tumors
have consistently shown few DNA mutations. In this study, we sought to analyze
alternative splicing events (ASE) that could alter gene function independent of
mutations. To identify ASE unique to HPV-related tumors, RNA sequencing was
performed on 46 HPV-positive OPSCC and 25 normal tissue samples. A novel
algorithm using outlier statistics on RNA-sequencing junction expression
identified 109 splicing events, which were confirmed in a validation set from The
Cancer Genome Atlas. Because the most common type of splicing event identified
was an alternative start site (39%), MBD-seq genome-wide CpG methylation data
were analyzed for methylation alterations at promoter regions. ASE in six genes
showed significant negative correlation between promoter methylation and
expression of an alternative transcriptional start site, including AKT3 The novel
AKT3 transcriptional variant and methylation changes were confirmed using qRT-PCR
and qMSP methods. In vitro silencing of the novel AKT3 variant resulted in
significant growth inhibition of multiple head and neck cell lines, an effect not
observed with wild-type AKT3 knockdown. Analysis of ASE in HPV-related OPSCC
identified multiple alterations likely involved in carcinogenesis, including a
novel, functionally active transcriptional variant of AKT3 Our data indicate that
ASEs represent a significant mechanism of oncogenesis with untapped potential for
understanding complex genetic changes that result in the development of cancer.
