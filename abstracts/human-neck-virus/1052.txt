BACKGROUND: Extracapsular spread (ECS) is commonly used to justify adjuvant
chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. The role of ECS as a
prognosticator and adjuvant therapy determinant in surgically resected, human
papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), however,
has never been determined.
METHODS: Of 210 oropharynx patients in a prospective transoral laser microsurgery
database, 152 patients who had p16-positive primary OPSCC and pathologically
positive necks were eligible for the study. ECS was measured from routine
reporting (ECS(report)) and by using a novel histologic grading system
(ECS(graded)). Proportional hazards models and matched analyses were used to
compare the impact of ECS and adjuvant therapy on disease-free survival (DFS).
Patients with and without graded ECS were matched for T-stage, surgical margins, 
and adjuvant therapy.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 43 months, the presence of ECS was not
associated with poorer DFS in multivariate analyses (ECS(report): hazard ratio
[HR], 3.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-25.88; P = .23; ECS(graded): HR,
2.54; 95% CI, 0.88-7.34; P = .09). T-stage and high-grade ECS, ie soft tissue
metastasis (STM(graded)) were prognostic. Overall and in the presence of ECS or
even STM, adjuvant CRT was not associated with better DFS over radiotherapy alone
(HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-1.13; P = .07). In addition, matched analyses
demonstrated no significant reduction in DFS for the presence of ECS versus the
absence of ECS or reduced DFS for the administration of adjuvant radiotherapy
alone versus CRT in ECS-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Routinely reported ECS was not prognostic in this study. Adjuvant
CRT versus radiotherapy alone produced no improvement in DFS for ECS-positive
patients. The authors propose that de-escalated adjuvant therapy should be
considered for patients with p16-positive OPSCC who undergo surgery and that
routinely reported ECS should not be used to justify adjuvant chemotherapy.
