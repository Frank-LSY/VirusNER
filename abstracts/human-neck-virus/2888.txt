Infections of the head and neck vary in their clinical course and outcome because
of the diversity of organs and anatomic compartments involved. Imaging plays a
central role in delineating the anatomic extent of the disease process,
identifying the infection source, and detecting complications. The utility of
imaging to differentiate between a solid phlegmonous mass and an abscess cannot
be overemphasized. This review briefly describes and pictorially illustrates the 
typical imaging findings of some important head and neck infections, such as
malignant otitis externa, otomastoiditis bacterial and fungal sinusitis, orbital 
cellulitis, sialadenitis, cervical lymphadenitis, and deep neck space infections.
