Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are closely linked to the
development of anogenital and head and neck cancers . The expression of the viral
E6 and E7 genes is crucial for the transforming activities of HPVs. There is
accumulating evidence that the HPV E6/E7 oncogenes can profoundly affect the
cellular microRNA (miRNA) composition. Since alterations of miRNA expression
levels can contribute to cancer development and maintenance, it will be important
to understand in depth the crosstalk between the HPV oncogenes and the cellular
miRNA network . Here, we describe a method to identify E6/E7-dependent
intracellular miRNAs by small RNA deep sequencing , upon silencing of endogenous 
E6/E7 expression in HPV-positive cancer cells in vitro. In addition, we provide a
protocol to identify E6/E7-dependent miRNA alterations in exosomes that are
secreted by HPV-positive cancer cells in vitro.
