Objective To determine the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in the larynx without the bias of other sublocations, and to describe the different serotypes of HPV and their impact on overall and disease-free survival after 10-year follow-up. Study Design Retrospective case series with chart review of ear, nose, and throat oncologic database. Setting Academic tertiary care hospital. Subjects A total of 123 samples of larynx squamous cell carcinoma were included, only from the glottis and treated only with surgery between 1977 and 2005. Methods DNA extraction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent visualization was performed in low-density arrays. Results were compared with histologic, clinicopathologic, and survival parameters, with a 10-year follow-up. Results HPV DNA was detected in 22.76% (n = 28) of the samples. Eleven genotypes were detected, 2 of which had never been described in the larynx (HPV43 and HPV62). No increasing trend of HPV was observed over time. HPV presence did not correlate with better survival during the follow-up. Smoking was proven as an independent factor in relation to the presence of HPV. Conclusion HPV may represent a notable factor in the development of a subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma without significant influence on overall and disease-free survival. More studies, including oncogene transcription proteins, would be necessary to draw more relevant conclusions about the relevance of HPV infection in the larynx.
