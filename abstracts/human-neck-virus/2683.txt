BACKGROUND: Epigenetic and genetic alteration plays a major role to the
development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Consumption of
tobacco (smoking/chewing) and human papilloma virus (HPV) are also associated
with an increase the risk of HNSCC. Promoter hypermethylation of the tumor
suppression genes is related with transcriptional inactivation and loss of gene
expression. We investigated epigenetic alteration (promoter methylation of
tumor-related genes/loci) in tumor tissues in the context of genetic alteration, 
viral infection, and tobacco exposure and survival status.
METHODOLOGY: The study included 116 tissue samples (71 tumor and 45 normal
tissues) from the Northeast Indian population. Methylation specific polymerase
chain reaction (MSP) was used to determine the methylation status of 10
tumor-related genes/loci (p16, DAPK, RASSF1, BRAC1, GSTP1, ECAD, MLH1, MINT1,
MINT2 and MINT31). Polymorphisms of CYP1A1, GST (M1 & T1), XRCC1and XRCC2 genes
were studied by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and multiplex-PCR respectively.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on
methylation pattern had identified two tumor clusters, which significantly differ
by CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), tobacco, GSTM1, CYP1A1, HPV and
survival status. Analyzing methylation of genes/loci individually, we have found 
significant higher methylation of DAPK, RASSF1, p16 and MINT31 genes (P = 0.031, 
0.013, 0.031 and 0.015 respectively) in HPV (+) cases compared to HPV (-).
Furthermore, a CIMP-high and Cluster-1 characteristic was also associated with
poor survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Promoter methylation profiles reflecting a correlation with tobacco,
HPV, survival status and genetic alteration and may act as a marker to determine 
subtypes and patient outcome in HNSCC.
