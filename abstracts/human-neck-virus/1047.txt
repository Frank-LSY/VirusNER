Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a relatively common human
cancer characterized by high morbidity, high mortality, and few therapeutic
options outside of surgery, standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation.
Although the most important risk factors are tobacco use and alcohol consumption,
the disease is also linked to infection with high-risk types of human papilloma
viruses (HPVs). Recent genetic analyses have yielded new insights into the
molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Overall, while somatic activating
mutations within classical oncogenes including PIK3CA and RAS occur in HNSCC,
they are relatively uncommon. Instead genetic data point to a contribution of
multiple tumor suppressor pathways, including p53, Rb/INK4/ARF, and Notch, in
tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance. The increasingly refined
knowledge of HNSCC genetics, combined with ever-more-sophisticated animal models 
and newer drug targeting strategies, should promote novel therapeutic approaches 
and improved disease outcomes.
