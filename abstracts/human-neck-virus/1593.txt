PURPOSE: Concurrent radio-chemotherapy (RT-CT) is the standard treatment for
locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC), but RT plus
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is an effective option when CT
is not appropriate. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with an improved
prognosis in LA-HNSCC; however, it has not been fully studied as a prognostic
factor after RT + EGFR inhibitors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemical expression of p16INK4A and PCR of HPV16 
DNA were retrospectively analyzed in tumor blocks from 52 stage III/IV LA-HNSCC
patients treated with RT + EGFR inhibitors. Disease-free survival (DFS) and
overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: DNA of HPV16 was found in six of 52 tumors (12 %) and p16 positivity in 
eight tumors (15 %). After a median follow-up time of 45 months (6-110),
p16-positive patients treated with RT + EGFR inhibitors showed an improved DFS
(2-year DFS 75 vs. 44 %, HR 0.25, 95 % CI 0.06-0.99, p = 0.047) compared with
p16-negative patients. These differences were outperformed when compared by HPV16
status (2-year OS rates of 83 vs. 58 %, HR 0.17, 95 % CI 0.02-0.99, p = 0.049 and
2-year DFS rates of 83 vs. 45 %, HR 0.17, 95 % CI 0.02-0.99, p = 0.049). In the
Cox regression analysis with OS as the end point, ECOG 0-1 was the only
prognostic factor independently associated with a good prognosis in the
multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: In this study, p16/HPV16-positive patients with LA-HNSCC treated with
RT + EGFR inhibitors showed a better survival, not confirmed in multivariate
analysis.
