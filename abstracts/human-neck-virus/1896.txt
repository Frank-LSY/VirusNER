Disseminated cutaneous varicella herpes zoster with visceral involvement is rare 
and seen almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients. We describe an unusual
case of fulminant herpes zoster (HZ) in a healthy, immunocompetent 37-year-old
woman. She initially presented to an urgent care centre with a classic HZ rash
localised to her neck, and upper respiratory symptoms and was treated with
prednisone and cephalexin. Within 1 week, the rash became diffuse and her
clinical status rapidly deteriorated with development of severe acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Varicella zoster infection was confirmed via skin biopsy,
bronchial viral PCR and serology for varicella antibodies. She was successfully
treated with intravenous acyclovir and aggressive supportive care. Though
physicians readily recognise typical zoster infection, this case reminds
clinicians that HZ infection can be fulminant and potentially life-threatening in
younger, immunocompetent individuals. Early recognition and antiviral therapy is 
important to reduce morbidity and mortality.
