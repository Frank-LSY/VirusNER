Molluscum contagiosum is a self-limited disease that presents as small papules
with central umbilication. Similar to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and
tinea corporis, participation in wrestling is a risk factor for molluscum
infection in children and adults. Referred to as herpes gladiatorum, HSV-1 causes
cutaneous or ocular infections in wrestlers. We propose that molluscum
contagiosum be referred to as "molluscum gladiatorum" when infection occurs in
the context of wrestling. We report a case of a high school wrestler who
presented with molluscum lesions on his neck.
