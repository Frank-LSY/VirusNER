Accurate assessment of the prevalence of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in oropharyngeal tumours (OpSCC) is important because HPV-positive OpSCC are consistently associated with an improved overall survival. Recently, an algorithm has become available that reliably detects clinically relevant HPV in tumour tissue, however, no complete cohorts have been tested. The aim was to determine the prevalence of active high-risk HPV infection in a complete cohort of OpSCC collected over a 16-year period.
