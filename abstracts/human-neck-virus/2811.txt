OBJECTIVES: Following human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) develops secondary to dysfunction of innate and 
adaptive immune responses. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common medical disorder;
these patients are considered to be relatively immunocompromised. It is
hypothesized that comorbid DM occurs more frequently than expected in a cohort of
adult RRP patients and that RRP patients with DM have more severe disease than
those without DM.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care laryngology practice, 5-year period.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adult-onset RRP patients from 2007 to 2012 at the
University of Washington were reviewed. The gender, age of onset of RRP, number
of interventions, pathology, presence or absence of DM, and calculated anatomic
Derkay severity score were recorded.
RESULTS: Eighty-four adult RRP patients were characterized; 64 male (76%) and 20 
female (24%). Six of 84 patients (7.1%) had DM; this prevalence was not higher
than an age-matched general population. The number of interventions required for 
disease control did not significantly differ (P = .13) between adult RRP patients
with DM (avg 2.6/yr, median 2.3/year) and those without DM (avg 1.9/yr, median
1.3/yr). There was no significant difference in anatomic Derkay score at the time
of intervention (P = .26) or presence of dysplasia in biopsy specimens (P = .49) 
between RRP patients with and without DM.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of adult RRP patients, DM does not appear to
have a higher prevalence than that seen in age-matched controls, nor do RRP
patients with DM appear to have more severe disease.
