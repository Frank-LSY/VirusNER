BACKGROUND: Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) have been
shown to have distinct outcome profiles based on their human papillomavirus (HPV)
status. The purpose of this study was to assess HPV-related outcomes after
transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with adjuvant therapy as indicated.
METHODS: This study consisted of a retrospective review of 50 patients with OPSCC
within a prospective single-arm cohort study. Outcome measures included HPV
status, margin status, relapse pattern, and survival.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were HPV-positive (74.0%) with 34 patients (91.9%)
being serotype-16. Negative margins were achieved in 92.3% (HPV-negative) and
94.6% (HPV-positive). In the HPV-negative group, there were no local recurrences 
and 1 patient had both regional and distant recurrence (7.7%). In the
HPV-positive group, there were no local or regional recurrences and 2 patients
(5.4%) had distant recurrences. There were no statistically significant
differences in survival between the 2 cohorts (overall survival, disease-specific
survival, disease-free survival).
CONCLUSION: TORS as a primary surgical modality, followed by adjuvant therapy as 
indicated, offers disease control in both HPV-negative and HPV-positive groups.
We believe that multi-institutional studies are warranted to further evaluate
this novel approach for patients who are HPV negative and HPV positive.
