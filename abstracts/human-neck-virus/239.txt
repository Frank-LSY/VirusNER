BACKGROUND: Hochuekkito (HKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo),
has been used to treat symptoms of several diseases. In a recent clinical study, 
HKT was shown to be protective against the influenza virus infection. However,
the underlying mechanism of the prophylactic effect is not clear. Mitochondrial
and glycolytic pathways play important roles in cellular energy metabolism to
maintain biological functions. These metabolic pathways are affected by the
influenza virus infection. In this study, we examined the relationship between
the preventive effects of HKT against the influenza virus infection and cellular 
energy metabolism in mitochondria and glycolysis using Madin-Darby canine kidney 
cells and influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus (IAV).
METHODS: Mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic pathways were evaluated on the
basis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate
(ECAR), respectively, using the XF24 Extracellular Analyzer.
RESULTS: The OCR/ECAR ratio in IAV-infected cells was lower than that in control 
cells. Cells that were treated with HKT before IAV infection showed a metabolic
pattern similar to that in the control cells (increase in both OCR and ECAR).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HKT not only activates both mitochondrial
and glycolytic energy metabolism in IAV-infected cells but also helps maintain
metabolic homeostasis similar to that in noninfected cells.
