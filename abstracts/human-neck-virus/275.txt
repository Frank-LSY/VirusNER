BACKGROUND: Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can lead to
development of cancer of the head and neck and anogenital regions. G-rich
sequences found in genomes of high-risk HPVs can fold into non-canonical
secondary structures that could serve as 3D motifs distinct from double-stranded 
DNA and present recognition sites for ligands and opportunity for gene expression
modulation.
METHODS: Combination of UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy and PAGE electrophoresis were
used as they offer complementary insights into structural changes of G-rich
oligonucleotides.
RESULTS: G-rich region of HPV16 is shown to preferentially form hairpin
structures, while regions of HPV18, HPV52 and HPV58 fold into four-stranded DNA
structures called G-quadruplexes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms found in G-rich
sequences have been found to promote formation of hairpin structures of HPV16 and
have affected number of species formed in G-rich region of HPV52, whereas they
have exhibited minimal effect on the formation of HPV18 and HPV58 G-quadruplex
structures. These structural changes were reflected in differences in apparent
thermal stabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential of G-rich sequences as drug targets was evaluated based on
the results of the current study. HPV16 and HPV18 are considered less appropriate
targets due to several single nucleotide polymorphisms and low stability,
respectively. On the other hand, HPV52 and HPV58 could be used for small-molecule
mediated stabilization.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: G-rich sequences occurring in high-risk HPVs can fold into 
hairpin and G-quadruplex structures that could be potentially utilized as drug
targets. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "G-quadruplex" Guest
