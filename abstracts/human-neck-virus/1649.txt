BACKGROUND: Acute dengue myositis is characterized by fever and myalgia (with or 
without muscle weakness).
METHOD: The 7 cases of acute dengue myositis were retrospectively evaluated in
the present study. Dengue myositis was diagnosed on the basis of a clinical
picture consistent with the infection, elevated creatine phosphokinase, normal
CSF, positive serum IgM for dengue virus, and the exclusion of other causes.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 19.4 (range 3-40) years. Majority (5) of
the patients were male. In our series 3 of the cases suffered from fulminant
myositis. They were characterized by generalized weaknesses which included the
respiratory muscles. All the 3 patients had markedly elevated creatine
phosphokinase levels (ranging from 16,590 to 117,200 IU/L). Two patients
suffering from fulminant myositis required mechanical ventilation. However, they 
succumbed to their illnesses. The third patient showed signs of improvement. One 
case had paraparesis and an elevated creatine phosphokinase level. However, a
spontaneous complete recovery was observed. The remaining 3 cases had
quadriparesis with trunk and neck weaknesses, sparing of respiratory muscles,
creatine phosphokinase levels up to 3000 U/L. However, a complete recovery was
observed in these patients within 4 weeks.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, early respiratory involvement, high creatine
phosphokinase values, and severe myalgia suggest a severe form of dengue
myositis.
