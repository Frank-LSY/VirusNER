OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the clinical stages of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies Rta/IgG,
EBNA1/IgA, VCA/IgA and EA/IgA.
METHODS: Serum samples obtained from 211 untreated patients with NPC categorized 
by the project of 92' stage were examined for the presence of the EBV antibodies 
Rta/IgG and EBNA1/IgA by enzyme-linked immnunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for
VCA/IgA and EA/IgA by immunoenzymatic assay. The positive rates and antibody
levels in the NPC patients in different TNM stages and clinical stages were
analyzed statistically.
RESULTS: No significant difference in Rta/IgG rA value was found in the NPC
patients in different TNM or clinical stages (P>0.05). The EBNA1/IgA rA value was
significantly lower in stage T1, N0, and clinical stage I than in the other
corresponding T stages, N stages and other clinical stage (P<0.05). The antibody 
titers of VCA/IgA and EA/IgA differed significantly between the N stages and the 
clinical stages (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The expression of EBV Rta/IgG is not associated with NPC stage. The
expression of EBNA1/IgA is relatively low in early NPC. The antibody level of
VCA/IgA and EA/IgA are significantly correlated to the degree of neck lymph node 
metastasis, and might be helpful to classify the clinical stages of NPC.
