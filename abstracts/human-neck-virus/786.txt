BACKGROUND: Geographic heterogeneity of human papillomavirus (HPV) involvement in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been observed over the last few
years. This trend has not been evaluated in the Philippines. Hence, this study
aims to provide for the first time a data on the prevalence of HPV in HNSCC in
the northwestern region of the Philippines.
METHODS: Two hundred one (201) biopsy samples (179 formalin fixed paraffin
embedded and 22 fresh frozen) from 163 Filipino HNSCC cases (oral cavity = 88;
larynx = 60; oropharynx = 15) diagnosed between 2003 to 2013 were initially
included in this study. HPV DNA was detected by two methods: (1) BSGP5+/6+-PCR/
multiplex human papillomavirus genotyping and (2) TaqMan probes-based real-time
qPCR. Presence of HPV type-specific transcripts were also analyzed by reverse
transcription-PCR with subsequent hybridization to oligonucleotide probes coupled
to Luminex beads. Co-amplification of the β-globin and ubiquitin C genes served
as internal positive controls for DNA and RNA analyses, respectively.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 163, 82 (50.3%) cases had at least one tissue
sample that was valid for molecular analysis. Only two of the DNA valid cases
(2.4%) were HPV DNA-positive (HPV11 and HPV33). All HPV mRNA assays rendered
negative results except for HPV11 transcripts. Results of this study may indicate
that there is probably very low prevalence of HPV-associated HNSCC among Filipino
adults living in a rural region of the Philippines. This study could serve as a
benchmark for designing follow-up studies that would assess possible changes in
trends of HNSCC among Filipinos in different ethnic regions of the country,
especially urban areas in which the population is expected to adapt Western style
sexual behavior. A prospective sampling of fresh frozen tissue is also highly
recommended to ensure better molecular analyses.
