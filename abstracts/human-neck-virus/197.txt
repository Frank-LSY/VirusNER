Distinguishing new primary lung tumours from lung metastasis in patients with
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a challenging clinical problem.
Histological examination is not always able to distinguish between these
scenarios as SCC is common in both sites. Here the authors present a case of
metachronous cancers of the head and neck and lung in which human papilloma virus
testing was proposed as a mechanism to distinguish primary from metastatic
carcinoma.
