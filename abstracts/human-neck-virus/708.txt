Purpose: DNA methylation in human papillomavirus-associated (HPV+) head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have importance for continuous expression of 
HPV oncogenes, tumor cell proliferation, and survival. Here, we determined
activity of a global DNA-demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-aza), against HPV+
HNSCC in preclinical models and explored it as a targeted therapy in a window
trial enrolling patients with HPV+ HNSCC.Experimental Design: Sensitivity of
HNSCC cells to 5-aza treatment was determined, and then 5-aza activity was tested
in vivo using xenografted tumors in a mouse model. Finally, tumor samples from
patients enrolled in a window clinical trial were analyzed to identify activity
of 5-aza therapy in patients with HPV+ HNSCC.Results: Clinical trial and
experimental data show that 5-aza induced growth inhibition and cell death in
HPV+ HNSCC. 5-aza reduced expression of HPV genes, stabilized p53, and induced
p53-dependent apoptosis in HNSCC cells and tumors. 5-aza repressed expression and
activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in HPV+ HNSCC, activated IFN response
in some HPV+ head and neck cancer cells, and inhibited the ability of HPV+
xenografted tumors to invade mouse blood vessels.Conclusions: 5-aza may provide
effective therapy for HPV-associated HNSCC as an alternative or complement to
standard cytotoxic therapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(23); 7276-87. ©2017 AACR.
