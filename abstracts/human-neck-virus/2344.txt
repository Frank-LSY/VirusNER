OBJECTIVE: The implication of human papilloma virus (HPV) in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is well established, especially in oropharyngeal 
SCC. HIV patients have a higher risk of persistent HPV infection. We investigated
the role of HPV in HNSCC carcinogenesis in HIV population.
DESIGN: Retrospective monocentric study.
METHODS: We studied HIV patients who presented with HNSCC between 1994 and 2014. 
For each patient, tumor characteristics, HIV disease, and survival information
were collected. Tumor HPV testing was performed using p16 immunohistochemistry
(IHC), in-situ hybridization and PCR. We assessed the percentage of HPV in this
population of HIV patients with HNSCC and compared HIV disease characteristics
based on HPV status.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included: 11 women/36 men, the median age was 
50 years. Tumor HPV testing was performed in 40 patients. Tumors were located in 
oropharynx (32%), oral cavity (32%), larynx (21%), and hypopharynx (11%). At the 
time of diagnosis, median CD4 level was 385 cells/μl, 31% of the patients were
stage (Centers for Disease Control, stage C). The percentage of HPV linked to
HNSCC for all locations in HIV patients was 30% (n = 12). HPV16 accounted for 50%
of all HPV genotypes. HPV positive status was associated with a CD4 nadir of less
than 200 (P = 0.026), but not with CD4 level at time of diagnosis (P = 0.414).
HPV-negative tumors tend to be associated with poorer 5-year overall survival
(hazard ratio = 2.9, P = 0.0711).
CONCLUSION: HPV plays a critical role in HNSCC development in HIV population. HIV
immunodeficiency may increase HPV persistence and progression of HNSCC.
