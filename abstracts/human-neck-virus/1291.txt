Emergence of a Novel Staging System for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Based on HPV Status.

Panwar A, Interval E, Lydiatt WM.

The staging of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has undergone key changes in
the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, set 
to take effect January 1, 2018. The most significant change relates to the
development of a novel staging system for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, distinct from that for non-HPV-associated
squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx. We describe the revised staging
parameters and the rationale in support of the changes.
