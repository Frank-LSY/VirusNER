This article outlines the biology of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of human mucosa and the cellular pathways that are altered through viral infection. The article provides a conceptual framework with which to understand the 2 major immunologic strategies to address HPV-related diseases: (1) prevention of primary HPV infection through the use of prophylactic vaccines and (2) treatment of established infection and diseases through therapeutic vaccines. Nonimmunologic therapy that targets cellular dysregulation induced by HPV infection is also discussed. The challenges in actualizing these conceptually attractive therapies on both a societal and biological level are examined.
