BACKGROUND: Sinusitis is diagnosed in 31 million individuals annually and has a
significant impact on health care expenditures. Otolaryngologists understand that
patient expectations, health knowledge, and the use of therapeutic options by
patients and primary care physicians (PCPs) vary greatly. The intent of this
study was to elucidate differences in the perspectives of patients, PCPs and
otolaryngologists regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal disease.
METHODS: Three surveys were developed with questions targeting sinonasal
infections: specifically, prevalence, diagnosis, physician prescribing patterns, 
treatment alternatives, and referral patterns to tertiary level physicians.
Surveys were distributed to adult patients (n = 113) at general health fairs,
whereas surveys for PCPs (n = 54) and otolaryngologists (n = 40) were obtained
from teaching conferences and professional networking events.
RESULTS: In a description of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), 43%
of patients attributed symptoms to allergic rhinitis, 28% to URIs, and 28% to
sinus infections. Despite this, 37% of patients still expected anti-bacterial
agents. In patients with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), 44% of patients would wait
<1 week to see a physician whereas 82% of otolaryngologists and 57% of PCPs felt 
waiting 1 week or more was appropriate. In an ambulatory care setting, 45% of
PCPs would chose to treat patients with 5 days of ARS symptoms whereas 32% of
otolaryngologists would treat patients (p = .22). For ARS, 70% of patients
expected antibiotics. Seventy percent of PCPs stated that they would refer a
patient to an otolaryngologist after a single episode of sinusitis.
CONCLUSION: Patients with sinonasal symptoms confuse URIs for sinusitis and
expect unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. PCPs and otolaryngologists vary
regarding indications for presentation to a physician, approaches to therapy, and
indications for referral to a tertiary provider in their respective practices.
