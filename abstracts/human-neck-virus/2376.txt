Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) 
play key roles in the tumor immune suppressive network and tumor progression.
However, precise roles of programmed death-1 (PD-1) in immunological functions of
MDSCs and TAMs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have not been
clearly elucidated. In the present study, we show that PD-1 and PD-L1 levels were
significantly higher in human HNSCC specimen than in normal oral mucosa. MDSCs
and TAMs were characterized in mice and human HNSCC specimen, correlated well
with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. αPD-1 treatment was well tolerated and
significantly reduced tumor growth in the HNSCC mouse model along with
significant reduction in MDSCs and TAMs in immune organs and tumors. Molecular
analysis suggests a reduction in the CD47/SIRPα pathway by PD-1 blockade, which
regulates MDSCs, TAMs, dendritic cell as well as effector T cells. Hence, these
data identify that PD-1/PD-L1 axis is significantly increased in human and mouse 
HNSCC. Adoptive αPD-1 immunotherapy may provide a novel therapeutic approach to
modulate the micro- and macro-environment in HNSCC.
