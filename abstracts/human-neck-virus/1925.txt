PURPOSE: Xerostomia remains a common side effect of head and neck irradiation.
Conflicting data exist regarding the likelihood of level IB involvement for
patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), and data are limited on
this risk in patients with human papillomavirus-positive disease. This study
examined surgically treated OPSCC to determine the risk of pathologic level IB
nodal involvement and to identify a cohort of patients in whom ipsilateral level 
IB radiation therapy may be safely omitted.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 102 submandibular nodal dissections were
identified (92 ipsilateral and 10 contralateral) in 92 patients from 2010 to 2016
in those undergoing primary surgical treatment and dissection of ipsilateral
level IB lymph nodes. Radiographically positive cases were excluded.
Retrospective chart review was used for data collection, and the rate of
pathologic level IB involvement was determined.
RESULTS: The ipsilateral level IB nodal station had negative imaging and
pathologically positive nodes at rates of 4.3% in OPSCC and 5.3% in human
papillomavirus-positive OPSCC. Positive node burden in the ipsilateral neck at
stations other than IB appeared to correlate with the risk of pathologic positive
IB (pIB+) nodes: 50% of pathologically IB-negative patients had 2 or more
positive nodes versus 75% of pIB+ patients who had 4 or more positive nodes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a low risk of pathologic level IB involvement in
early-stage OPSCC. High positive node burden in stations near level IB may be
associated with a higher chance of pathologic level IB involvement.
