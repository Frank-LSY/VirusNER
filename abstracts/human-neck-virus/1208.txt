Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 is a viral oncoprotein essential for host
cell transformation. Due to its role in HPV-induced cancers of the genital, head 
and neck epithelia, reliable protein-level determination of E6 expression would
be an invaluable diagnostic tool. Immunocytochemical detection and subcellular
localization of HPV16 E6 has been demonstrated with varying success and a
comprehensive review of techniques is lacking. To address these issues, we used
established monoclonal antibodies and optimized a standard immunocytochemical
method for E6 protein detection inside the HPV16 positive cell lines, SiHa and
CaSki. E6 oncoprotein was detected primarily in the nucleus. We also refined
quantitative analysis with a software to objectively differentiate between HPV16 
positive and negative cells. Our analysis was also able to differentiate
expression differences between SiHa and CaSki on par with RT-qPCR. Thus, we
provide a long-needed, robust protocol for antibody-mediated detection of the
HPV16 E6 oncoprotein inside cultured cells.
