Oncogenic HPV infection was found in 19.23% of HNSCCs, with genotype 16 predominating. HPV-related HNSCC tended to occur at younger age compared to non-HPV-related HNSCC. The commonest site for HPV-associated HNSSC in Ghana is the larynx, rather than the oropharynx as reported in other studies. Host factors may be responsible for the site difference and more work is required to further elucidate this.
