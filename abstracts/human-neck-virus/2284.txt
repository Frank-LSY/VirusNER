OBJECTIVES: The mutagenic processes underlying head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) are poorly understood. Pan-cancer mutational signature analyses
have identified a signature for APOBEC, a cytosine deaminase, in a subset of
cancers, including HNSCC. The role of APOBEC activity in HNSCC remains poorly
understood. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of APOBEC in HNSCC
pathogenesis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Utilizing bioinformatic approaches we explored the role of 
APOBEC mediated mutations in tumor exomes, transcriptomes and germline exomes
from 511HNSCC patients in the TCGA.
RESULTS: 58% of HNSCC were statistically enriched for the APOBEC signature.
APOBEC3A expression had the highest correlation coefficient with APOBEC mutation 
rate. Gene specific motif analysis revealed a slight predominance of APOBEC3A
mutations. Canonical pathway analysis demonstrated immune pathway upregulation in
APOBEC mutation rich samples. Overall mutational burden was positively correlated
with APOBEC enrichment.
CONCLUSIONS: APOBEC mediated mutations are highly prevalent in HNSCC. APOBEC3A is
the most likely gene to be active in HPV+ HNSCC. APOBEC activity correlates with 
upregulation of immune signaling pathways, supporting the hypothesis that APOBEC 
activity could be activated as part of the innate immune response.
