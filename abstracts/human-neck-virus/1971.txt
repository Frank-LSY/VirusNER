IMPORTANCE: The presence of extracapsular spread (ECS) of metastatic nodes is
considered a poor prognosticator in head and neck cancer, with postoperative
chemoradiation therapy often recommended over radiation therapy alone in such
cases. However, there is less clarity regarding the effect of ECS on human
papillomavirus-associated oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) or carcinoma
of unknown primary site (CUP).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of ECS according to human
papillomavirus status in OPSCC and CUP with survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigation was a retrospective cohort 
study performed between August 1998 and March 2015 at an academic teaching
hospital. Participants were 83 patients with OPSCC (n = 62) or CUP (n = 21)
undergoing neck dissection as part of initial treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Human papillomavirus status was determined by p16
immunohistochemistry. The presence of ECS was extrapolated from pathology
reports, and the extent of ECS was determined by rereview of original pathology
slides. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were
assessed.
RESULTS: Among 83 patients (71 male), there were 45 p16-positive and 38
p16-negative tumors. Fifty-one patients had ECS, which was graded as extensive in
43 cases. The median follow-up was 31 months for all patients and 50 months for
surviving patients. Among the entire cohort, adverse predictors of RFS were
p16-negative status (hazard ratio [HR], 9.4; 95% CI, 3.3-27.2) and ECS (HR, 6.5; 
95% CI, 2.0-21.6). Adverse predictors of DSS were p16-negative status (HR, 16.8; 
95% CI, 3.9-71.2) and ECS (HR, 8.3; 95% CI, 2.0-35.3). Among p16-negative
patients, ECS was significantly associated with worse RFS (HR, 9.7; 95% CI,
1.3-72.3) and DSS (HR, 8.7; 95% CI, 1.1-62.7). In contrast, among p16-positive
patients, ECS had no effect on RFS (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.2-7.8) or DSS (HR, 1.2;
95% CI, 0.1-18.7).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The presence of ECS appears to be associated with
survival in OPSCC and CUP according to p16 status. Our findings raise questions
regarding the benefits of postoperative chemoradiation therapy in p16-positive
patients with ECS.
