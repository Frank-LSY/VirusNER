BACKGROUND: There is much evidence that high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
plays a causative role in a subset of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) 
in adults. HPV-positive tumors behave differently even in their response to
treatment and are therefore a distinct subset. Both HPV-positive and HPV-negative
tumors of the head and neck region are usually in the domain of adults and cases 
in children are rare; thus when a 2‑year-old child was diagnosed with this cancer
in the external auditory canal, an in-depth assessment of the tumor was
considered necessary.
CASE REPORT: A 2‑year-old girl was born to a HPV-positive mother who was
diagnosed with cervical cancer during pregnancy. The child was delivered by
caesarean section and the mother died of her cancer 7 months after delivery.
After the diagnosis of locally invasive HPV-positive squamous cell cancer of the 
external auditory canal, the child was treated surgically, and with chemotherapy 
and radiotherapy. Full remission was obtained lasting up to 325 weeks since
treatment was started, resulting in over 6 years of disease-free survival.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case of advanced, HPV-related HNSCC in a 2‑year-old
child, in whom the tumor was located in the external auditory canal and who made 
a dramatic recovery after treatment with nonradical surgery, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. The child has currently been disease free for 6 years. This case
supports the observation that HPV-related HNSCC tumors appear to respond
favorably to treatment despite the patient's young age and the clinically
advanced stage of the tumor.
