Enlarged neck lymph nodes are very often subject to fine needle aspiration biopsy to detect metastatic disease in patients with suspected or proven squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck region. Cytology specimens of metastatic carcinoma in such patients are routinely evaluated for human papilloma virus (HPV) to identify patients with HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Different types of cytology specimens including smears, cytospins, cell blocks and aspirated material in the rinse can all be used for different types of HPV testing such as immunohistochemistry for p16, HPV-in situ hybridization, and HPV-Polymerase chain reaction. There is currently no consensus regarding the testing of high-risk HPV in cytology specimens. The establishment of standardized HPV testing of cytology specimens is of utmost importance and is eagerly awaited.
