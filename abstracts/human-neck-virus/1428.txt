BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas response
better to X-ray therapy (XRT) than HPV-negative disease. Whether HPV status
influences the sensitivity of head and neck cancer cells to proton therapy or the
relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons versus XRT is unknown.
METHODS: Clonogenic survival was used to calculate the RBE; immunocytochemical
analysis and neutral comet assay were used to evaluate unrepaired DNA
double-strand breaks.
RESULTS: HPV-positive cells were more sensitive to protons and the unrepaired
double-strand breaks were more numerous in HPV-positive cells than in
HPV-negative cells (p < .001). Protons killed more cells than did XRT at all
fraction sizes (all RBEs > 1.06). Cell line type and radiation fraction size
influenced the RBE.
CONCLUSION: HPV-positive cells were more sensitive to protons than HPV-negative
cells maybe through the effects of HPV on DNA damage and repair. The RBE for
protons depends more on cell type and fraction size than on HPV status. © 2016
