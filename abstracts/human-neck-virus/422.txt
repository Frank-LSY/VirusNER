BACKGROUND: Although HPV emerged as a crucial carcinogenic and prognostic
biomarker in head and neck cancer, and considering the increase in HPV-associated
oral lesions (HPV-OLs) in HIV individuals, molecular information about HPV-OLs is
scarce; thus, our aim was to determine viral loads in HPV-OLs from HIV/AIDS
individuals.
METHODS: HIV/AIDS subjects with HPV-OL were included in this cross-sectional
study. Following informed consent, biopsies were obtained. HPV detection and
typing were carried out by PCR and sequencing (MY09/11, GP5+/6+). HPV-13 and
HPV-32 loads were determined by a high-resolution melting assay. For statistical 
analysis, X2 , Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests were applied, using SPSS 
software (v.23).
RESULTS: Twenty-nine HIV subjects (median age 38 years, 93% males) were included.
Most were AIDS individuals (72.4%) under HAART (89.7%). Twenty-two (75.9%)
participants had more than one HPV-OL (four with florid presentations), mostly
multifocal epithelial hyperplasia (62%), being HPV-13 (26%) and HPV-32 (31%) the 
most frequent types. HPV load was higher in individuals with multiple HPV-OLs
than in solitary lesions (4.9 vs. 3.2 Log10 copies/ml, p = .090) and in HPV-32+
than in HPV-13+ (8.3 vs. 6.4 Log10 copies/ml, p = .014).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple HPV-OLs showed high HPV loads, possibly indicating
transcriptional activity of the virus; however, in the HIV setting, the
individual and local immunological response could be the key process.
