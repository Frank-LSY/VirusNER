Kaposi's sarcoma is a common malignancy associated with HIV/AIDS. Herein, we
describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented with bilateral neck and
inguinal lymphadenopathy, a massive tumor on the gum, and a nodule over the left 
eye. A series of tests, including tumor biopsies, were performed, and
disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma with human herpesvirus 8 infection was diagnosed.
To test for HIV, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time
polymerase chain reaction, but the results were negative. The patient was treated
by biweekly intravenous infusion of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (25 mg/m(2)),
and this treatment resulted in a partial response.
