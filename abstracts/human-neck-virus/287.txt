OBJECTIVES: The advantages of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methodology
are quick results and the possibility of repeated analysis. The main aim of our
study was to establish the relationship of the total cfDNA with patients'
clinical characteristics and circulating HPV DNA detection in the blood of
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: The cfDNA level of 200 HNSCC patients in plasma was quantified using
TaqMan-based TERT amplification. TaqMan technology was also used for HPV16/18
detection. Additionally, mutations in KRAS and EGFR were investigated.
RESULTS: A higher level (p=0.011) of the total cfDNA was found in patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (9.60 ± 6.23 ng/ml) in comparison
with other HNSCC (7.67 ± 4.44 ng/ml). The level of cfDNA in patients with
clinical N2-N3 disease (9.28 ± 6.34 ng/ml) was (p=0.015) higher than in patients 
with a clinical N0-N1 disease (7.50 ± 3.69 ng/ml). It was also higher in patients
with stage IV (9.16 ± 6.04 ng/ml) compared with stages I-III of cancer (7.26 ±
3.63 ng/ml) (p=0.011). Analysis of HPV16/18 in plasma revealed that 14% of
patients were HPV-positive, the majority of whom had the type HPV16 (96.4%).
CfDNA level was comparable in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC patients, as
well in the OPSCC subgroup. Somatic mutations in EGFR and KRAS were not found.
CONCLUSIONS: A high level of cfDNA is specific for patients with OPSCC. HPV
detection in cfDNA does not depend on the cfDNA concentration. Our results prove 
the diagnostic potential of plasma-based HPV cfDNA tests for the early detection 
and monitoring of HPV-positive HNSCC.
