BACKGROUND: Overexpression of p16 is associated with improved outcomes among
patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma. However, its role in the outcomes of
patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) remains unclear.
METHODS: Eighty-six patients with NPC treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center from
2000 to 2014 were identified. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus
(HPV) status were determined by in situ hybridization (ISH) and p16 by
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: EBV positivity was associated with extended overall survival (OS;
median, 95.0 vs 44.9 months; p < .004), progression-free survival (PFS; median,
80.4 vs 28.1 months; p < .013), and locoregional control (median, 104.4 vs 65.5
months; p < .043). In patients with EBV-positive tumors, p16 overexpression
correlated with improved PFS (median, 106.3 vs 27.1 months; p < .02) and
locoregional control (median, 93.6 vs 64.5 months; p < .02).
CONCLUSION: P16 overexpression is associated with improved PFS and locoregional
control in patients with EBV-positive NPC. P16 expression may complement EBV
status in predicting treatment outcomes for patients with NPC. © 2015 Wiley
