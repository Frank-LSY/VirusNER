BACKGROUND: We conducted a large national cohort study to examine the risk of
cancer among men and women with genital warts (GW).
METHODS: By use of the Danish National Patient Register, we identified 16,155 men
and 32,933 women who received a diagnosis of GW during 1978-2008. Standardized
incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed as estimates of the relative risk of
specific cancers or sites.
RESULTS: A diagnosis of GW was strongly related to anal (SIR for men, 21.5; SIR
for women, 7.8), vulvar (SIR, 14.8), vaginal (SIR, 5.9), cervical (SIR, 1.5),
penile (SIR, 8.2), and head and neck cancer (SIR, 2.8), including subsites of
head and neck cancer with confirmed HPV association (SIR for men, 3.5; SIR for
women, 4.8). The risks remained elevated for >10 years following GW diagnosis. In
addition, we found moderately increased SIR estimates for nonmelanoma skin
cancer, smoking-related cancers, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GW have a long-term increased risk of anogenital
cancers and head and neck cancers. The elevated risks of nonmelanoma skin cancers
might indicate an association with HPV, while excess risks of other cancers could
point to differences in other risk factors between individuals with GW and the
general population.
