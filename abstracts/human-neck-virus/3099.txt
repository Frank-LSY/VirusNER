OBJECTIVES: 1. To retrospectively review the pathophysiology and radiologic
features of delayed facial palsy after stapedectomy. 2. To discuss the cause and 
management strategy of this unusual problem.
PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty stapedectomies performed between 2001 and 2007 by a 
single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed. Two patients in this series
developed a delayed facial palsy postoperatively.
INTERVENTIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on patients with
delayed facial palsy after stapedectomy and was repeated as their clinical
symptoms resolved. The patients were treated medically with oral corticosteroids 
and antiviral medications.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical course and radiographic characteristics on
MRI of patients with delayed facial palsy are presented.
RESULTS: Two of 450 patients who underwent stapedectomies (0.4%) during a 7-year 
period developed the rare complication of delayed facial palsy (postoperative
Days 12 and 41, respectively). Both patients experienced periauricular pain and
dysgeusia, followed by rapidly progressive complete facial nerve paralysis. The
operated ear showed no sign of infection. MRI with gadolinium of the internal
auditory canal demonstrated enhancement of the labyrinthine portion of the facial
nerve as seen in Bell's palsy. Both patients were treated with oral
corticosteroids and antiviral medications. Subsequent imaging revealed decreased 
enhancement with resolution of facial paralysis.
CONCLUSION: In the rare complication of delayed facial palsy after stapedectomy, 
MRI findings support the hypothesis that reactivation of a latent virus is the
underlying cause. Therefore, delayed facial paralysis after stapedectomy should
be treated similarly to Bell's palsy with steroid and antiviral medical therapy.
