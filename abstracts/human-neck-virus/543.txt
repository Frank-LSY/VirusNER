The correlation between p16 upregulation and high-risk HPV infection is well
known in head and neck squamous cell cancer. However, no information is available
on rare carcinomas of the minor salivary glands. We analyzed 38 samples of minor 
salivary gland malignancies. p16 expression was determined by
immunohistochemistry, HPV DNA by using in situ hybridization to detect low (type 
6 and 11) and high (type 16 and 18) risk HPV types. In 71% of samples p16
expression was found. Low-risk HPV DNA could not be detected in any of the
samples, whereas high-risk HPV DNA was found in two samples of mucoepidermoid
carcinoma, which also showed the highest immunoreactivity with p16. HPV infection
does not seem to be a common event in minor salivary gland carcinoma.
Upregulation of p16 is present in the majority of cases but only diffuse staining
correlates with HPV 16 and 18 infections.
