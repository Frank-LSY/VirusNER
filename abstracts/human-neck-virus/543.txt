HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cells had different expression of key genes. ATO inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis and these effects were more significant in HPV-positive HNSCC cells than in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. ATO treatment reduced the expression of HPV16-E6/E7 and cyclin D1 proteins and enhanced the expression of p16, pRb, and p53 in HPV-positive HNSCC cells. By contrast, ATO treatment reduced the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1 and mutant p53 and enhanced the expression of pRb in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. Anti-cancer effect of ATO on HNSCCs was confirmed by inhibiting xenograft growth in vivo.
