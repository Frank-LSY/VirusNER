Characterizing the epidemiology of head and neck cancers is challenging and has
received limited attention in the medical literature. Traditionally, 80%-90% of
head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have been attributed to tobacco
and alcohol use, but with growing public awareness and tobacco control efforts
over the past few decades, there has been a downward trend in smoking prevalence 
in the US. There is also emerging evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) is
responsible for inconsistencies in HNSCC trends, with oncogenic HPV DNA found in 
approximately half of oropharyngeal cancers and in a high proportion of
oropharyngeal cancers in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. The risk to HNSCC
epidemiology is that whatever gains continue to be made in tobacco control may
become lost in the increasing numbers of oropharyngeal cancers due to HPV. The
purpose of this review is to explore the changing epidemiology of HNSCC, focusing
on how it has been shaped by health policy and advocacy interventions and how it 
will continue to have public health implications in the future, particularly in
considering preventive strategies against HPV. Given that the majority of HNSCCs 
are the result of exposure to preventable public health risks, more focus should 
be given to this area.
