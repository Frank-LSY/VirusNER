BACKGROUND: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (HPV-positive)
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oropharynx has dramatically 
increased over the last decade and continues to rise. Newly diagnosed
HPV-positive HNSCCs in the United States currently outnumber any other
HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer. Despite introduction of the
HPV vaccine, the epidemic of HPV-positive HNSCC is expected to continue for
approximately 60 years. Compared with patients who have tobacco-associated HNSCC,
those who have HPV-positive HNSCC have better overall survival and response to
treatment. Current treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, is
associated with lifelong morbidity, and there are limited treatments and no
curative options for patients who develop recurrent metastatic disease.
Therapeutic de-escalation (decreased radiation dose) is being tested through
clinical trials; however, those studies select patients based solely on tumor and
patient smoking characteristics. Mechanisms of HPV-driven carcinogenesis in HNSCC
are not well understood, which limits new therapeutic strategies and hinders the 
appropriate selection of patients for de-escalation therapy.
METHODS: The authors analyzed HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify
molecular characteristics that correlate with outcomes and integration status of 
the HPV genome.
RESULTS: The current investigations identified a subset of HPV-positive HNSCCs
with mutations in the genes TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor 3) and CYLD (cylindromatosis lysine 63 deubiquitinase). Defects in TRAF3
and CYLD correlated with the activation of transcriptional factor nuclear factor 
κB, episomal HPV status of tumors, and improved patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Defects in TRAF3/CYLD were accompanied with the activation of
nuclear factor κB signaling and maintenance of episomal HPV in tumors, suggesting
that these mutations may support an alternative mechanism of HPV tumorigenesis in
head and neck tumors. Cancer 2017;123:1778-1790. © 2017 The Authors. Cancer
