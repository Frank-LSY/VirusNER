IL-1a, an important regulator of immune and inflammation responses, has been
implicated in cancer development and prognosis. An insertion (Ins)/deletion (Del)
polymorphism (IL-1a rs3783553) in the 3' UTR of IL-1a may disrupt a binding site 
for miRNA-122 and may affect its transcription level. Thus, this polymorphism may
cause interindividual variation in immune and inflammation responses and thus may
lead to different susceptibility to treatment response and prognosis of such
patients. We evaluated the association of IL-1a rs3783553 polymorphism with risk 
of recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) in a cohort of
1008 patients. Log-rank test and univariate and multivariable Cox models were
used to evaluate associations. Compared with patients with Del/Del homozygous
genotype, the patients with Ins/Del+Ins/Ins variant genotypes had worse
disease-free survival (log-rank P < 0.0001) and increased risk of SCCOP
recurrence (HR, 2.4, 95% CI, 1.7-3.3) after multivariable adjustment.
Furthermore, among patients with HPV16-positive tumors, the patients with
Ins/Del+Ins/Ins variant genotypes of the IL-1a polymorphism had worse
disease-free survival (log-rank P < 0.0001) and much higher recurrence risk than 
those with Del/Del homozygous genotype of this polymorphism (HR, 16.3, 95% CI,
5.0-52.7). Our findings suggest that IL-1a rs3783553 polymorphism may modulate
the risk of SCCOP recurrence in patients, particularly for patients with
HPV16-positive tumors. However, larger studies are needed to validate these
results.
