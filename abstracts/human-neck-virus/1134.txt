High-risk strains of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause nearly all cases of
cervical cancer as well as a growing number of head and neck cancers. The
oncogenicity of these viruses can be attributed to the activities of their two
primary oncoproteins, E6 and E7. The E6 protein has among its functions the
ability to prevent apoptosis of infected cells through its binding to FADD and
caspase 8. A small molecule library was screened for candidates that could
inhibit E6 binding to FADD and caspase 8. Flavonols were found to possess this
activity with the rank order of
myricetin>morin>quercetin>kaempferol=galangin≫(apigenin, 7-hydroxyflavonol,
rhamnetin, isorhamnetin, geraldol, datiscetin, fisetin, 6-hydroxyflavonol).
Counter screening, where the ability of these chosen flavonols to inhibit caspase
8 binding to itself was assessed, demonstrated that myricetin, morin and
quercetin inhibited GST-E6 and His-caspase 8 binding in a specific manner. The
structure-activity relationships suggested by these data are unique and do not
match prior reports on flavonols in the literature for a variety of anticancer
assays.
