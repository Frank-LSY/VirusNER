Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma is now recognized
as a clinically distinct subtype of head and neck cancer with important
prognostic implications. HPV testing is recommended as the standard of care for
all patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we
describe a practical approach to HPV testing within the setting of the diagnostic
histopathology laboratory.
