BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) is a growing problem that presents a significant challenge to
Otolaryngologist-Head and Neck Surgeons. Knowledge of HPV status yields critical 
prognostic information, with potential for treatment selection based on tumour
HPV status. The current gold standard of diagnosis, PCR, is expensive, demanding 
and time consuming. Alternatives such as p16 immunohistochemistry are subjective 
and potentially inaccurate. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a
rapid, robust and inexpensive molecular diagnostic technique.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to verify LAMP as a potential bedside diagnostic assay
for subtyping of HPV in OPSCC.
STUDY DESIGN: DNA from 72 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) OPSCC patient
samples was tested. PCR and LAMP were then performed to specifically identify HPV
16, 18, 31, 33 and 35.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: For these high-risk subtypes, LAMP had an overall
sensitivity of 99.4% and specificity of 93.2% relative to PCR. LAMP is a
promising technology that can accurately diagnose high-risk HPV infection.
