BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the expression pattern of 
the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) large T-protein antigen in patients with
Merkel cell carcinoma.
METHODS: A tissue microarray (TMA) containing 30 specimens was constructed and
stained for the MCPyV large T protein. Immunohistochemical expression was
determined semiquantitively and was compared to patients' outcome.
RESULTS: Nuclear expression of MCPyV large T protein was detected in 29 of 30
specimens (97%). In particular, 60% to 100%, 30% to 60%, and 10% to 30% of tumor 
cells were positive in 27 specimens (90%), 1 (3%), and 1 (3%), respectively.
There was no difference in positivity between primary and metastatic lesions.
Clinical data could not be correlated to MCPyV large T-protein expression.
CONCLUSION: MCPyV large T protein was significantly overexpressed in 97% of all
specimens. Although we could not demonstrate a predictive effect, MCPyV large T
protein may represent a molecular marker with utility in pathological diagnosis
as well as a potential new therapeutic target in patients with Merkel cell
carcinoma.
