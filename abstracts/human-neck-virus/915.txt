BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report was to present the results of accelerated 
radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant weekly cisplatin in head and neck cancer.
METHODS: One hundred six patients received concomitant cisplatin 40 mg/m(2)
weekly with accelerated RT up to a dose of 68 Gy over 5.5 weeks.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine percent of the patients received planned RT and 90% received
≥5 cycles of cisplatin. Moist desquamation of skin developed in 45% and confluent
mucositis in 82%. Feeding tubes were required in 79% of the patients, and after
12 months in 4%. One patient developed nephrotoxicity. Three-year locoregional
control, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 72%, 54%,
and 61%, respectively. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was positive on
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and p16 in 11 of 50 patients with oropharyngeal
carcinoma. Three-year OS was 81% and 66% in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative
patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) with accelerated RT was well 
tolerated and treatment compliance was high. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head
