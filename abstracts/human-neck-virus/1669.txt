OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of tumor p16 status and other clinical factors 
on the therapeutic decision-making process in patients with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study (GETTEC collaborative
study group) enrolling all OPSCC patients with a determined p16-status considered
eligible for surgery between 2009 and 2014. The impact of p16-status and other
clinical factors on the therapeutic decision was evaluated in multivariate
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 476 patients were enrolled in the study, including 244 cases 
(51%) of p16-positive OPSCC. Overall, 223 (47%) patients underwent primary
surgery, and 184 (83%) of them received postoperative
radiotherapy ± chemotherapy. More patients with p16-positive OPSCC tended to
undergo non-surgical treatment than did patients with p16-negative OPSCC
(p = 0.10). Multivariate analysis showed that 5 factors significantly influenced 
therapeutic management of the patients: T-stage ≥ 3 (towards a non-surgical
strategy; p < 0.001), N-stage ≥ 2a (non-surgical strategy; p = 0.02), tumor
involvement of the glosso-tonsillar sulcus (surgical strategy; p = 0.002), tumor 
extension to the oral cavity (surgical strategy; p < 0.009) and the center of
care (p < 0.001). The rate of patients directed towards a surgical strategy
varied between 9% and 74% depending on the center.
CONCLUSION: There was a non-significant trend to recommend patients with
p16-positive OPSCC for non-surgical treatment. Center of care, tumor stage and
tumor anatomical subsite and extensions were the main determinants of the
treatment choice.
