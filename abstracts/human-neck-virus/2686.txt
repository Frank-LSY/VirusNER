The clinical impact of the expression of NOTCH1 signaling components in squamous 
cell carcinoma of the pharynx and larynx has only been evaluated in subgroups.
The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate NOTCH1 expression in head and
neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) patient tissue and cell lines. We analyzed
tissue from 195 HNSCCs and tissue from 30 normal patients for mRNA expression of 
NOTCH1, NOTCH3, HES1, HEY1, and JAG1 using quantitative real-time PCR.
Association of expression results and clinical orpathological factors was
examined with multivariate Cox regression. NOTCH1 expression was determined in
three Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive and nine HPV-negative HNSCC cell
lines. High expression of NOTCH1 was associated with better overall survival (p =
0.013) and disease-free survival (p = 0.040). Multivariate Cox regression
confirmed the significant influence of NOTCH1 expression on overall survival (p =
0.033) and disease-free survival (p = 0.029). A significant correlation was found
between p16 staining and NOTCH1 mRNA expression (correlation coefficient 0.28; p 
= 0.01). NOTCH1 was expressed at higher levels in HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines
compared with HPV-negative cell lines, which was not statistically significant (p
= 0.068). We conclude that NOTCH1 expression is associated with overall survival,
and that inhibition of NOTCH1 therefore seems less promising.
