To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 serology as diagnostic
marker for HPV16-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), 214 HNSCC 
patients from Germany and Italy with fresh-frozen tumor tissues and sera
collected before treatment were included in this study. Hundred and twenty cancer
cases were from the oropharynx and 94 were from head and neck cancer regions
outside the oropharynx (45 oral cavity, 12 hypopharynx and 35 larynx). Serum
antibodies to early (E1, E2, E6 and E7) and late (L1) HPV16 proteins were
analyzed by multiplex serology and were compared to tumor HPV RNA status as the
gold standard. A tumor was defined as HPV-driven in the presence of HPV16 DNA and
HPV16 transformation-specific RNA transcript patterns (E6*I, E1∧ E4 and E1C). Of 
120 OPSCC, 66 (55%) were HPV16-driven. HPV16 E6 seropositivity was the best
predictor of HPV16-driven OPSCC (diagnostic accuracy 97% [95%CI 92-99%], Cohen's 
kappa 0.93 [95%CI 0.8-1.0]). Of the 66 HPV-driven OPSCC, 63 were HPV16 E6
seropositive, compared to only one (1.8%) among the 54 non-HPV-driven OPSCC,
resulting in a sensitivity of 96% (95%CI 88-98) and a specificity of 98% (95%CI
90-100). Of 94 HNSCC outside the oropharynx, six (6%) were HPV16-driven. In these
patients, HPV16 E6 seropositivity had lower sensitivity (50%, 95%CI 19-81), but
was highly specific (100%, 95%CI 96-100). In conclusion, HPV16 E6 seropositivity 
appears to be a highly reliable diagnostic marker for HPV16-driven OPSCC with
very high sensitivity and specificity, but might be less sensitive for
HPV16-driven HNSCC outside the oropharynx.
