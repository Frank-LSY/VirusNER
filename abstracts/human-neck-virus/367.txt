HPV analysis was performed on 256 head and neck carcinomas in an effort to predict clinical outcomes (56%), localize primary tumor origin (21%), establish tumor classification (9%), determine patient eligibility for vaccine trials (8%), or satisfy patient curiosity (5%). A total of 182 (71%) tumors were HPV positive. HPV positivity correlated with oropharyngeal site (82% vs 9%) and male sex (77% vs 48%). p16 positivity was present in all 176 HPV16-positive cases, and in 19 of 80 (24%) cases that were HPV-16 negative. In 6 (32%) discordant cases, p16 expression was because of the presence of another HPV type.
