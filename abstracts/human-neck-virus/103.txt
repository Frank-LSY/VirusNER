BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to screen for human papillomavirus (HPV)
infections in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) using P16
immunostaining.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 150 samples from
patients diagnosed with HNSCCs. HPV status was determined using p16INK4A.
RESULTS: 31 of the 150 (20.7%) HNSCCs were HPV positive.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of HNSCCs in Sudan are associated with HPV
infection. The fact that the prevalence of HPV is high among Sudanese patients
with head and neck cancers (HNC) has obvious implications for vaccine therapy.
