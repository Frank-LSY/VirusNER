An etiological role of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of
cervical cancer has been well established. Hence, attention of researchers has
been focused on the role of HPV in pathogenesis of other malignancies, such as
head and neck cancers. An analysis of epidemiological data on the prevalence of
HPV infection among healthy people and patients with precancerous lesions and/or 
cancer is an important step in understanding the role of HPV in head and neck
carcinogenesis. More and more data de-monstrate the impact of HPV infection on
disease outcome. HPV-positive patients have been shown to have better responses
to radiotherapy and better overall and disease-free survival than HPV-negative
patients. This review presents data of the meta-analysis based on a large number 
of original studies on HPV prevalence in patients with precancerous lesions and
in patients with oral, oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers as well as findings on
the impact of HPV infection on survival of these patients.
