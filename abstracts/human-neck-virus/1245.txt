OBJECTIVES: Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with both better and 
worse prognosis in solid tumors. As therapeutic modalities for nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) are limited, immunotherapy could be a potential alternative. Up
till now there is limited prognostic data on the role of TILs in NPC, so we
assessed the prognostic role of TILs in Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) positive and
negative NPC.
METHODS: Tissue of 92 NPCs was assessed for CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1 and PDL1
expression in the tumor's micro-environment. Correlations between
clinicopathological characteristics was assessed using the Pearson X2 test,
Fisher's exact test and ANOVA. Survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method
and Cox regression. Differences in CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1, PDL1 counts/(co)expression
between EBV positive and negative NPCs were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U
test. Two-tailed P values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: EBV positive NPC contains significantly more CD3, CD4 and CD8 TILs than 
EBV negative NPC. In the whole NPC group, increased CD8 count is associated with 
better overall survival (OS) (HR 0.219 (95%CI 0.075-0.640)), but also in cases
with PDL1 co-expression (HR 0.073 (95%CI 0.010-0.556)). In EBV positive NPC
co-expression of CD8 and PDL1 showed better disease free survival (HR 0.407
(95%CI 0.195-0.850)) and OS (HR 0.170 (95%CI 0.037-0.787)).
CONCLUSIONS: Although TILs are significantly different between EBV positive and
negative NPCs, it is especially composition of the infiltrate which determines
prognosis. Effects of PD1 and CD8 need more study, because these findings show
much potential in using immunotherapeutic modalities in NPC treatment.
