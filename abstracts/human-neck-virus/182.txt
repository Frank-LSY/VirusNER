Estimating the type-specific prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and
neck cancer (HNSCC) is helpful in predicting the impact of HPV
immunization.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall prevalence, and gender and
age-specific prevalence of HPV in HNSCC.
METHOD: This cross sectional retrospective study was carried out in four
pathology laboratories of Medellin, Colombia. HPV testing was performed by
GP5+/6+ PCR-based RLB and HPV 16 and 18 type-specific PCR.
RESULTS: 175 primary HNSCC cases consecutively diagnosed between 1999 and 2008
with confirmed diagnosis and amplifiable DNA were included. Overall HPV
prevalence was 18.9%. HPV was found in 23.9%, 17.5% and 13.3% of the oral cavity,
larynx and oropharynx cases respectively. Among HPV positive cases, 82% were HPV 
16 and 18% were HPV 18. No other HPV genotypes were identified. Most patients
were males. Male patients were younger that their female counterparts,
particularly in oral cavity cancer cases.
CONCLUSION: HPV 16 and 18 genotypes were found in nearly 20% of HNSCC cases in
Colombian patients. The impact of HPV vaccination for the prevention of HNSCC in 
this population deserves further evaluation.
