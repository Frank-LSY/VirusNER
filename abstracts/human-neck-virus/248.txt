We evaluated the risk factors associated with oral human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection and oral lesions in 161 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive
patients and 128 HIV-negative patients presenting for oral examination at 2 urban
healthcare centers. Patients were interviewed on risk factors and provided
oral-rinse samples for HPV DNA typing by polymerase chain reaction. Statistical
associations were assessed by logistic regression. Oral HPV was prevalent in 32% 
and 16% of HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative patients, respectively,
including high-risk HPV type 16 (8% and 2%, respectively; P = .049) and uncommon 
HPV types 32/42 (6% and 5%, respectively; P = .715). Among HIV-negative patients,
significant risk factors for oral HPV included multiple sex partners (≥21 vs ≤5; 
odds ratio [OR], 9.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-49.3), heavy tobacco
smoking (>20 pack-years vs none; OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.4-59.4), and marijuana use
(OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.3-12.4). Among HIV-positive patients, lower CD4(+) T-cell
count only was associated with oral HPV detection (≤200 vs ≥500 cells/mm(3); OR, 
4.5; 95% CI, 1.3-15.5). Detection of high-risk HPV was also associated with
concurrent detection of potentially cancerous oral lesions among HIV-negative
patients but not among HIV-positive patients. The observed risk factor
associations with oral HPV in HIV-negative patients are consistent with sexual
transmission and local immunity, whereas in HIV-positive patients, oral HPV
detection is strongly associated with low CD4(+) T-cell counts.
