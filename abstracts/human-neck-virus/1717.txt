OBJECTIVES: 18F-FDG PET/CT is widely used in clinical oncology. Human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)
represents an emerging disease that differs from HPV-negative OPSCC in clinical
behavior and tumour biology. In these tumours, HPV-oncogenes might lead to
distinct alterations in metabolic pathways. Therefore, we compared metabolic
parameters using 18F-FDG PET/CT in HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC in
relation to histopathological findings.
MATERIALS: Eighty-six patients with OPSCC received pre-therapeutic 18F-FDG
PET/CT. Standardised uptake volume (SUV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and
metabolic tumour volume (MTV) were analysed for the primary tumour. SUVmax was
determined for neck lymph nodes. HPV-status was determined; overall survival
rates (OS) were estimated.
RESULTS: 32/86 patients (37.2%) had HPV-related OPSCC. Overall, PET-parameters in
primary tumours of both groups did not differ significantly. Comparing early with
locally advanced primary tumours, there was a significant increase in 18F-FDG
uptake in HPV-negative patients (p<0.001). Positive nodes of HPV-related OPSCC
showed significantly higher SUVmax values (p=0.039) compared to HPV-negative
OPSCC. Strikingly, there was a higher intraindividual homogeneity of 18F-FDG
uptake between primary and respective positive nodes in HPV-related primary OPSCC
(p=0.001). SUV-max and -mean values did not correlate with OS in HPV-related
OPSCC.
CONCLUSION: The intraindividual homogeneity of 18F-FDG uptake in HPV-related
OPSCC could reflect the more homogenously, HPV-triggered carcinogenesis compared 
to the mutation-driven carcinogenesis in the HPV-negative OPSCC with heterogenic 
18F-FDG uptake.
