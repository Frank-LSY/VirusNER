Interviewed by Ellen Clarke, Commissioning Editor, Future Science Group. Robert
Coffin is co-founder and CEO of Replimune. Previously he was Founder and CTO of
BioVex Inc, a spin out from his research group at University College London in
1999. He was the inventor of all BioVex products including OncoVEXGM-CSF
(talimogene laherparepvec; T-VEC; Imlygic) and oversaw all research and clinical
