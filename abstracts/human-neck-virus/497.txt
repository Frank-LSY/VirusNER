The OS of all patients was 60.1%. In univariate analysis, LNR was a significant predictor of overall survival rate (P=.008) in OPSCC independently of the HPV status, as well as extracapsular spread (ECS). T-classification was only a significant predictor in the univariate analysis in HPV-positive OPSCC carcinoma. However, in the multivariate analysis LNR remained predictor of prognosis in all OPSCC and in HPV-negative OPSCC. In patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, only T-classification reached significance to predict OS.
