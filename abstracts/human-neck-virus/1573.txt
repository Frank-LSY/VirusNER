In human cancer, molecular markers combined with clinical characteristics are
used increasingly to predict prognosis. Prostate tumor overexpressed-1 (PTOV1),
first identified in prostate cancer, is a key factor in tumor progression and
correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes. HPV infection status was tested by
HPV E6-targeted multiplex real-time PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses were used to examine the mRNA and
protein expression levels of PTOV1 in eight paired LSCC samples. IHC was
performed to assess PTOV1 protein expression in 196 paraffin-embedded, archived
LSCC samples. PTOV1 protein and mRNA expression was increased in LSCC tissues
compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. High expression of PTOV1was 
significantly associated with advanced TNM stage by the Ï‡2 test. Multivariate
analysis revealed that PTOV1 and HPV status were independent prognostic
indicators of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P =
0.001, P = 0.009 for OS, P = 0.005, P = 0.012 for PFS, respectively). Our study
provides the first evidence that the combination of PTOV1 expression level and
HPV status provides more prognostic information compared with HPV status alone
with the significance still exists in the HPV negative subgroup.
