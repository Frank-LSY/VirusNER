STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Herpes labialis infections are common and present a
serious risk to the dental team.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:   The purpose is to make dentists aware of the risks
involved with treatment of patients with active herpes labialis. In addition,
evidence-based risk-management strategies are presented.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The incidence and natural history of herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (HSV-1) are reviewed. Four previously unreported case histories are
presented to illustrate the impact common sequelae of HSV-1 can have on the
dental team. The differences between HSV-1 and the blood-borne diseases which are
the focus of universal precautions are discussed. In particular, the highly
contagious, highly transmissible nature of HSV-1 and its transmission through
aerosols are highlighted. Finally, the need to include protection against
aerosols in the profession's understanding of universal precautions is noted.
RESULTS: The authors suggest limiting the treatment of patients with active
lesions to urgent care only, and treating active HSV-1 lesions to reduce time of 
healing. For four common clinical situations involving HSV-1 infections,
evidence-based methods for protecting the dental team and the patient from
cross-contamination are also presented.
CONCLUSION: While it is clear that the treatment of patients with active herpes
labialis lesions increases risk of cross-infection, there are good protocols for 
controlling this risk.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: By bringing common vectors of cross-infection to light and
providing evidence-based protocols for preventing them, this article provides
practitioners with positive steps that can be taken for controlling the risk of
spreading herpes infections to the dental team.
