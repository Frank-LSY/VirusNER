OBJECTIVES: Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important risk
factor for development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Strikingly, HPV-positive HNSCCs have a more favorable prognosis than their
HPV-negative counterparts. The current study was designed to explain this
favorable prognosis of HPV-positive HNSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was performed by investigating the response of four
HPV-positive and fourteen HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines to cisplatin, cetuximab
and radiation.
RESULTS: Analysis of the responses of this cell line panel indicated that
HPV-positive cells are more resistant to cisplatin treatment than the
HPV-negative HNSCCs, whereas the response to radiation and cetuximab did not
differ.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that the favorable prognosis for patients
with HPV-positive HNSCC does not seem to be related to an intrinsic sensitivity
of these tumor cells to chemotherapy or radiation in vitro.
