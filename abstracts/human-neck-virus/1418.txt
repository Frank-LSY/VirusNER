BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is staged using the TNM
system. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumors have improved prognosis,
despite presenting at advanced stage. Optimal treatment and stratification of
HPV-positive patients are not clearly defined.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 266 patients with oropharyngeal SCC for
mortality and feeding tube dependency related to TNM stage, HPV status, and
treatment.
RESULTS: TNM staging was prognostic in HPV-negative patients (stage III/IV hazard
ratio [HR], 2.00; p = .05; N(+) HR, 2.19; p = .02). Only T classification was
prognostic in HPV-positive tumors (T3/T4 HR 3.31; p = .006). HPV-positive tumors 
showed improved survival regardless of treatment. Patients receiving chemotherapy
had a significantly increased risk of feeding tube dependency (odds ratio [OR],
1.72; p = .03).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the current TNM system has little prognostic 
value in HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC. Patients with HPV-positive tumors show
improved survival independent of treatment. The addition of chemotherapy
increases the risk of feeding tube dependency and could potentially be avoided in
T1/T2 HPV-positive tumors without compromising survival.
