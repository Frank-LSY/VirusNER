We present a case of a 62-year-old man who underwent total hip arthroplasty for
treatment of pathologic femoral neck fracture associated with adefovir
dipivoxil-induced osteomalacia. He had a 13-month history of bone pain involving 
his shoulders, hips, and knee. He received adefovir dipivoxil for treatment of
lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus infection for 5â€‰years before the
occurrence of femoral neck fracture. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of
osteomalacia and pathological hip fracture caused by drug-induced renal
dysfunction, which results in Fanconi's syndrome.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual
