OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has a
more favorable prognosis when compared to HPV-negative disease, regardless of the
presence of nodal metastases. However, the importance of contralateral neck
treatment based on HPV status has not been well studied. Given the historically
poor prognostic implications of cervical nodal metastases, this study sought to
elucidate the relationship between HPV status and contralateral/bilateral nodal
metastasis in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
METHODS: Data were collected on patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma from 2001 to 2014. Nodal status was determined by contrast-enhanced
computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or surgical pathology when
available. Survival rates and associations between HPV status and
demographic/tumor characteristics were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 178 total patients, 46 (26.0%) had contralateral/bilateral
metastases. There was no significant difference in incidence of
contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases between HPV-positive and HPV-negative
patients (24.6% vs. 29.1%, P = .53). Tonsil primaries had significantly lower
incidence of contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases compared to tongue base
(20.9% vs. 34.3%, P = .048). On multivariate regression, tumor size was the only 
factor associated with contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases (T4 vs. T1-3 odds
ratio = 5.15, 95% confidence interval: 2.4-11.2). Five-year overall survival
among all patients with and without contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases was 
45.4% and 65.2%, respectively (P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not show a significantly different incidence of
contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases between HPV-positive and HPV-negative
patients. T4 stage and tongue base location, however, were associated with
contralateral disease. These data suggest treatment of bilateral necks might be
warranted in these cases, regardless of HPV status.
