OBJECTIVES: The incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) continues to increase, particularly
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases. The inactivation of the p53 
tumor suppressor gene promotes a chain of molecular events, including cell cycle 
progression and apoptosis resistance. Reactivation of wild-type p53 function is
an intriguing therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether a novel compound derived from diterpene triepoxide (Minnelide™) can
reactivate wild-type p53 function in HPV-positive HNSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For all of our in vitro experiments, we used 2
HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines, University of Michigan squamous cell carcinoma
(UM-SCC) 47 and 93-VU-147, and 2 HPV-positive human cervical cancer cell lines,
SiHa and CaSki. Cells were treated with different concentrations of triptolide
and analyzed for p53 activation. Mice bearing UM-SCC 47 subcutaneous xenografts
and HPV-positive patient-derived tumor xenografts were treated with Minnelide and
evaluated for tumor growth and p53 activation.
RESULTS: In HPV-positive HNSCC, Minnelide reactivated p53 by suppressing E6
oncoprotein. Activation of apoptosis followed, both in vitro and in vivo. In 2
preclinical HNSCC animal models (a subcutaneous xenograft model and a
patient-derived tumor xenograft model), Minnelide reactivated p53 function and
significantly decreased tumor progression and tumor volume.
CONCLUSION: Triptolide and Minnelide caused cell death in vitro and in vivo in
HPV-positive HNSCC by reactivating wild-type p53 and thus inducing apoptosis. In 
addition, in 2 HPV-positive HNSCC animal models, Minnelide decreased tumor
progression and induced apoptosis.
