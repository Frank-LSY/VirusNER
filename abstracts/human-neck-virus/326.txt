On September 18, 2014, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services
(MDHSS) was notified of a suspected rabies case in a Missouri resident. The
patient, a man aged 52 years, lived in a rural, deeply wooded area, and bat
sightings in and around his home were anecdotally reported. Exposure to bats
poses a risk for rabies. After two emergency department visits for severe neck
pain, paresthesia in the left arm, upper body tremors, and anxiety, he was
hospitalized on September 13 for encephalitis of unknown etiology. On September
24, he received a diagnosis of rabies and on September 26, he died. Genetic
sequencing tests confirmed infection with a rabies virus variant associated with 
tricolored bats. Health care providers need to maintain a high index of clinical 
suspicion for rabies in patients who have unexplained, rapidly progressive
encephalitis, and adhere to recommended infection control practices when
examining and treating patients with suspected infectious diseases.
