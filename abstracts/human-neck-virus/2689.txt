The aim of this study was to assess the association between HIV infection and
cancer risk in Rwanda approximately a decade after the introduction of
antiretroviral therapy (cART). All persons seeking cancer care at Butaro Cancer
Center of Excellence (BCCOE) in Rwanda from 2012 to 2016 were routinely screened 
for HIV, prior to being confirmed with or without cancer (cases and controls,
respectively). Cases were coded according to ICD-O-3 and converted to ICD10.
Associations between individual cancer types and HIV were estimated using
adjusted unconditional logistic regression. 2,656 cases and 1,196 controls
differed by gender (80.3% vs. 70.8% female), age (mean 45.5 vs. 37.7 years),
place of residence and proportion of diagnoses made by histopathology (87.5% vs. 
67.4%). After adjustment for these variables, HIV was significantly associated
with Kaposi Sarcoma (n = 60; OR = 110.3, 95%CI 46.8-259.6), non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL) (n = 265; OR = 2.5, 1.4-4.6), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (n = 76; OR = 5.2,
2.3-11.6) and cancers of the cervix (n = 560; OR = 5.9, 3.8-9.2), vulva (n = 23; 
OR = 17.8, 6.3-50.1), penis (n = 29; OR = 8.3, 2.5-27.4) and eye (n = 17;
OR = 4.7, 1.0-25.0). Associations varied by NHL/HL subtype, with that for NHL
being limited to DLBCL (n = 56; OR = 6.6, 3.1-14.1), particularly plasmablastic
lymphoma (n = 6, OR = 106, 12.1-921). No significant associations were seen with 
other commonly diagnosed cancers, including female breast cancer (n = 559), head 
and neck (n = 116) and colorectal cancer (n = 106). In conclusion, in the era of 
cART in Rwanda, HIV is associated with increased risk of a range of
infection-related cancers, and accounts for an important fraction of cancers
presenting to a referral hospital.
