OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess differences in morphological
and glycolytic characteristics of primary tumors and locoregional nodal disease
between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 123 baseline FDG PET/CT scans from 
patients (aged 57.0 ± 10.6 years) with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal SCC between 
January 2003 and June 2012. There were 98 HPV-positive and 25 HPV-negative
patients. SUVmax, SUVpeak, and SUVmean based on lean body mass, as well as RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) dimensions, metabolic tumor volume
(gradient and threshold-segmentation methods) and total lesion glycolysis, were
determined for primary and locoregional nodal disease.
RESULTS: Human papillomavirus-negative primary tumors were significantly larger
as measured by RECIST longest diameter (P = 0.002) and slightly more
heterogeneous as measured by the heterogeneity index (P = 0.07), higher SUVmax (P
< 0.01), SUVpeak (P = 0.01), SUVmean (P = 0.01), metabolic tumor volume (P =
0.002), and total lesion glycolysis (P = 0.001), for both segmentation methods.
Index parameters of HPV-positive nodal disease tend to be larger, but some with
no statistical significance (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in
the metabolic parameters of primary tumor or nodal metastases for HPV-positive
patients with and without smoking history.
CONCLUSIONS: Index morphologic and glycolytic parameters as measured in FDG
PET/CT are significantly larger in HPV-negative as compared with HPV-positive
primary oropharyngeal carcinoma. In contrast, the same parameters trended to be
larger in HPV-positive regional nodal disease.
