BACKGROUND: There is a dramatic rise in the incidence of Human papillomavirus
(HPV) - associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in the world,
with considerable variation by geography, gender and ethnicity. Little is known
about the situation in Bangladesh, where tobacco- and areca nut-related head and 
neck cancers (HNCs) are the most common cancers in men. We aimed to determine the
prevalence of HPV in HNSCC in Bangladesh and to explore the possible value of
cell cycle markers in clinical diagnostic settings.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety six archival HNSCC tissue samples were analysed
for the presence of HPV DNA. The DNA quality was assured, and then amplified
using a nested PCR approach. The typing of HPV was performed by automated DNA
sequencing. Cellular markers p53, Cyclin D1 and pRb were tested on all samples by
immunohistochemistry (IHC), as well as p16 as a putative surrogate for the
detection of HPV.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 36/174 (~21%) samples: 36% of cancers from the
oropharynx; 31% of oral cancers, and 22% from the larynx. HPV-16 was most common,
being present in 33 samples, followed by HPV-33 (2 samples) and HPV-31 (1
sample). Twenty-eight out of 174 samples were positive for p16, predominantly in 
HPV-positive tissues (p < 0.001). No statistically significant association was
observed between the cellular markers and HPV DNA positive cases. However, p16
positivity had excellent predictive value for the presence of HPV by PCR.
CONCLUSION: There is a significant burden of HPV-associated HNSCC in Bangladesh, 
particularly in the oropharynx but also in oral and laryngeal cancers. Whilst a
combination of PCR-based DNA detection and p16 IHC is useful, the latter has
excellent specificity, acceptable sensitivity and good predictive value for
carriage of HPV in this population and should be used for prognostic evaluation
and treatment planning of all HNSCC patients in South Asia, as in the Western
world.
