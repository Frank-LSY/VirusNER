BACKGROUND: Serum immunoglobulin A antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgA) and early antigen (EA-IgA), are used to screen for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in endemic areas. However, their routine use has
been questioned because of a lack of specificity. This study aimed to determine
the distributions of different subtypes of antibody and to illustrate how the
natural variation patterns affect the specificity of screening in non-NPC
participants.
METHODS: The distribution of baseline VCA-IgA was analyzed between sexes and
across 10-year age groups in 18,286 non-NPC participants using Chi square tests. 
Fluctuations in the VCA-IgA level were assessed in 1056 non-NPC participants with
at least two retests in the first 5-year period (1987-1992) after the initial
screening using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The titers of VCA-IgA increased with age (P < 0.001). Using a previous
serological definition of high NPC risk, nasopharyngeal endoscopy and/or
nasopharyngeal biopsy would be recommended in 55.5% of the non-NPC participants
with an initial VCA-IgA-positive status and in 20.6% with an initial negative
status during the 5-year follow-up. However, seroconversions were common; 85.2%
of the participants with a VCA-IgA-positive status at baseline converted to
negative, and all VCA-IgA-negative participants changed to positive at least once
during the 5-year follow-up. The EA-IgA status had a high seroconversion
probability (100%) from positive to negative; however, it had a low probability
(19.6%) from negative to positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Age- and sex-specific cutoff titer values for serum anti-EBV
antibodies as well as their specific titer fluctuation patterns should be
considered when defining high NPC risk criteria for follow-up diagnostics and
monitoring.
