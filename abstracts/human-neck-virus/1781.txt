OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection and pathogenesis of nasal inverted papilloma (NIP) and its malignant
transformation.
METHOD: Fifty-seven cases of NIP were divided into 2 groups: benign group,
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arising in NIP group (malignancy group). HPV-DNA
types of 6, 11, 16, 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 57
cases of NIP. Thirty cases of nasal polyps were control.
RESULT: Total positive rate of HPV in NIP was 64.9% (37/57). The positive rate of
benign group was 60% (27/45), all with single and low risk HPV11 type infection. 
The positive rate of malignancy group were was 83.3% (10/12), and the majority
were HPV16 and HPV18. Five cases had double infection (4 with HPV16 and HPV 18, 1
with HPV11 and HPV18), four had single HPV16 infection, another one had single
HPV11 infection. However, HPV-DNA was not detected in any cases of nasal polyps.
CONCLUSION: Infection of HPV-DNA has an important effect in pathogenesis of NIP. 
Meanwhile, there maybe a close relationship between high risk HPV16 type and
HPV18 type and malignant transformation of NIP.
