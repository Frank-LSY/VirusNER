OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Assess tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) functional mutations in
the context of other biomarkers in advanced larynx cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective analysis of pretreatment tumor TP53, human
papillomavirus (HPV), Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1 status in stage III and IV larynx
cancer patients in a clinical trial.
METHODS: TP53 exons 4 through 9 from 58 tumors were sequenced. Mutations were
grouped using three classifications based on their expected function. Each
functional group was analyzed for response to induction chemotherapy, time to
surgery, survival, HPV status, p16INK4a, Bcl-xl, and cyclin D1 expression.
RESULTS: TP53 mutations were found in 22 of 58 (37.9%) patients with advanced
larynx cancer, including missense mutations in 13 of 58 (22.4%) patients,
nonsense mutations in four of 58 (6.9%), and deletions in five of 58 (8.6%).
High-risk HPV was found in 20 of 52 (38.5%) tumors. A classification based on
Evolutionary Action score of p53 (EAp53) distinguished missense mutations with
high risk for decreased survival from low-risk mutations (P = 0.0315). A model
including this TP53 classification, HPV status, cyclin D1, and Bcl-xL staining
significantly predicts survival (P = 0.0017).
CONCLUSION: EAp53 functional classification of TP53 mutants and biomarkers
predict survival in advanced larynx cancer.
