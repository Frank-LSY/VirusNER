BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is implicated as an aetiological
factor in head and neck squamous carcinomas (HNSCC), especially in the tonsils of
the oropharyngeal region. This study investigates the frequency of HPV infection,
p16 and p53 tumour profile and mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), Kirsten RNA Associated Rat Sarcoma 2 Virus (KRAS) and B-Raf
proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (BRAF) genes in tonsillar and
non-tonsillar HNSCCs and correlates with clinical outcome and histopathological
parameters in previously unstudied cohort of patients.
METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was performed utilising the demographic
data and pathological specimens from 60 out of 726 head and neck cancer patients.
Smoking and alcohol history, tumour staging, treatment and outcomes were
recorded. Histopathology and immunochemistry for p16 and p53 was performed and
HPV DNA was detected with polymerase chain reaction. Genomic DNA from all cancers
were analysed for somatic mutations of EGFR, BRAF and KRAS genes.
RESULTS: 20 (33%) of 60 cases were tonsillar squamous carcinomas and 38 (66%)
were non-tonsillar. 19 (95%) of the 20 tonsillar cancers and three (8%) of 38
non-tonsillar patients were patients who were HPV 16-positive. Nine (47%) of the 
19 HPV 16-positive tonsillar cases were p16 positive. Gene mutations were rare.
There was a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improved survival of patients
with HPV positive tonsillar tumours, younger age and non-smokers.
CONCLUSION: Although limited in numbers, this study reinforces the role of HPV
infection in HNSCC and its association with a more favourable clinical course in 
younger non-smokers worldwide. Gene mutation frequencies were low in all cancers 
tested and routine testing not recommended.
