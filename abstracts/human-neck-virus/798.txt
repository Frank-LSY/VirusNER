Bell's palsy is unilateral, acute onset facial paralysis that is a common
condition. One in every 65 people experiences Bell's palsy in the course of their
lifetime. The majority of patients afflicted with this idiopathic disorder
recover facial function. Initial treatment involves oral corticosteroids,
possible antiviral drugs, and protection of the eye from desiccation. A small
subset of patients may be left with incomplete recovery, synkinesis, facial
contracture, or hemifacial spasm. A combination of medical and surgical treatment
options exist to treat the long-term sequelae of Bell's palsy.
