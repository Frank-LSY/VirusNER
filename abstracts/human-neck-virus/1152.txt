BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed how human papilloma virus (HPV) infection 
in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) affects the outcome of surgical 
therapy; furthermore, the relationship between the presence of HPV DNA and neck
lymph node (LN) metastasis has not been well established.
METHODS: A total of 65 patients who underwent surgery as a first-line therapy for
OPSCC were enrolled in this study. In HPV-positive patients, the presence of HPV 
DNA in metastatic neck LN lesions was evaluated.
RESULTS: The HPV-positive patients had significantly better overall survival than
the HPV-negative patients (log-rank test, p = 0.04), whereas HPV infection status
did not significantly affect disease-free survival (log-rank test, p = 0.65). In 
all of the HPV-positive OPSCC patients who developed cervical LN metastasis, the 
same HPV DNA type was found in both the primary tumour and the metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that HPV infection is a determining
factor for good prognosis in patients undergoing first-line surgical therapy for 
OPSCC.
