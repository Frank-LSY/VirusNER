Cervical cancer is a major public health problem and one of the leading causes of
cancer deaths in women. Virtually all cases of cervical cancer, as well as a
growing share of anal and head/neck tumors, are associated with human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Despite the effectiveness, the available
prophylactic vaccines do not benefit women with cervical lesions or cancer.
Therefore, the search of new immunotherapeutic approaches to treat HPV-induced
tumors is still a priority. The present study characterizes a therapeutic
antitumor vaccine based on the genetic fusion of the Herpes simplex virus-1
(HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) with the E7 oncoprotein from HPV-16 (gDE7). Two
subcutaneous doses of gDE7, admixed with poly (I:C), conferred complete and
long-lasting therapeutic antitumor protection on mice previously challenged with 
tumor cells expressing the HPV-16 oncoproteins. The vaccine induced
multifunctional E7-specific CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic activity and effector
memory phenotype (CD44+ CD62Llow). In addition, gDE7 admixed with poly (I:C)
vaccination controlled the expansion of tumor-induced regulatory T cells and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells. More importantly, gDE7 activated mouse CD11c+
CD8α+ and human BDCA3+ dendritic cells (DC), specialized in antigen
cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells, under in vitro conditions. These results
indicated that the activation of a specific DC population, mediated by gD,
improved the antigen-specific immune responses and the therapeutic performance
induced by antitumor vaccines. These results open perspectives for the clinical
testing of gDE7-based vaccines under the concept of active immunization as a tool
for the therapeutic control of cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(9); 1922-33. ©2017
