The most common diagnosis rendered with head and neck fine needle aspiration
(FNA) biopsy is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While most cases of
metastatic SCC pose little diagnostic difficulty, the diagnosis of metastatic
histologic variants of SCC, often coupled with less common etiologies, can be
more problematic. This manuscript reviews the clinicopathologic features of the
histologic variants of upper aerodigestive tract SCC (verrucous, papillary,
spindle cell, undifferentiated, acantholytic, and basaloid) and uncommon
etiologies of head and neck SCC (human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, and
NUT midline carcinomas). Particular attention is paid to the cytologic features
of these lesions. Differential diagnoses and the use of ancillary testing are
discussed.
