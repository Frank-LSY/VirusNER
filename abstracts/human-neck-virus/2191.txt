CONCLUSION: The current study confirmed the significant high mobility group box 1
(HMGB1) was promoted in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues by
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, in association with the malignant status of
NPC, and promoted the proliferation NPC cells RAGE-dependently.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was to examine the association of HMGB1
over-expression in human NPC with the EBV-positivity and to determine the
regulatory role of HMGB1 on the proliferation of NPC cells in vitro.
METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blotting were utilized to examine the HMGB1
expression. EBV infection in CNE-2 cells was performed to investigate the HMGB1
promotion by EBV infection. RNA interference technology was utilized for the RAGE
knockout.
RESULTS: It was demonstrated that HMGB1 was significantly higher in both mRNA and
protein levels in the EBV-positive NPC tissues, in marked association with the
malignant status of NPC, and with the LMP1 DNA level in EBV-positive NPC samples.
In addition, the MTT assay, growth curve, and the colony forming assay confirmed 
the promotion by HMGB1 to the proliferation of CNE-2 cells, depending on RAGE.
