Cystic fibrosis (CF) pigs spontaneously develop sinus and lung disease resembling
human CF. The CF pig presents a unique opportunity to use gene transfer to test
hypotheses to further understand the pathogenesis of CF sinus disease. In this
study, we investigated the ion transport defect in the CF sinus and found that CF
porcine sinus epithelia lack cyclic AMP (cAMP)-stimulated anion transport. We
asked whether we could restore CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR)
current in the porcine CF sinus epithelia by gene transfer. We quantified CFTR
transduction using an adenovirus expressing CFTR and green fluorescent protein
(GFP). We found that as little as 7% of transduced cells restored 6% of CFTR
current with 17-28% of transduced cells increasing CFTR current to 50% of non-CF 
levels. We also found that we could overcorrect cAMP-mediated current in non-CF
epithelia. Our findings indicate that CF porcine sinus epithelia lack anion
transport, and a relatively small number of cells expressing CFTR are required to
rescue the ion transport phenotype. These studies support the use of the CF pig
as a preclinical model for future gene therapy trials in CF sinusitis.
