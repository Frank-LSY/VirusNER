PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of induction chemotherapy and chemo-IMRT in
head and neck squamous cell cancers at risk of bilateral nodal spread (midline
tumours) and to evaluate whether bilateral superficial lobe parotid-sparing IMRT 
can reduce the incidence of ⩾G2 subjective xerostomia.
METHODS: Patients with midline tumours were enrolled to a phase II trial to
receive induction platinum/5-fluorouracil and concomitant platinum with combined 
superficial lobe parotid-sparing IMRT. The primary site and involved nodal levels
received 65 Gy in 30 fractions (f) and at risk nodal levels, 54 Gy/30f. Incidence
of ⩾G2 subjective xerostomia was defined as the primary endpoint. Secondary
endpoints included incidences of acute and late toxicities and survival outcomes 
dependent on human papilloma virus (HPV) status.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients with midline cancers completed treatment
between December 2005 and May 2010 with median follow-up of 50 months. Incidences
of ⩾G2 acute toxicities were: dysphagia 75%; xerostomia 65%; mucositis 86%; pain 
83%; and fatigue 64%. At 12 months, ⩾G2 subjective xerostomia was observed in 21%
(17% in HPV +ve). Two-year loco-regional progression-free survival (PFS) was
90.7% (95% CI: 85.2-96.2). According to HPV status, there was a significant
difference for 2-year loco-regional PFS, 76.8% (HPV-negative) vs 98.6%
(HPV-positive), P=0.001. 2-year overall survival was 93% for HPV-positive
compared with 52% for HPV-negative cases, P<0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential chemotherapy/chemo-IMRT for midline tumours is feasible, 
with excellent survival outcomes. At 1 year, 21% experience ⩾G2 subjective
xerostomia. Two-year survival outcomes differ significantly between HPV-positive 
and HPV-negative disease, suggesting development of different treatment schedules
for the different disease entities.
