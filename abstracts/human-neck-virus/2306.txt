BACKGROUND: Treatment for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has changed
toward a more oncologic approach. We evaluated treatment of the neck, the
incidence of regional recurrences, and factors associated with regional
recurrence during the treatment approach transition period in patients with
regional lymph node metastasis.
METHODS: All patients with oropharyngeal SCC diagnosed at the Helsinki University
Hospital during 2000-2009 were analyzed for clinicopathological factors,
treatment, p16 expression, and regional recurrence.
RESULTS: Altogether, 169 patients had a complete response, and among them
regional recurrence occurred in 5 patients (4.7%) treated with surgery ±
radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and in 2 patients (3.2%) treated
with RT or CRT ± surgery. All these 7 patients had N2b disease or higher, and 5
of them had regional recurrence in the contralateral side of the neck.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of regional recurrence was low, and remained unchanged 
despite the increased use of RT or CRT ± surgery. Treatment and follow-up of the 
contralateral neck warrants special attention in patients with advanced neck
disease (≥N2b).
