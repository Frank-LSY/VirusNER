Past treatment efforts for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have emphasized
treatment intensification that increased local-regional control rates with an
increased risk of late (swallowing) complications. With the improved survival
demonstrated for human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal carcinomas,
strategies offering comparable outcomes but with fewer complications are needed. 
Radiotherapy dose reduction has been postulated to reduce the risk of late
complications and is an active area of investigation. Alternative strategies may 
include the use of transoral surgery offering selective use of adjuvant therapy. 
This article summarizes the contributing risk factors of late swallowing
complications and the strategies for risk reduction.
