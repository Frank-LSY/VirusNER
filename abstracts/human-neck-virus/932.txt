BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is mainly associated with 
human papillomavirus (HPV)6 or HPV11. The purpose of this study was to compare
clinical outcome, aggressiveness, and treatment response between HPV6- and
HPV11-associated RRP.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 55 patients with RRP (1974-2012) was used.
Surgical interventions (n = 814) were analyzed, and complications scored.
HPV6/11-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on RRP biopsies.
RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of patients (42 of 55) were infected with HPV6 and
24% (13 of 55) with HPV11. The HPV11 group had anatomically more widespread
disease. The expected number of surgical interventions was higher in the younger 
age (<22.4 years) HPV11 group, and the older age (<22.4 years) HPV6 group.
Regardless of HPV type, earlier age of onset of RRP resulted in a higher number
of surgical interventions.
CONCLUSION: Anatomically, HPV11-associated RRP behaves more aggressively. Younger
patients with HPV11 and older patients with HPV6 experience a worse clinical
course of RRP.
