BACKGROUND: In the past few years, eleven new human viruses have joined the two
previously known members JCPyV and BKPyV of the Polyomaviridae family, by virtue 
of molecular methods. Serology data suggest that infections with human
polyomaviruses (HPyVs) occur since childhood and the viruses are widespread in
the general population. However, the viral persistence sites and transmission
routes are by and large unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that the four 
new HPyVs - KIPyV, WUPyV, MCPyV and TSPyV - were present in the tonsils, and
suggested lymphoid tissue as a persistent site of these emerging human viruses.
We developed a Luminex-based multiplex assay for simultaneous detection of all 13
HPyVs known, and explored their occurrence in tonsillar tissues of children and
adults mostly with tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy.
METHODS: We set up and validated a new Luminex-based multiplex assay by using
primer pairs and probes targeting the respective HPyV viral protein 1 (VP1)
genes. With this assay we tested 78 tonsillar tissues for DNAs of 13 HPyVs.
RESULTS: The multiplex assay allowed for simultaneous detection of 13 HPyVs with 
high analytical sensitivity and specificity, with detection limits of 100-102
copies per microliter, and identified correctly all 13 target sequences with no
cross reactions. HPyV DNA altogether was found in 14 (17.9%) of 78 tonsils. The
most prevalent HPyVs were HPyV6 (7.7%), TSPyV (3.8%) and WUPyV (3.8%). Mixed
infection of two HPyVs occurred in one sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The Luminex-based HPyV multiplex assay appears highly suitable for
clinical diagnostic purposes and large-scale epidemiological studies. Additional 
evidence was acquired that the lymphoid system plays a role in HPyV infection and
persistence. Thereby, shedding from this site during reactivation might take part
in transmission of the newly found HPyVs.
