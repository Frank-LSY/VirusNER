Of the 85 subjects identified to have laryngeal papillomatosis, 24(28%) demonstrated laryngeal dysplasia. There was good interrater agreement on the presence of dysplasia; however, there was only fair agreement on the grade of dysplasia. Of the pathology specimens tested for HPV subtype, the majority of patients (62%) were positive for HPV 6/11, including all high-grade dysplasia patients. Three (12%) dysplasia specimens were negative for both high- and low-risk HPV subtypes.
