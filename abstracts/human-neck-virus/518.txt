Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a heterogeneous group of viruses classified into five genera. The beta-HPV type (beta-PV) infection is very common but mostly asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, beta-PVs play a role in Epidermodysplasia verruciformis and possibly in non-melanoma skin cancer. Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a common cancer type worldwide and high-risk alpha-PV involvement in HNC has been extensively studied but beta-PV types have rarely been the focus of such studies.
