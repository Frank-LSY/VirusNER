Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays an important role in a host's defense against human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. IL-10 promoter variants may affect its expression
level or functional efficiency and, subsequently, susceptibility to and survival 
of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx (SCCOP). We determined 
tumor HPV16 DNA and genotyped three IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in 309 incident 
patients with SCCOP. Compared with the patients with corresponding common
homozygous genotypes, patients carrying variant genotypes of IL-10 rs1800871 and 
rs1800872 were ~2.5 times more likely to have HPV16(+) tumors among patients with
SCCOP. Among HPV16(+) patients with SCCOP only, compared to those with the
corresponding variant genotypes, the patients with IL-10 rs1800871 and rs1800872 
CC genotypes had significantly better survival and ~70-80% reduced risk of
death/recurrence after multivariable adjustment. Additionally, functional
relevance of these variants was characterized to explore the genotype-phenotype
correlation. Our findings indicate that IL-10 genetic variants may be associated 
with tumor HPV16(+) SCCOP and predict survival of HPV16(+) patients with SCCOP.
Larger studies are needed to validate our findings.
