Acute isolated velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a clinical entity mainly
reported in children. We undertook a systematic review in order to better
characterize its features. Following a Medline search (1960-2012), the authors
reviewed and analyzed the cases of acute VPI in children; 36 cases were found.
The most common presenting features were hypernasal speech (97 %), nasal reflux
(73 %), and dysphagia (49 %). 73 % of the children were males and 27 % females,
of 8.9 Â± 2.5 years. In all the cases the VPI was unilateral. One quarter of the
children had a recent episode of febrile illness and 11 % of the children had an 
identified infection at the time of presentation (HAV, parvovirus B19, measles,
and Coxsackie virus). No associated cause was found in the other cases. All cases
resolved completely (67 %) or partially (33 %) without any treatment (89 %) or
with prednisolone (11 %). Acute VPI represents a separate entity within the
spectrum of VPI and it is a benign self-limiting disorder. The cause remains
undetermined but an infectious disorder may play a role at least in some cases.
Follow-up is mandatory in order to eliminate progressive conditions such as
brainstem neoplasms or inflammatory diseases.
