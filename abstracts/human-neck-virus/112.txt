BACKGROUND: Viral gene therapy is a promising new treatment modality for head and
neck cancer. This paper provides the reader with a review of the relevant
literature in this field.
RESULTS: There are government licensed viral gene therapy products currently in
use for head and neck cancer, utilised in conjunction with established treatment 
modalities. The viruses target tumour-associated genes, with the first licensed
virus replacing p53 gene function, which is frequently lost in tumourigenesis.
Oncolytic viruses selectively destroy cancer cells through viral replication and 
can be armed with therapeutic transgenes.
CONCLUSION: Despite considerable advances in this field over the last 40 years,
further research is needed to improve the overall efficacy of the viruses and
allow their widespread utilisation in the management of head and neck cancer.
