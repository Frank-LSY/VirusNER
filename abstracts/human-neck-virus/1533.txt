Castleman's disease (CD) is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder. The
association of human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) and human immunodeficiency virus
infections with CD is well established however the role of Epstein-Barr Virus in 
CD is less well understood. We present a unique case of Castleman's disease in a 
patient with concomitant EBV infection, which mimicked the clinical presentation 
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) versus lymphoma. After a delayed diagnosis, the
patient underwent a left superficial parotidectomy and neck dissection and has
had no recurrence of disease.
