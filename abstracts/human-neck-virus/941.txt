We present a novel finding of the bullfrog neck in 3 patients with classic features of HIV lipodystrophy. The dysmorphic features of HIV lipodystrophy present a significant therapeutic challenge because the current repertoire of treatments is only modestly effective, and the disease in patients who continue HAART regimens over the long term will progress. Review of the recent literature suggests that the individual protease inhibitors and NRTIs used may play a role in the development and progression of HIV lipodystrophy.
