Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are over-expressed in nearly all cancers. To
study novel regulatory factors of MMP expression in head and neck cancer (HNC),
we screened a total of 636 candidate genes encoding putative human transmembrane 
proteins using MMP promoter reporter in a dual luciferase assay system. Three
genes GPR65, AXL and TNFRSF10B dramatically activated the induction of MMP3
expression. The induction of MMP expression by GPR65 was further confirmed in
A549 and/or FaDu cells. GPR65 mediated MMP induction under acidic conditions. The
AP-1 binding site in MMP3 promoter was crucial for MMP3 induction. Moreover, the 
A549 cells infected by recombinant adenovirus of GPR65 showed accelerated cell
invasion. In conclusion, we validate that GPR65 is vital regulatory genes
upstream of MMP3, and define a novel mechanism of MMP3 regulation by
proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors.
