BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a challenging disease with a
high mortality rate. Natural products represent a valuable source for the
development of novel anticancer drugs. We investigated the cytotoxic potential of
essential oil from the leaves of a medicinal plant, Levisticum officinale
(lovage) on head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (HNSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of lovage essential oil was investigated on
the HNSCC cell line, UMSCC1. Additionally, we performed pharmacogenomics
analyses.
RESULTS: Lovage essential oil extract had an IC₅₀ value of 292.6 μg/ml. Genes
involved in apoptosis, cancer, cellular growth and cell cycle regulation were the
most prominently affected in microarray analyses. The three pathways to be most
significantly regulated were extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5)
signaling, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling, virus entry via endocytic
pathways and p53 signaling.
CONCLUSION: Levisticum officinale essential oil inhibits human HNSCC cell growth.
