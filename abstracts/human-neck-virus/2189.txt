INTRODUCTION: Immunological response to human papillomavirus (HPV) in the
development and progression of HPV16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) (accounting for the majority of viral associated cases) is largely
unknown and may provide important insights for new therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: In this prospective clinical trial (UKCRN11945), we examined
cell-mediated immune responses to HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 in peripheral blood using
IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. CD56+, CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory T 
cell frequencies were also discerned by flow cytometry. Fifty-one study
participants with oropharyngeal carcinoma were recruited. Control subjects were
those undergoing tonsillectomy for benign disease. All patients were treated with
curative intent by radiotherapy ± chemotherapy. Disease-specific survival was
investigated by multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: HPV16 DNA was detected in 41/51 of the OPSCC participants. T cell
responses against HPV16 E6 or E7 peptides were detected in 33/51 evaluable
patients, respectively and correlated with HPV status. Matched pre- and
post-treatment T cell responses were available for 39/51 OPSCC cases. Within the 
whole cohort, elevated post-treatment CD8+ response to HPV16 E7 correlated with
longer disease free survival (multivariate DFS p < 0.03). Within the HPV + OPSCC 
cohort, a significant increase in regulatory T cells (p < 0.02) was noted after
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide survival data in OPSCC stratified
by cell-mediated immune response to HPV16 peptides. Within the HPV16+ OPSCC
cohort, enhanced immunoreactivity to antigen E7 was linked to improved survival. 
An increase in regulatory T cell frequencies after treatment may suggest that
immunosuppression can contribute to a reduced HPV-specific cell-mediated
response.
