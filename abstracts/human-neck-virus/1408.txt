OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence of viruses and bacteria in middle ear and
adenoids of patients with and without otitis media with effusion (OME).
METHODS: Adenoid samples and middle ear washes (MEW) were obtained from children 
with OME associated with adenoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy and
tympanostomy, and compared to those obtained from patients undergoing cochlear
implant surgery, as a control group. Specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses
(rhinovirus, influenza virus, picornavirus, syncytial respiratory virus,
metapneumovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) and 5
bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and S.
aureus) were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: 37 OME and 14 cochlear implant children were included in the study. At
the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both OME and control
patients. At the middle ear washes, however, a higher prevalence of bacteria was 
observed in patients with OME (p = 0.01). S. pneumoniae (p = 0.01) and M.
catarrhalis (p = 0.022) were the bacteria responsible for this difference.
Although total virus detection was not statistically different from controls at
the middle ear washes (p = 0.065), adenovirus was detected in higher proportions 
in adenoid samples of OME patients than controls (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite both OME and control patients presented similar rates of
viruses and bacteria at the adenoid, children with OME presented higher
prevalence of S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis in middle ear and adenovirus in
adenoids when compared to controls. These findings could suggest that these
pathogens could contribute to the fluid persistence in the middle ear.
