PURPOSE: A major limitation of studies reporting a lower prevalence rate of human
papilloma virus (HPV) in African American patients with oropharyngeal squamous
cell cancer (OPSCC) than Caucasian Americans, with corresponding worse outcomes, 
was adequate representation of HPV-positive African American patients. This study
examined survival outcomes in HPV-positive and HPV-negative African Americans
with OPSCC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study cohort of 121 patients with primary OPSCC had 42% 
African Americans. Variables of interest included age, race, gender, HPV status, 
stage, marital status, smoking, treatment, and date of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Caucasian Americans are more likely to be HPV positive (OR = 3.28; P =
0.035), as are younger age (age < 50 OR = 7.14; P = 0.023 compared with age > 65)
or being married (OR = 3.44; P = 0.016). HPV positivity and being unmarried were 
associated with being late stage (OR = 3.10; P = 0.047 and OR = 3.23; P = 0.038, 
respectively). HPV-negative patients had 2.7 times the risk of death as
HPV-positive patients (P = 0.004). Overall, the HPV-race groups differed
(log-rank P < 0.001), with significantly worse survival for HPV-negative African 
Americans versus (i) HPV-positive African Americans (HR = 3.44; P = 0.0012); (ii)
HPV-positive Caucasian Americans (HR = 3.11; P = < 0.049); and (iii) HPV-negative
Caucasian Americans (HR = 2.21; P = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV has a substantial impact on overall survival in African American
patients with OPSCC. Among African American patients with OPSCC, HPV-positive
patients had better survival than HPV negative. HPV-negative African Americans
also did worse than both HPV-positive Caucasian Americans and HPV-negative
Caucasian Americans. This study adds to the mounting evidence of HPV as a
racially linked sexual behavior life style risk factor impacting survival
outcomes for both African American and Caucasian American patients with OPSCC.
