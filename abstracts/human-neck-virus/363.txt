The oropharynx has a crucial role in swallowing because of the surrounding constrictor musculature, need for mobility and pliability, and proximity of the base of tongue to the larynx. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection as a cause of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has increased dramatically in proportion and overall numbers of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases. Better clinical response to therapy and younger age of the HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients have caused functional and quality-of-life considerations to become more important endpoints in evaluating efficacy of therapeutic options; "deintensification" to ameliorate toxicity is under investigation for this population.
