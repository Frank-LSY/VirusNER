BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the prevalence of the human papilloma virus
(HPV) in oropharyngeal tumours (OpSCC) is important because HPV-positive OpSCC
are consistently associated with an improved overall survival. Recently, an
algorithm has become available that reliably detects clinically relevant HPV in
tumour tissue, however, no complete cohorts have been tested. The aim was to
determine the prevalence of active high-risk HPV infection in a complete cohort
of OpSCC collected over a 16-year period.
METHODS: Using a triple algorithm of p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV-BRISH and
HPV-PCR, we assessed the prevalence of active HPV infection in all OpSCC
diagnosed in our hospital from 1997 to 2012 (n=193) and a random selection of 200
oral tumours (OSCC).
RESULTS: Forty-seven OpSCC (24%) were HPVGP PCR-positive; 42 cases were HPV16+, 1
HPV18+, 3 HPV33+ and 1 HPV35+. Brightfield in situ hybridisation did not identify
additional HPV-positive cases. Human papilloma virus-associated tumour proportion
increased from 13% (1997-2004) to 30% (2005-2012). Human papilloma
virus-positivity was an independent predictor for longer disease-specific
survival (HR=0.22; 95%CI:0.10-0.47). Only one OSCC was HPV+.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the incidence of HPV-associated OpSCC is low but
increasing rapidly. The strict detection algorithm, analysis of disease-specific 
survival and the complete cohort, including palliatively treated patients, may
influence the reported prevalence and prognostic value of HPV in OpSCC.
