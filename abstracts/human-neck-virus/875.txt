Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause approximately 5% of cancer cases worldwide.
Fortunately, three prophylactic vaccines have been approved to protect against
HPV infections. Gardasil-9, the most recent HPV vaccine, is predicted to offer
protection against the HPV types that cause ∼90% of cervical cancer, 86% of
HPV-associated penile cancers, and ∼93% of HPV-associated head & neck cancers. As
an alternative to Gardasil-9, we developed and tested a novel candidate vaccine
targeting conserved epitopes in the HPV minor capsid protein, L2. We displayed a 
tandem HPV31/16L2 peptide (amino acid 17-31) or consensus peptides from HPV L2
(amino acid 69-86 or 108-122) on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 virus-like
particles (VLPs). Mice immunized with the MS2 VLPs displaying the tandem peptide 
or immunized with a mixture of VLPs (displaying the tandem peptide and consensus 
peptide 69-86) elicited high titer antibodies against individual L2 epitopes.
Moreover, vaccinated mice were protected from cervicovaginal infection with HPV
pseudoviruses 16, 31, 45, 58 and sera from immunized mice neutralized HPV
pseudoviruses 18 and 33 at levels similar to mice immunized with Gardasil-9.
These results suggest that immunization with a tandem, L2 peptide or a low
valency mixture of L2 peptide-displaying VLPs can provide broad protection
against multiple HPV types.
