Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tonsillar- and base of tongue cancer is
increasing epidemically and has much better outcome than corresponding
HPV-negative cancer and most other head and neck cancers with around 80% 3-year
disease free survival with conventional radiotherapy and surgery. Consequently,
most HPV-positive cancer patients may not require the intensified
chemoradiotherapy given to many head and neck cancer patients and would, with
tapered treatment, avoid several severe side-effects. Moreover, intensified
therapy has not improved survival and treatment alternatives are needed. To
identify patients eligible for tapered or targeted therapy, additional biomarkers
are required. Several studies have, therefore, focused on finding predictive
markers, some of which are also potentially targetable. To conclude,
better-tailored therapy, either as tapered or targeted, is important for
increasing numbers of patients with HPV-positive tonsillar- and base of tongue
cancer. This review deals with some of these issues and presents some promising
markers.
