OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis with an HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer includes unique
social issues. However, it is unknown how common these psychosocial issues are
for patients and whether they continue after treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologically confirmed HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC, n=48) were recruited from two medical centers.
Participants completed a computer assisted self interview that explored their
psychosocial experiences during and after treatment. We examined responses
overall and by age.
RESULTS: The majority of participants with confirmed HPV-OPC, reported being told
that HPV could have (90%) or did cause (77%) their malignancy, but only 52%
believed that HPV was the main cause of their OPC. Participants over 65years were
less likely than younger participants to report that their doctors told them
their tumor was HPV-positive (50% vs 84%, p=0.03). Anxiety that their tumor was
HPV-related was a major issue among participants when first diagnosed (93%).
However, only 17% still reported anxiety after treatment was complete. While many
patients reported that providers discussed the emotional effects of diagnosis and
treatment adequately (58%), almost half reported discussing these emotional
effects inadequately (24%), or not at all (18%). Further, 18% reported that their
families still wondered about some questions that they had never asked.
CONCLUSION: After treatment, some HPV-OPC patients remain concerned about HPV and
have unanswered questions about HPV. Older patients had lower awareness of the
role of HPV in their cancer.
