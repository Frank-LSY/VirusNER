Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) is a primary target for controlling
tumorigenesis in Epstein-Barr virus related malignancies; in this study, we aimed
to develop a specific antibody against the TES1 domain of the oncogenic LMP1. We 
screened a full human na√Øve Fab phage library against TES1 peptide, which
consisted of C terminal-activating regions proximal 44 amino acids. After three
rounds of panning, enrichment and testing by phage ELISA and further analyzed by 
DNA sequencing, we selected a phage clone with the highest affinity to LMP1-TES1 
and designated it as htesFab. The positive clone was expressed in Escherichia
coli and the purified htesFab was characterized for its binding specificity and
affinity to LMP1. ELISA, immunofluorescence and FACS analysis confirmed that
htesFab could recognize LMP1 TES1 both in vitro and in LMP1 expressing HNE2-LMP1 
cells. Furthermore, MTT assay showed that htesFab inhibited the proliferation of 
HNE2-LMP1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reported the
isolation and characterization of human Fab, which specifically targets the C
terminal region/TES1 of LMP1, and has potential to be developed as novel tool for
the diagnosis and therapy of Epstein-Barr virus related carcinoma.
