Langerhans cells (LCs) are the antigen-presenting cells of the epithelial layer
and are responsible for initiating immune responses against skin and
mucosa-invading viruses. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated suppression of LC
function is a crucial mechanism of HPV immune evasion, which can lead to
persistent infection and development of several human cancers, including
cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers. The cell-derived cytokine-based
biologic, IRX-2, consists of multiple well-defined cytokines and is broadly
active on various immune cell subsets. In this study, we investigated primary
human LC activation after exposure to HPV16, followed by treatment with IRX-2 in 
vitro, and evaluated their subsequent ability to induce HPV16-specific T cells.
In contrast to its activity on dendritic cells, HPV16 alone is not sufficient to 
induce phenotypic and functional activation of LCs. However, IRX-2 induces a
significant upregulation of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules, T
helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokine release, and chemokine-directed migration of
LCs pre-exposed to HPV16. Furthermore, LCs treated with IRX-2 after HPV16
exposure induced CD8(+) T-cell responses against specific HLA-A*0201-binding
HPV16 T-cell epitopes. The present study suggests that IRX-2 is an attractive
immunomodulator for assisting the immune response in eradication of HPV-infected 
cells, thereby potentially preventing HPV-induced cancers.
