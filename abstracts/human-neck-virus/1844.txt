PURPOSE: We have used a genome-wide approach to identify novel differentially
methylated CpG dinucleotides that are seen in different anatomic sites of head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as well as those that might be related 
to HPV status in the oropharynx.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of
primary tumor samples and corresponding adjacent mucosa from 118 HNSCC patients
undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, using the Illumina 
HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured
differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M-value).
RESULTS: When datasets were individually analyzed by anatomic site of the primary
tumor, we identified 293 differentially methylated CpG loci in oral cavity
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 219 differentially methylated CpG loci in
laryngeal SCC, and 460 differentially methylated in oropharyngeal SCC. A subset
of these differentially methylated CpG loci was common across all anatomic sites 
of HNSCC. Stratification by HPV status revealed a significantly higher number of 
differentially methylated CpG loci in HPV+ patients.
CONCLUSION: Novel epigenetic biomarkers derived from clinical HNSCC specimens can
be used as molecular classifiers of this disease, revealing many new avenues of
investigation for this disease.
