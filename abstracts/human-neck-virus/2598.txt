PURPOSE: While methods for imaging tumor hypoxia with positron emission
tomography (PET) have been developed, optimal methods for interpreting and
utilizing these datasets in the clinic remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed
hypoxia PET images of head and neck cancer patients and compared imaging metrics 
with human papilloma virus (HPV) status and clinical outcome.
METHODS: Forty-one patients treated as part of a phase III trial of the hypoxic
cytotoxin tirapazamine (TROG 02.02) were imaged with PET using fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG) and fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA). FDG and FAZA PET images were
interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively, and compared with tumor T stage,
HPV status, and treatment outcome using multivariate statistics.
RESULTS: PET signals in the tumor and lymph nodes exhibited significant intra-
and inter-patient variability. The FAZA hypoxic volume demonstrated a significant
correlation with tumor T stage. PET-hypoxic tumors treated with cisplatin
exhibited significantly worse treatment outcomes relative to PET-oxic tumors or
PET-hypoxic tumors treated with tirapazamine.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of FAZA PET yielded metrics that correlated
with clinical T stage and were capable of stratifying patient outcome. These
results encourage further development of this technology, with particular
emphasis on establishment of robust quantitative methods.
