This article discusses risk factors, incidence trends, and prognostic
considerations for head and neck cancer (HNC). The primary causes of HNC are
tobacco and alcohol use, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Tobacco-related HNC
incidence rates are decreasing in countries where tobacco use has declined.
HPV-HNC, which occurs primarily in the oropharynx and is associated with sexual
behaviors, has been increasing over the past several decades, among white men in 
particular. The prognosis for HNC overall has improved slightly since the 1990s, 
and is influenced by site, stage, and HPV status. Prognosis for HPV-HNC is
significantly better than for HPV-negative disease.
