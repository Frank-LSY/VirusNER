Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small circular DNA-virus and the high-risk types 
16, 18 is implicated in oncogenesis of head and neck cancer--especially
oropharynx (tonsil and base of tongue), poorly differentiated (the basaloid
type), locoregional advanced stage, poorly differentiated, at the younger male,
non-smokers, non-drinkers, sexual behaviors. The prognostic is favorable of human
papillomavirus tumor status for patients with oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma 
treated with radiotherapy (accelerated fractionation without total dose
reduction). The impact of HPV-vaccination (ACIP 2007) decreasing the incidence of
oropharyngeal cancer, but that patients HPV-positive, have good prognostic in
generally (two-year overall survival: 95%, two-year progression-free survival:
88%), therefore HPV-vaccination in routine practice it is controversy.
