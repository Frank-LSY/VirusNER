Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection of the head and neck region may present
with various clinical symptoms, involving different entities and different routes
of viral spreading. We present a case of VZV infection of the pharynx and larynx 
with multiple cranial nerve (CN) neuropathies (CN VII, VIII, IX, and X) of a
52-year-old woman who complained of the sudden onset of hoarseness, odynophagia, 
dysphagia, and hearing loss in the left ear, followed by left-side facial
weakness lasting for 1 week. Endoscopic examination revealed multiple mucosal
erosions over the oropharynx, with extension upward to the nasopharynx and
downward to the mucosa overlying the epiglottis, arytenoid, and vocal cord. All
of these lesions tended to lateralize to the left side, suggesting a VZV
infection diagnosis; this was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction on
eruptional exudates, as well as serologic examination.
