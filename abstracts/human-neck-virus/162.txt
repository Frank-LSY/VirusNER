A 69-year-old man with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis presented with fever. 
He tested positive for the QuantiFERON TB-2G and human T-cell lymphotropic virus 
type 1 antibodies. Imaging revealed a mass in the neck of the gallbladder, with
periportal lymph node enlargement and penetration into the duodenum. A definite
diagnosis could not be made, even with a subsequent detailed examination.
Finally, cholecystectomy and a lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathology
revealed a caseating granuloma in the lymph nodes and in the serosa of the
gallbladder, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for tuberculosis.
Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with abdominal tuberculosis lymphadenitis
extending into the gallbladder and duodenum.
