OBJECTIVE: To analyze the infection of human papillomavirus in lip squamous cell 
carcinoma patients.
METHODS: The pathological samples of 9 clinical diagnosed lip cancer patients
were collected. Lunimex and PCR techniques were used to detect the HPV gene
infection and immunohistochemistry method was used to analyze the HPV protein
expression in the samples.
RESULTS: In the 9 cases, 1 was positive for HPV16 gene and 7 were positive for
HPV16/18 E6 protein expression. The total positive rate was about 8/9.
CONCLUSION: The high HPV infection rate in lip cancer patients in the study
indicated indirectly that the importance of the direct contact to the infection
of HPV what was the basis for pathogenesis of the lip squamous cell carcinoma.
