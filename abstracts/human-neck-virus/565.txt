Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can lead to development of cancer of the head and neck and anogenital regions. G-rich sequences found in genomes of high-risk HPVs can fold into non-canonical secondary structures that could serve as 3D motifs distinct from double-stranded DNA and present recognition sites for ligands and opportunity for gene expression modulation.
