PURPOSE: This study explores whether gender, age and race differences in oral
sexual behavior account for the demographic distribution of oral human
papillomavirus infection (HPV) and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OSCC).
METHODS: This analysis included 2,116 men and 2,140 women from NHANES (2009-10)
who answered a behavioral questionnaire and provided an oral-rinse sample for HPV
detection. Weighted prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios (PR) were
calculated for sexual behaviors and oral HPV infection by gender, age-cohort
(20-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60-69), and race, and contrasted with incidence rate ratios
(IRR) of OSCC from SEER 2009. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
evaluate predictors of oral sexual behavior and oral HPV16 infection.
RESULTS: Differences in oral sexual behavior were observed by gender, age-cohort 
and race. Most men (85.4%) and women (83.2%) had ever performed oral sex, but men
had more lifetime oral and vaginal sexual partners and higher oral HPV16
prevalence than women (each p<0.001). 60-69 year olds (yo) were less likely than 
45-59 or 30-44 (yo) to have performed oral sex (72.7%, 84.8%, and 90.3%,
p<0.001), although oral HPV16 prevalence was similar. Prevalence ratios (PR) of
ever oral sex in men vs. women (PR = 1.03), and 45-59 vs. 30-44 year-old men (PR 
= 0.96) were modest relative to ratios for oral HPV16 infection (PRs = 1.3-6.8)
and OSCC (IRR = 4.7-8.1). In multivariate analysis, gender, age-cohort, and race 
were significant predictors of oral sexual behavior. Oral sexual behavior was the
primary predictor of oral HPV16 infection; once this behavior was adjusted for,
age-cohort and race were no longer associated with oral HPV16.
CONCLUSION: There are differences in oral sexual behaviors when considering
gender, age-cohort and race which explain observed epidemiologic differences in
oral HPV16 infection across these groups.
