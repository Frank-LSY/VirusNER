Seven established ATC cell lines were infected with a panel of poxviruses to identify which virus had the most potential as an oncolytic agent. These included myxoma, vaccinia, and tanapox viruses, all modified to express green fluorescence protein (GFP). Viral proliferation was assessed by fluorescence and viral amplification. The effect on cell line growth was assessed by the Presto Blue metabolic assay and a live-dead assay. A replication assay was performed to assess the production of infectious progeny. An additional five ATC cell lines were tested using the assays described above for susceptibility to vaccinia virus.
