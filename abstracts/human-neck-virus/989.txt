BACKGROUND: Infection with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is
associated with penile cancer in men, cervical cancer in women, and anal cancer
and certain types of head and neck cancers in both sexes. Few studies have
assessed the prevalence and type distribution of HPV among men in sub-Saharan
Africa, where the rates of HIV and penile and cervical cancer are high.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study among 1813 men in
Tanzania. Penile samples were tested using Hybrid Capture 2, and genotyping was
done by the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra test. Blood samples were tested for
HIV. The overall and type-specific prevalence and 95% confidence interval of HPV 
was estimated in relation to age and HIV status.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV was 20.5% (95% confidence interval,
18.7-22.4), the most prevalent HR HPV types being HPV52, HPV51, HPV16, HPV18,
HPV35, and HPV66. The HR HPV prevalence was significantly higher in HIV-positive 
men (25.7%) than in HIV-negative men (15.8%; P = 0.0027). The prevalence of
HPV16, HPV18 and multiple HR HPVs tended to be higher among HIV-positive men
(statistically nonsignificant), whereas no differences were observed for the
other HPV types.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of HPV types 52, 51, 16, 18, 35, and 66. 
This information is of relevance in the understanding of HPV type distributions
across populations. Although the prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 was slightly
higher among HIV-positive men, our results indicate that HIV status does not
strongly influence the distribution of HPV types. Therefore, the currently
available HPV vaccines could prevent HPV infection independently of HIV status.
