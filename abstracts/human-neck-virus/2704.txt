Although the usual perspective on return to play for athletes is recovery from
injury, an unheralded aspect on return to play involves potentially contagious
skin infections. An estimated 8.5% of health conditions and injuries related to
high school sports and 21% of health conditions and injuries related to college
sports involve infectious diseases of the skin. In about half of these cases, the
head, face, or neck is affected. The infectious agents are common microorganisms,
including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus and
Streptococcus bacteria, herpes viruses, and tinea fungi. The challenge for
physicians is to provide proper treatment to patients within the return-to-play
guidelines of a sport's governing body, resulting in rapid resolution of the
condition, minimization of time spent out of the sport, and minimization of
communicable spread of the disease.
