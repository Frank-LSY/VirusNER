BACKGROUND: Replication-selective tumor-specific viruses present a novel approach
for treatment of neoplastic disease. They are designed to induce lysis after
propagation within the tumor. Human telomerase is active in over 85% of primary
cancers and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) expression.
OBJECTIVES: Oncolytic viruses, Telomelysin and TelomeScan, that combine the
specificity of hTERT promoter-based expression systems with the lytic efficacy of
replicative viruses were developed. The goal was to confirm the efficacy of the
viruses for human squamous cell carcinoma.
RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is
characterized by locoregional spread, and is clinically accessible, making it an 
attractive target for intratumoral virotherapy. The viruses replicated
efficiently and induced killing in a panel of human cancer cell lines including
SCCHN cells in vitro and in vivo. These results illustrate the potential of
telomerase-specific oncolytic viruses for treatment of human SCCHN.
