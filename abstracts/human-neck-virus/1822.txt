Due to its frequent overexpression in a variety of solid tumors the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-established target for therapeutic
interventions in epithelial cancers. In order to target EGFR in head and neck
cancer, we have generated a ribonuclease (RNase) fusion protein comprising a
humanized anti-EGFR antibody single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) and Ranpirnase, an
RNase from Rana pipiens. Fusion of Ranpirnase to the N-terminus of the scFv via a
flexible glycine-serine linker (G4S)3 resulted in very poor cytotoxicity of the
fusion protein. As endosomal accumulation and lysosomal degradation have been
reported to diminish the antitumor efficacy of ribonuclease or toxin-based
immunoagents, we explored a fusion peptide from dengue virus that has been
reported to be involved in the endosomal escape of the virus. This peptide was
introduced as a linker between Ranpirnase and the scFv moiety. The modified
immunoRNase exhibited exceptionally high cytotoxicity toward EGFR-expressing head
and neck cell lines without affecting specificity. These results indicate that
endosomal entrapment needs to be considered for Ranpirnase-based immunoagents and
might be overcome by the use of tailored transduction domains from viral
proteins.
