BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the main cause of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC), also found in other head and neck carcinomas (HNSCCs) where its 
role remains controversial.
RESULTS: EBV was found in 80% and 21% of the samples with PCR and ISH (in cancer 
cells), respectively. Eight of ISH-positive samples were not NPCs. EBER-RNA
detection in carcinoma cells was associated with worse prognosis, whether or not 
NPCs were included. HPV/EBV and HSV/HPV coinfections associated with a shorter
survival. LMP-1 expression, positive in 51% of samples did not correlate with the
disease outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed EBV in 73 HNSCC samples with a known HPV and
HSV-1 status, using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
for EBV-early transcripts (EBER) and LMP-1 protein, respectively. EBV-DNA was
detected with a Luminex-based method. The results were correlated with HPV-status
and disease outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV is transcriptionally active in NPC cells but also in a subgroup 
of other HNSCCs.
