A 53 year-old male gynecologist presented with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16
positive tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. He had no identifiable risk factors
with the exception of long term occupational exposure to laser plumes, having
performed laser ablations and loop electrosurgical excision procedures (LEEP) on 
greater than 3000 dysplastic cervical and vulvar lesions over 20 years of
practice. The second patient is a 62 year old male gynecologist with a 30 year
history of laser ablation and LEEP who subsequently developed HPV 16 positive
base of tongue cancer. He also had very few other risk factors for oropharyngeal 
cancer or HPV infection. HPV is a probable causative agent for oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma and has been reported as being transmittable through
laser plume. This paper suggests that HPV transmitted through laser plume can
result in subsequent squamous cell carcinoma.
