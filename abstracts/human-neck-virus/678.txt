Cidofovir is an antiviral agent used in the therapy of recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis (RRP). In this study, we hypothesized that cidofovir is effective 
in decreasing the viral load of human papillomavirus (HPV). We established a type
specific real-time PCR and measured HPV DNA loads. The course of viral load of
HPV types 6 and 11 after repeated applications of cidofovir intralesionally was
compared to the clinical outcome using a modified Derkay score. In 6 of the 8 (75
%) patients, we detected HPV 6. In 2 (25 %) patients, we detected HPV 11. In all 
of the patients, the viral load and the modified Derkay score decreased
significantly during the treatment. We conclude that viral load of HPV can be
monitored using the technique described here. Cidofovir in combination with
surgical debulking reduces the viral load in patients with RRP. Relapses of the
symptoms cannot be avoided but might be delayed.
