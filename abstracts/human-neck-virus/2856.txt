Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded Latent Membrane Protein 2A (LMP2A) is an EBV
latency-associated protein regularly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
In B cells, LMP2A activity resembles that of a constitutively activated antigen
receptor, which recruits the Syk tyrosine kinase to activate a set of downstream 
signaling pathways. LMP2A also downregulates cellular Syk levels. In the present 
study, we demonstrate that Syk interacts with the integrin β4 subunit (ITGβ4) of 
integrin α6β4 in epithelial cells and that concurrent LMP2A expression interferes
with this interaction by competitive binding to Syk. We find that both Syk and
LMP2A have an effect on ITGβ4 cell surface expression. However, in LMP2A
expressing cells, ITGβ4 remains concentrated at the cellular protrusions, an
expression pattern characteristic of motile cells, including NPC-derived
epithelial cells. This effect of LMP2A on ITGβ4 localization is associated with a
greater propensity for migration and invasion in-vitro, and may contribute to the
invasive property of LMP2A-expressing NPC.
