BACKGROUND: Because of the current epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), a screening strategy is urgently needed. The presence
of serum antibodies to HPV-16 early (E) antigens is associated with an increased 
risk for OPC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
of antibodies to a panel of HPV-16 E antigens in screening for OPC.
METHODS: This case-control study included 378 patients with OPC, 153 patients
with nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancer (non-OPC), and 782 healthy control
subjects. The tumor HPV status was determined with p16 immunohistochemistry and
HPV in situ hybridization. HPV-16 E antibody levels in serum were identified with
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A trained binary logistic regression model 
based on the combination of all E antigens was predefined and applied to the data
set. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for distinguishing HPV-related 
OPC from controls were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to
calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association of head
and neck cancer with the antibody status.
RESULTS: Of the 378 patients with OPC, 348 had p16-positive OPC. HPV-16 E
antibody levels were significantly higher among patients with p16-positive OPC
but not among patients with non-OPC or among controls. Serology showed high
sensitivity and specificity for HPV-related OPC (binary classifier: 83%
sensitivity and 99% specificity for p16-positive OPC).
CONCLUSIONS: A trained binary classification algorithm that incorporates
information about multiple E antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity and 
may be advantageous for risk stratification in future screening trials. Cancer
