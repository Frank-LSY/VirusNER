The viral-transforming proteins E6 and E7 make human papillomavirus-positive
(HPV+) malignancies an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However,
therapeutic vaccination exerts limited efficacy in the setting of advanced
disease. We designed a strategy to induce substantial specific immune responses
against multiple epitopes of E6 and E7 proteins based on an attenuated transgene 
from HPV serotypes 16 and 18 that is incorporated into MG1-Maraba virotherapy
(MG1-E6E7). Mutations introduced to the transgene abrogate the ability of E6 and 
E7 to perturb p53 and retinoblastoma, respectively, while maintaining the ability
to invoke tumor-specific, multifunctional CD8+ T-cell responses. Boosting with
MG1-E6E7 significantly increased the magnitude of T-cell responses compared with 
mice treated with a priming vaccine alone (greater than 50 × 106 E7-specific CD8+
T cells per mouse was observed, representing a 39-fold mean increase in boosted
animals). MG1-E6E7 vaccination in the HPV+ murine model TC1 clears large tumors
in a CD8+-dependent manner and results in durable immunologic memory. MG1-Maraba 
can acutely alter the tumor microenvironment in vivo and exploit molecular
hallmarks of HPV+ cancer, as demonstrated by marked infection of HPV+ patient
tumor biopsies and is, therefore, ideally suited as an oncolytic treatment
against clinical HPV+ cancer. This approach has the potential to be directly
translatable to human clinical oncology to tackle a variety of HPV-associated
neoplasms that cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. Cancer Immunol
