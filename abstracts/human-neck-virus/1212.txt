BACKGROUND: Alteration of chromosome 9q22.3 region is an early and frequent event
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this study was to
understand the association of candidate tumor suppressor genes PHF2, FANCC,
PTCH1, and XPA located in this region in the development of HNSCC.
METHODS: The alterations (deletion, promoter methylation, mutation, expression)
of these genes were analyzed in 65 dysplastic head and neck lesions and 84
primary HNSCC samples. Clinicopathologic correlations were made with alterations 
of the genes.
RESULTS: Overall alterations (deletion, promoter methylation) of FANCC and PTCH1 
were high in mild dysplasia and comparable in subsequent stages of tumor
progression. However, PHF2 alteration was low in mild dysplasia, but increased in
moderate and severe dysplasias. Alterations (deletion, promoter methylation) of
FANCC and PTCH1 showed association with each other. Two novel mutations in GLI
binding sites of PTCH1 promoter and a novel microsatellite marker hmPTCH1 with
four alleles at immediate upstream of the gene were identified. In a case-control
study, the (CGG)7 allele of hmPTCH1 was found to be susceptible for HNSCC
development. Concordance was seen in the expression (RNA, protein) of these genes
with their molecular alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of FANCC and PTCH1 could be used as molecular marker for
early diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC.
