Parvovirus B19 (B19V) DNA persists lifelong in human tissues, but the cell type
harbouring it remains unclear. We here explore B19V DNA distribution in B, T and 
monocyte cell lineages of recently excised tonsillar tissues from 77 individuals 
with an age range of 2-69 years. We show that B19V DNA is most frequent and
abundant among B cells, and within them we find a B19V genotype that vanished
from circulation >40 years ago. Since re-infection or re-activation are unlikely 
with this virus type, this finding supports the maintenance of pathogen-specific 
humoral immune responses as a consequence of B-cell long-term survival rather
than continuous replenishment of the memory pool. Moreover, we demonstrate the
mechanism of B19V internalization to be antibody dependent in two B-cell lines as
well as in ex vivo isolated tonsillar B cells. This study provides direct
evidence for a cell type accountable for B19V DNA tissue persistence.
