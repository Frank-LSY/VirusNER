Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated head and neck 
cancer that is most common in eastern Asia. Epstein-Barr virus infection,
environmental factors, and genetic susceptibility play important roles in NPC
pathogenesis. Jab1/CSN5 is a multifunctional protein that participates in
affecting integrin signaling, controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis, and
regulating genomic instability and DNA repair. Correlation of Jab1/CSN5
overexpression with poor prognosis for NPC provides evidence that it is involved 
in the tumorigenic process. In this review, we highlight recent advances in
studies of the oncogenic role of Jab1/CSN5 in NPC and its potential as a
therapeutic target for this cancer.
