BACKGROUND: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with unknown primary 
head and neck cancer who underwent a transoral laser microsurgery (TLM)-assisted 
search for an occult tumor.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients at a single center with unknown primaries of squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) were treated with a surgical algorithm.
RESULTS: The overall rate of primary tumor identification was 75% (39 of 52
patients). When selecting those cases in which a TLM algorithm with lingual
tonsillectomy was utilized, the detection rate was 86% (31 of 36). Tumors were
most commonly found in the lingual (65.0%) and palatine tonsils (27.5%). When
directed biopsies did not locate a tumor, a higher yield was obtained with the
addition of a lingual tonsillectomy in 8 patients.
CONCLUSION: A surgical algorithm for the unknown primary that includes
TLM-assisted techniques, including a lingual tonsillectomy, offers the greatest
likelihood of successfully detecting the location of occult primary tumors.
