BACKGROUND: The main cause of treatment failure and death in laryngeal squamous
cell carcinoma is metastasis to the regional lymph nodes. The current clinical
staging criteria fail to differentiate patients with occult metastasis from
patients without metastasis. Identifying molecular markers of the disease might
improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis
and development of laryngeal carcinoma and may help improve clinical staging and 
treatment.
METHODS: Sixty-four previously untreated patients who underwent surgical excision
of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with neck dissection were included in this
study. The expression of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus
integration site 1 (BMI-1) was examined immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded primary tissue specimens.
RESULTS: Nuclear expression of BMI-1 (nBMI-1) was detected in 32 of the 64 tumors
(50%), cytoplasmic expression of BMI-1 (cBMI-1) was detected in 22 (34.4%), and
10 tumors (15.6%) showed no BMI-1 immunoreactivity. High nBMI-1 expression levels
(≥ 10) were detected in 28 of the 32 (87.5%) nBMI-1-positive patients.
Multivariate analysis including age at diagnosis, grade, tumor location, TNM
status, and nBMI-1 expression showed that a high nBMI-1 expression level was an
independent prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The expression of BMI-1 in patients with laryngeal carcinoma seems to
correlate with lymph node metastasis.
