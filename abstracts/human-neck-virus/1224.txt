BACKGROUND: p16 overexpression is a highly sensitive yet moderately specific
biomarker for predicting human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Nuclear β-catenin translocation has been linked 
to HPV-positive OPSCC. However, whether the strategy of combining β-catenin with 
p16 can better predict HPV-associated OPSCC remains unknown.
METHODS: We evaluated the expression of p16 and β-catenin (nuclear and membrane) 
by immunohistochemistry staining in 101 OPSCC tissues and HPV status by HPV DNA
in situ hybridization. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate single or
multiple biomarkers for HPV prediction. The prediction power, sensitivity, and
specificity were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.
RESULTS: Our data showed that upon univariate analysis, p16 and nuclear β-catenin
were positively correlated with HPV status, while membrane β-catenin was
inversely correlated with HPV status (P < 0.01). p16 showed the highest HPV
predictive power, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9074 compared to 0.6762
for nuclear β-catenin and 0.7635 for membrane β-catenin, respectively, indicating
differential accuracies for HPV prediction. Multivariable analysis showed that
p16 was significantly correlated with HPV, while nuclear and membrane β-catenin
showed marginal significance. The three-biomarker model was similarly sensitive
(98.9% vs. 100%) but more specific (88.9% vs. 81%) than p16 alone, which also
showed a good predictive value for overall (P = 0.0002) survival and disease-free
(P = 0.0158) survival.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a novel model of combining p16 and subcellular
β-catenin for prediction of HPV-associatred OPSCC, and this finding deserves
further validation.
