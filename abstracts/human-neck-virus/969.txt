Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) associated oropharyngeal cancers are on a
significant increase and better therapeutic strategies are needed. The HPV-16
oncogenes E6 and E7 are expressed in HPV-associated cancers and are able to
transform human tonsillar epithelial cells (HTECs). We used cell-Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) to select for RNA aptamers
that entered into HPV-16 E6/E7-HTECs. After 12 rounds of cell-SELEX, a pool of
aptamers was obtained that had significantly greater internalization capacity
(~5-fold) into E6/E7-HTECs as compared to primary HTECs or fibroblasts. Analysis 
of individual aptamers from the pool indicated variable internalization into
E6/E7-HTECs (1-8-fold as compared to a negative control). Most of the individual 
aptamers internalized into E6/E7 and primary HTECs with similar efficiency, while
one aptamer exhibited ~3-fold better internalization into E6/E7-HTECs. Aptamers
that internalize into cells may be useful for delivering therapeutic agents to
HPV-16 associated malignancies.
