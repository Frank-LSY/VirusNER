The prognosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL) used to be poor and this
lymphoma was one of the most difficult lymphoma subtypes to treat. However, in
recent years, novel treatment strategies have been applied, and the prognosis has
greatly improved. Simultaneous chemoradiotherapy is currently regarded as the
standard for nasal ENKL limited at most to neck lymph nodes. For advanced or
relapsed ENKL. L-Asparaginase containing regimen such as SMILE or AspaMetDex is
recommended. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also recommended for such
advanced, relapsed or refractory patients. For all patients with ENKL, fragmented
Epstein-Barr virus-DNA in blood is a good indicator of tumor burden and can
predict tumor response and adverse reaction by chemotherapy. By using these
appropriate strategies, the ENKL is currently recognized as a lymphoma subtype
with intermediate prognosis. Further studies are thus warranted for this
particular lymphoma.
