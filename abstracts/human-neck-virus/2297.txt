Chemotherapy is the only option of treatment for most patients presenting with a 
recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The triple
association of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracile, and cetuximab is still the current
standard for fit patients. Other schemes are currently being compared with this
protocol in ongoing trials and the association of cisplatin, docetaxel, and
cetuximab appears to be the most efficient. The human papilloma virus is very
likely a favorable prognostic factor. Immunotherapy with nivolumab or
pembrolizumab is now a new standard of treatment in second line after yielding an
improvement in overall survival, but predictive markers of efficacy are needed to
refine the selection of patients. The combination of paclitaxel and buparlisib
appears to be promising.
