Oral metastatic tumor, which is uncommon and represents less than 1% of malignant
oral neoplasms, usually arises from a primary mucosal or cutaneous cancer located
in the head and neck regions. Metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to the
oral cavity, especially to gingiva, is extremely rare. A 50-year-old man, who was
a chronic alcoholic and hepatitis B virus carrier, presented with abdominal
distension and weight loss for the past 3 months. Three-phased contrast-enhanced 
abdominal CT revealed numerous conglomerated masses in the liver, suggesting huge
HCCs arising in the background of liver cirrhosis with a large amount of ascites.
He complained of recurrent profuse bleeding from the left upper gingival mass. A 
facial CT revealed an oral cavity mass destructing the left maxillary alveolar
process and hard palate, which was diagnosed as metastatic HCC by an incisional
biopsy. Herein, we report a case of metastatic HCC to the gingiva.
