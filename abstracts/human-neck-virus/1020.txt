In this chapter, we discuss de-esclation of treatment for patients with
HPV-positive disease. We discuss the rationale for de-escalation (why
de-escalate?), patient selection criteria (who to de-esclate?) and what the
treatment options for de-esclation are and the studies that are currently being
run in those areas (how to de-escalate?). We stress the importance of clinicians 
NOT changing the management of oropharyngeal cancer patients outside clinical
trials, and encourage them to recruit to the ongoing studies.
