BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is
uncommon, and the current guidelines for its management refer to adults. Our
objective was to review cases of SSNHL in children and examine their etiologies, 
management, and outcome.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all children under the age 
of 18 years treated for SSNHL between January 2003 and September 2014. Data
recorded included age, gender, symptoms, onset of hearing loss, audiometric
results, diagnostic studies, treatment, and outcome.
RESULTS: Nineteen children were included. Mean age was 14 years (range 7-18
years). Male: female ratio was 9:10. Degree of hearing loss varied from mild to
profound across the tested frequencies. Most common accompanying symptom was
tinnitus. Serologic tests demonstrated recent Epstein-Barr virus infection in one
patient and previous cytomegalovirus infection in six patients. Imaging studies
included computed tomography scan (n=3) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (n=12).
All imaging studies did not demonstrate any pathology. Treatment included
systemic steroids in 19 (100%) children and intratympanic steroids in eight
(42%). Hearing completely improved in three (16%) children, partially improved in
nine (47%), and there was no improvement in six (32%). One child was lost to
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection was a common finding in children with SSNHL and no
pathological changes were demonstrated on imaging studies. In most patients
(63%), hearing improvement was observed. Intratympanic steroid injection can
benefit these children. Further studies are required to investigate the
etiologies and establish guidelines for the management of SSNHL in children.
