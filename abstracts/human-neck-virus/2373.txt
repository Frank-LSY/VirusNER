BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine clinical factors that
predict locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis in patients with human
papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with surgery and
guideline-indicated adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: We identified all presumed HPV-positive patients with oropharyngeal
cancer in our health system from January 2010 to August 2012 treated with surgery
and guideline-indicated adjuvant therapy. Statistical analysis was performed to
identify clinical predictors associated with treatment failure.
RESULTS: One hundred fourteen p16+ oropharyngeal cancers managed with initial
surgical resection were identified. Median follow-up was 17 months. Two-year
locoregional failure was 3.3% and distant failure was 8.4%. Statistical analysis 
found that conventional poor prognostic features did not predict treatment
failure.
CONCLUSION: Locoregional recurrence and development of distant metastatic disease
are uncommon in patients who are appropriately selected for surgical management
of p16+ oropharyngeal cancer regardless of the presence or absence of
conventional poor prognostic features.
