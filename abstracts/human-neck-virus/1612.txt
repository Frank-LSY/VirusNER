Cluster of acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction was associated
with a 2014 outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) respiratory illness in US. We
describe a 33 year-old male patient of refractory dysphagia due to EV-D68-induced
brainstem encephalitis successfully treated by surgery. Following acute upper
respiratory tract infection, he developed dysphagia and bilateral facial
paralysis. A coughing reflex was readily produced when the laryngopharyngeal
fiberscope touched the epiglottis, however, water infusion induced only very weak
and slow swallowing reflex, suggesting that only motor component was impaired but
sensory function was preserved during swallowing. Despite eight
months-conservative rehabilitations, Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) remained
level 4. Therefore, corrective surgeries including cricopharyngeal myotomy,
laryngeal suspension, and pharyngeal flap were performed. Thirty-six days after
surgery, FILS rapidly and dramatically improved to level 8. This is the first
report describing a successful surgical intervention for EV-D68-induced
refractory dysphagia. Surgical treatment was suitable for EV-D68-induced
dysphagia, perhaps because sensory function was preserved and only motor
disturbance was present during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing.
