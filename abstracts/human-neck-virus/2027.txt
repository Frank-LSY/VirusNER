OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare changes in bone mineral density
(BMD) over 144 weeks in HIV-infected patients initiating nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing or protease inhibitor-sparing highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
METHODS: Sixty-three HAART-naïve patients were randomized to
zidovudine/lamivudine+efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir+efavirenz. We performed
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline and at weeks 24, 48, 96 and
144 to evaluate lumbar spine and femoral neck (hip) BMD.
RESULTS: At baseline, 33 patients (55.9%) had low BMD (T-score < -1.0) and of
these eight had osteoporosis (T-score < -2.5). Spine BMD declined in both arms
until week 24, before stabilizing. In the NRTI-sparing arm, the mean percentage
change from baseline was -2.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.9 to -1.4] at
week 24 and -2.5% (95% CI -5.4 to 0.3) at week 144, compared with -3.2% (95% CI
-4.4 to -2.1) and -1.9% (95% CI -3.5 to -0.3) in the protease inhibitor-sparing
arm. Hip BMD declined until week 48 before stabilizing. In the NRTI-sparing arm, 
BMD had decreased by -5.1% (95% CI -7.1 to -3.1) at week 48 and -4.5% (95% CI
-6.9 to -2.1) at week 144, compared with -6.1% (95% CI -8.2 to -4.0) and -5.0%
(95% CI -6.8 to -3.1) in the protease inhibitor-sparing arm. There were no
significant differences between arms. Low baseline CD4 cell count was
independently associated with spine (P=0.007) and hip (P=0.04) BMD loss and low
body mass index with hip BMD loss (P=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Spine and hip BMD declined rapidly 24 to 48 weeks after initiating
HAART, independent of the assigned drug class, but thereafter BMD values remained
stable.
