BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of
unknown primary (CUP).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with and treated for CUP between January 1, 2000,
and June 1, 2011, at two Danish medical centers were included. All patients
received a thorough diagnostic work-up, including FDG-PET, before being diagnosed
as CUP. We determined the HPV status in all patients using a combination of HPV
DNA PCR and p16 stain. In addition, clinical information on the study patients
was retrieved from clinical records.
RESULTS: Of the identified 60 patients with CUP, 13 were shown to be positive for
HPV DNA, amounting to 22% of the study population. In addition, we were able to
show a clear disease-free and overall-survival benefit in the HPV-positive group,
with a hazard ratio of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.038-0.67) for over-all survival. This
survival benefit was also apparent when adjusted for advanced age in a
multivariate Cox regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: A fairly large percentage of CUP cases are HPV-related, and because
this is related to both the location and prognosis, we recommend HPV testing as
part of the diagnostic work-up.
