Human herpesvirus 8-positive (HHV-8⁺) and Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV⁺)
germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder (GLD) is extremely rare and occurs
most commonly in immunocompetent persons who are human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-seronegative. It is also recognized as a favorable response to conventional
chemotherapy. Here, we report a case of a 75-year-old man with an incidentally
found mass in the neck, compatible with GLD, which was detected by positron
emission tomography (PET). Computed tomography (CT) scan, PET, and bone marrow
studies showed only the left neck mass and no evidence of metastasis. Excisional 
biopsy of the mass was performed. The patient received four courses of CHOP
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) therapy. After
these treatments, he remained disease-free for 19 months. To the best of our
knowledge, only five cases of HHV-8⁺, EBV⁺ GLD have been documented. This is the 
first such case report in Asia.
