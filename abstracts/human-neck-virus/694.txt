HR-HPV DNA in pharyngeal swabs was revealed in 25 cases (28.4%) and simultaneously confirmed in all corresponding tissue samples. Sensitivity and specificity of the viral status assessment in the brush biopsies in respect to the RT-PCR/P16(INK4A) 20 were 100% and 96.2%, respectively. HR-HPV positive status was associated with an excellent clinical outcome and reduced hazard ratio of recurrence and disease-related death.
