For systemic delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to solid tumors, we
developed an actively-targeted unimer polyion complex-assembled gold nanoparticle
(uPIC-AuNP) by a two-step assembling process. First is the monodispersed uPIC
formation from the single molecules of therapeutic siRNA and the block catiomer, 
cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide-installed poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(l-lysine)
modified with lipoic acid (LA) at the ω-end (cRGD-PEG-PLL-LA). Second is the
surface decoration of a 20nm-sized AuNP with uPICs. The cRGD-installed uPIC-AuNPs
(cRGD-uPIC-AuNP) provided the targetability for selective binding to the cancer
and cancer-related endothelial cellular surface, while regulating their size
<50nm with a quite narrow distribution. The targeting efficacy of the
cRGD-uPIC-AuNP was confirmed by in vitro cellular uptake in cultured cervical
cancer (HeLa) cells and in vivo tumor accumulation in a subcutaneous HeLa model
after systemic administration, compared with a non-targeted control uPIC-AuNP.
Due to the targetability of the ligand, the cRGD-uPIC-AuNP achieved the
significantly enhanced gene silencing ability in the subcutaneous HeLa tumor.
Ultimately, the systemic delivery of siRNA targeted for papilloma virus-derived
E6 oncogene by cRGD-uPIC-AuNP significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous 
HeLa tumor. This research demonstrates that the bottom-up construction of
nanocarriers using monodispersed building blocks can be employed as delivery
platforms for RNA interference-based cancer therapy.
