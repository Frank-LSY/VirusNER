Ramsay Hunt syndrome is an infection of the head and neck caused by varicella
zoster virus involving the facial nerve; less commonly, other cranial nerves
might be involved. We report a case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome in an immune
compromised patient, with classic facial nerve palsy and ipsilateral ear
vesicles, which rapidly evolved to involve multiple cranial neuropathies, and
improved dramatically with antiviral therapy and corticosteroids. Varicella
zoster virus should be considered as a cause of multiple cranial neuropathies in 
an immune compromised patient, and abrupt treatment with acyclovir should be
initiated once this diagnosis is suspected.
