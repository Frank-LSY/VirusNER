The dramatic rise in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV) has brought significant change to the interaction between patients and head and neck oncologists. HPV-induced cancers are generally the result of elements from the patient's sexual history, and otolaryngologists are generally less experienced than primary care physicians in addressing patient questions relating to sexual history and practices. This article addresses questions commonly posed by patients relating to HPV-induced head and neck cancers, issues related to HPV vaccination, and surveillance of HPV-related lesions. Supporting data are provided such that physicians may be better equipped to sufficiently address patient queries on this topic.
