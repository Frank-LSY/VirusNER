PURPOSE: Radiotherapy is widely used for treatment of many tumor types, but it
can damage normal tissues. It has been proposed that cancer cells can be
selectively sensitized to radiation by adenovirus replication or by using
radiosensitizing transgenes. Adenoviral proteins E1B55K, E4orf3, and E4orf6 play 
a role in radiosensitization, by targeting the Mre11, Rad50, and NBS1 complex
(MRN) and inhibiting DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We hypothesize that
combined with irradiation, these adenoviral proteins increase cell killing
through the impairment of DSB repair.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We assessed the radiosensitizing/additive potential of
replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing E1B55K, E4orf3, and E4orf6
proteins. Combination treatments with low-dose external photon beam radiotherapy 
were studied in prostate cancer (PC-3MM2 and DU-145), breast cancer (M4A4-LM3),
and head and neck cancer (UT-SCC8) cell lines. We further demonstrated
radiosensitizing or additive effects in mice with PC-3MM2 tumors.
RESULTS: We show enhanced cell killing with adenovirus and radiation combination 
treatment. Co-infection with several of the viruses did not further increase cell
killing, suggesting that both E4orf6 and E4orf3 are potent in MRN inhibition. Our
results show that adenoviral proteins E4orf3 and E4orf6, but not E1B55K, are
effective also in vivo. Enhanced cell killing was due to inhibition of DSB repair
resulting in persistent double-strand DNA damage, indicated by elevated
phospho-H2AX levels at 24 h after irradiation.
CONCLUSIONS: This knowledge can be applied for improving the treatment of
malignant tumors, such as prostate cancer, for development of more effective
combination therapies and minimizing radiation doses and reducing side effects.
