AIM: The present study aimed to explore the etiological role of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPV status, including viral load and E6 variants, and the 
expression of P53, p16(INK4A), and FANCD2, in tissues of TSCC (n=24) and
tonsillitis (n=31) were investigated.
RESULTS: The frequency of high-risk HPV (HPV-16) in TSCCs (42%) was higher than
that of tonsillitis (16%). HPV-16 genome was partially or fully integrated in all
HPV-16-positive TSCCs. However, the viral genome was partially integrated in
three out of five HPV-16-positive tonsillitis cases (p=0.037). HPV-16-positive
TSCCs showed a higher frequency of p16(INK4A) expression than HPV-16-negative
TSCCs and tonsillitis (p=0.011). Regardless of HPV status, TSCCs had a lower
expression of FANCD2 than tonsillitis (p=0.008).
CONCLUSION: The present study supports the etiological role of HPV-16 in the
development of TSCC, and p16(INK4A) overexpression can be applied as a surrogate 
marker for the detection of high-risk-HPV in TSCC.
