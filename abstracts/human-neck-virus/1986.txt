BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs)
targeted by miRNAs alter the strength of miRNA binding in a manner that affects
the behaviour of individual miRNAs. An insertion (Ins)/deletion (Del)
polymorphism (rs3783553) in the 3' UTR of IL-1α may disrupt a binding site for
miRNA-122. IL-1α plays an important role in inflammation, immunity and defense
against infection. Thus, we hypothesised that the rs3783553 polymorphism affects 
individual susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oral squamous 
cell carcinoma (OSCC).
METHODS: We genotyped the rs3783553 polymorphism; and determined HPV16 L1
serology, tumour HPV16 DNA and serum IL-1α expression. Univariate/multivariable
logistic regression models were used to calculate associations.
RESULTS: We found that HPV16 L1 seropositivity alone was associated with an
increased risk of OSCC (Odds ratio (OR), 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI),
2.1-4.6), and the risk of HPV16-associated OSCC was modified by the rs3783553
polymorphism. Patients with both HPV16 L1 seropositivity and Del/Del genotype for
the rs3783553 had the highest risk of OSCC when using patients with HPV16 L1
seronegativity and Ins/Del+Ins/Ins genotypes as a comparison group. Notably, that
effect modification was particularly pronounced in several subgroups (e.g. SCCOP,
never-smokers and never-drinkers). The patients with Del/Del genotype were
approximately 3.0 times more likely to have HPV16-positive squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) tumours compared to those patients with
Ins/Del+Ins/Ins genotypes. Additionally, functional relevance of this variant was
characterised to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IL-1α 3' UTR rs3783553 polymorphism may be
functional and influence susceptibility to HPV16-associated OSCC, particularly
for SCCOP. Validation of our findings is warranted.
