Tumor cells frequently overexpress heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and present it
on their cell surface, where it can be recognized by pre-activated NK cells. In
our retrospective study the expression of Hsp70 was determined in relation to
tumor-infiltrating CD56+ NK cells in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
tumor specimens of patients with SCCHN (N = 145) as potential indicators for
survival and disease recurrence. All patients received radical surgery and
postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy (RCT). In general, Hsp70
expression was stronger, but with variable intensities, in tumor compared to
normal tissues. Patients with high Hsp70 expressing tumors (scores 3-4) showed
significantly decreased overall survival (OS; p = 0.008), local progression-free 
survival (LPFS; p = 0.034) and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS;
p = 0.044), compared to those with low Hsp70 expression (scores 0-2), which
remained significant after adjustment for relevant prognostic variables. The
adverse prognostic value of a high Hsp70 expression for OS was also observed in
patient cohorts with p16- (p = 0.001), p53- (p = 0.0003) and HPV16 DNA-negative
(p = 0.001) tumors. The absence or low numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD56+ NK
cells also correlated with significantly decreased OS (p = 0.0001), LPFS
(p = 0.0009) and DMFS (p = 0.0001). A high Hsp70 expression and low numbers of
tumor-infiltrating NK cells have the highest negative predictive value
(p = 0.00004). In summary, a strong Hsp70 expression and low numbers of
tumor-infiltrating NK cells correlate with unfavorable outcome following surgery 
and RCT in patients with SCCHN, and thus serve as negative prognostic markers.
