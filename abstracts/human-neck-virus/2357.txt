The purpose of this article is to provide a descriptive review of risk factors of
head and neck cancer (HNC), with particular interest in their general patterns in
Australia. All these risk factors are deeply perplexing, with socioeconomic,
cultural, and geographic variables. We reviewed articles from PubMed, MEDLINE,
and Google Scholar by using keywords such as risk factors, alcohol, tobacco,
human papilloma virus (HPV), environmental risk factors, and other risk factors. 
We selected relevant articles after they completely fit into the inclusion
criteria for this review. Previous reports highlight that smoking tobacco,
consuming alcohol, and HPV infection are the major risk factors for HNC.
Geographical variations in incidence rates are indicative of differences in the
prevalence of risk factors among countries. HNC could be prevented by reducing
the prevalence of established risk factors.
