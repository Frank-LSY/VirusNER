BACKGROUND: Treatment with a blocking programmed death-1 (αPD-1) antibody
recently showed clinical efficacy for various tumor types. In this study, we
characterized the expression profile of PD-1/programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1)
and the potential of PD-1 blockade in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: Lymphocytes from peripheral blood, draining lymph nodes, and the tumor
were phenotyped for PD-1 expression, and their proliferative activity was
assessed in the presence of blocking αPD-1 treatment. Primary tumor expression of
PD-L1 was also analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: Lymphocyte PD-1 expression was abundant with highest expression in the
tumor, and in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction demonstrated that PD-1 blockade
could induce T cell proliferation. Furthermore, tumor cells were found to have 3 
distinct patterns of PD-L1 expression with over 78% of the specimens
demonstrating strong PD-L1 positivity.
CONCLUSION: Our data strongly supports the use of αPD-1 blockade in patients with
HPV-negative HNSCC that are refractory to standard treatments.
