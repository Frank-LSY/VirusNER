The general prevalence of HPV was 34.05% among civil patients with head and neck cancers. Our analysis of different clinical and pathological indices that affect HPV-associated oral squamous cell carcinomas revealed that non-smoking and non-drinking groups had higher HPV infection rates compared with smoking (P=0.002) and drinking (P< 0.005) groups. In addition, N2-N3 stage patients had higher detectable rates than N0-N1 stage patients (P=0.027).
