Increased awareness of human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiological cause of head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma has increased the interest in analysis of
distinct oral sub-sites. It is currently under debate, whether HPV plays a role
in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC). The
weakness in most published studies is the lack of performing different HPV
detection tests combined with analysis for biological activity of the virus. In
addition, different sub-sites of the oral cavity had been combined to a single
entity, which retrospectively leads to a highly heterogeneous basis of data. In
this review we mainly discuss the unclear role of HPV in OSCC development.
