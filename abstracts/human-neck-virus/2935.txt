HIV-infected persons are living longer on combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART) but experiencing more comorbidities including low bone mineral density
(BMD). Using data from the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and
AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study), we determined the prevalence of
low BMD (T-score below one standard deviation of the reference mean) and compared
it with matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). We also assessed 4-year longitudinal BMD changes among
participants virologically suppressed on cART. Of 653 participants included in
this analysis (77% male, 29% black, median age 41 years, median CD4(+) cell count
464 cells/mm(3), 89% with HIV RNA <400 copies/ml), 51% and 10% had baseline
osteopenia and osteoporosis, respectively. Low BMD at the femoral neck was
significantly more prevalent than for the NHANES controls (47% versus 29%,
p<0.001). Lower body mass index, nonwhite race, longer tenofovir exposure, older 
age, being unemployed or retired, and lower apolipoprotein E were independently
associated with baseline osteoporosis. Among 170 participants virologically
suppressed on cART and with longitudinal BMD data, 31% experienced substantial
bone loss (≥5% BMD decline from baseline) over 4 years. Female sex, current
smoking, and longer stavudine use were more common among participants who had
substantial bone loss, although these variables failed to reach statistical
significance. Low BMD was highly prevalent among HIV-infected persons. One-third 
of participants experienced substantial bone loss despite cART, suggesting the
need for monitoring and potential clinical interventions.
