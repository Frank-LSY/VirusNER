The incidence of oropharyngeal cancers is rising worldwide in both nonsmokers and
nondrinkers. Epidemiology studies suggest a strong association between human
papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection, changing sexual behavior and cancer
development. Despite initial presentation with locally advanced disease and
poorly differentiated histology, HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma is
associated with a good prognosis because its response to chemotherapy and
radiation. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of oropharyngeal cancer in
young people to avoid unnecessary delay in diagnosis and treatment. A history of 
oral sex should be elicited in young patients with enlarged neck nodes and/or
tonsillar masses.
