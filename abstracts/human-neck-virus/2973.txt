BACKGROUND: Erythema multiforme (EM) is a mucocutaneous disease most often
associated with preceding herpes simplex virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection. It is characterized by targetoid lesions occurring on the limbs and
head and neck. Mucosal involvement can be extensive.
OBJECTIVE: We report a case of lip adhesion as a complication of EM in a child
who required corrective surgery and review similar oral commissure complications.
METHODS: We completed a review of the literature for similar cases using PubMed
and Medline.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We present the youngest report of lip adhesion due to 
striking mucositis related to EM. Sequelae of erythema multiforme can be
significant, in our case requiring surgery. Meticulous oral hygiene should be
encouraged when mucosal lesions are identified.
