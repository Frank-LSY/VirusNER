Independently, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and infectious mononucleosis are not
uncommon in the pediatric population, but acute onset of OSA, as a respiratory
complication in the setting of acute EBV infection is extremely uncommon.
Previous reports of this clinical entity are sparse and from nearly two decades
ago. Urgent adenotonsillectomy was commonly advocated. This complication may be
managed medically with systemic corticosteroids and non-invasive continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP), and a case is presented to highlight an updated 
management approach to this rarely encountered clinical problem in children.
