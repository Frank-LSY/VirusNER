BACKGROUND: Spindle cell pseudotumors are formed by histiocytes in response to
infection by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and are rare in
patients without AIDS.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man presented with neck pain, ataxia, and a
history of sarcoidosis. A cerebellar lesion was identified on magnetic resonance 
imaging and surgically excised. Histopathology revealed this to be a spindle cell
pseudotumor and MAC was isolated by bacterial culture of cerebrospinal fluid.
Hematology revealed cluster of differentiation 4 lymphocytopenia but human
immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. The patient was commenced on
antimicrobial treatment that included a macrolide and remained well at 1 year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This rare presentation of isolated intracranial MAC was treated with
surgical excision and antimicrobials with a good outcome.
