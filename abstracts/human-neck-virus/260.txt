AIMS: Approximately 20% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are
caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The effect of arsenic trioxide
(ATO) on HPV oncogene expression of HNSCC cells remains unknown. In this study,
we investigated the anti-cancer activity and possible molecular pathways of ATO
on the six HNSCC cell lines (three HPV-positive and three HPV-negative).
METHODS: The effects of ATO on the cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle of
HNSCC cells were analyzed using CCK-8 assay, colony formation and flow cytometry.
Transwell assay was used to examine the effect of ATO on cell migration. The
transcriptional and protein expression of key genes were determined by real-time 
PCR and Western blot, respectively. Using a xenograft model, we assessed the
effects of ATO on HNSCC cells in vivo.
KEY FINDINGS: HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cells had different expression of 
key genes. ATO inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation and migration and induced
apoptosis and these effects were more significant in HPV-positive HNSCC cells
than in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. ATO treatment reduced the expression of
HPV16-E6/E7 and cyclin D1 proteins and enhanced the expression of p16, pRb, and
p53 in HPV-positive HNSCC cells. By contrast, ATO treatment reduced the
expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1 and mutant p53 and
enhanced the expression of pRb in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. Anti-cancer effect of
ATO on HNSCCs was confirmed by inhibiting xenograft growth in vivo.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that ATO is a potential therapeutic drug for
HNSCCs, especially HPV-positive HNSCCs.
