BACKGROUND: Previous investigations studying the association of DNA viruses with 
salivary gland tumors (SGTs) have led to conflicting results. The aim of this
study was to determine the prevalence of different DNA viruses by using a highly 
sensitive assay in a multi-center series of over 100 fresh frozen salivary gland 
samples.
METHODS: DNA was isolated from 84 SGTs (80 parotid tumors and 4 submandibular
gland tumors) and 28 normal salivary tissue samples from 85 patients in Northeast
Italy. Using a highly sensitive type-specific multiplex genotyping assay, we
analyzed the samples for the presence of DNA from 62 different viruses including 
47 papillomaviruses, 10 polyomaviruses, and 5 herpesviruses.
RESULTS: We observed a high prevalence of beta human papillomavirus DNA in
malignant tumors. In contrast, polyomavirus DNA was present in benign, malignant,
and non-tumor control samples. Most striking was the significant distribution of 
herpesvirus DNA in the SGT samples, in particular the high prevalence of
Epstein-Barr type 1 and type 2 DNA in Warthin's tumor samples.
CONCLUSION: Our data provides evidence for the presence of DNA viruses in SGTs.
Mechanistic studies are needed to further attribute tumor formation to these
viruses.
