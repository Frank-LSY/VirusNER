Recently, some studies have noticed a large number of patients with squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), who are infected with hepatitis C virus
(HCV). The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of HCV in these
patients in our population. Patients with SCCHN in four tertiary centers in
different regions of Iran were checked for HCV. The prevalence of HCV in 107
patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was 0.9%, which has
no significant difference with its prevalence in normal population. It seems that
HCV at least in Iran could not be considered as a risk factor for SCCHN.
