The increased knowledge regarding HPV-infections in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) has unexpectedly contributed to several uncertainties related
to i) prevalence diversities depending on tumour site and geographical origin of 
the patients, ii) proportion of HPV-driven tumours among HPV-DNA-positive cases, 
and iii) identification of patients with HPV-attributed survival benefit. To
investigate this heterogeneity, we analysed 307 HNSCC cases (tonsillar, n=135;
non-tonsillar, n=172) from eight health care centers mostly from Northern Germany
and determined HPV-DNA/mRNA and p16INK4A-status and combined results with the
patient outcome. Overall HPV-DNA prevalence rate was 23.5% (72/307); attributed
to: 43.7% (59/135) and 7.6% (13/172) tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases,
respectively. Among these, 96.6% tonsillar and 38.5% non-tonsillar SCC were
HPV-mRNA-positive. Although the study cohort was composed of patients from
regions of rather close proximity, prevalence rates showed diversities of up to
40% in HNSCC subsite analysis with the lowest prevalence for tonsillar SCC in
metropolitan areas (22.2%) vs. 50.9% in rural areas. Survival analysis identified
p16INK4A alone as strongest predictor, followed by HPV-DNA-status alone or in
combination with p16INK4A. This survival benefit was shown for tonsillar and
non-tonsillar cases. Smoking significantly correlated with HPV-status, however,
it does not influence survival when stratified for HPV. In conclusion, the data
emphasize the urge for further data on HPV-infection in HNSCC to, e.g. clarify to
what extent survival benefits of p16INK4A-positive patients are truly attributed 
to HPV-infections.
