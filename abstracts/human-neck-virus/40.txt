Over the last two decades, it has been recognized that head and neck cancers,
primarily in the oropharynx, can be a distinct entity that is causally related to
human papilloma virus (HPV). Fakhry et al. established in 2008 that such tumors
have a strikingly better prognosis with improved responsiveness to chemotherapy
as well as chemoradiotherapy and favorable survival rates. Since then, new
studies have contributed to our increased understanding of this new entity,
ranging from a detailed understanding of the genetic fingerprint and risk
modifiers such as smoking to successful early attempts to personalize therapy
with de-escalation in the definitive intent treatment setting and specific
evaluation of targeted therapies in this patient population. This Commentary
seeks to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of HPV-associated
head and neck cancers that has emerged since the publication of seminal findings 
by Fakhry et al.
