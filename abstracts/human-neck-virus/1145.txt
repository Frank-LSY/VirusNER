BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the trends in head and neck cancer in
developing countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate trends in
incidence of human papillomavirus-related (HPV-R) and HPV-unrelated (HPV-U) head 
and neck cancer in Lima, Peru, from 1987 to 2008.
METHODS: Registry data from a single public cancer hospital were used to estimate
age and sex-specific incidence rates. Annualized percent change was estimated
using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: The rate of total head and neck cancers, HPV-U, and HPV-R was 11.9,
10.9, and 0.8, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Significant increases in
HPV-U head and neck cancer were observed in men aged 30 to 44 (2.5%/year) and
women 15 to 29 (4.2%/year), 30 to 44 (3.4%/year), and 60 to 74 (2.0%/year).
Significant increases in HPV-R head and neck cancer were observed only among men 
aged 45 to 59 (9.6%/year).
CONCLUSION: Although increased exposure to tobacco, occupational carcinogens, and
changing sexual behaviors could be influencing these trends, additional analyses 
to assess generalizability of these findings to other regions of Peru are needed.
