A 26-year-old male was admitted because of a fever, headache and disturbance of
consciousness with lymph node swelling of the neck two days after developing a
rash. A neurological examination revealed restlessness with irritability in
response to sensory stimuli, such as an injection. Diffusion-weighted brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense ovoid lesion in the
splenium of the corpus callosum, which showed a low coefficient in the ADC map:
the lesion disappeared after 22 days. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of the serum
and cerebrospinal IgM were positive for rubella virus. The patient was therefore 
diagnosed with rubella encephalitis. He recovered gradually and was discharged on
day 19 after the onset of symptoms without any sequelae. To our knowledge, this
is the first case of rubella encephalitis presenting as clinically mild
encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS). Although
the exact mechanism underlying the development of rubella encephalitis is not
well established, this case indicated that our patient had an immune-mediated
secondary encephalitis. According to the survey of the pandemic of rubella from
2012 to April 2013 in Japan, the incidence of rubella encephalitis is thought to 
be relatively higher than was previously noted. This emphasizes the importance of
vaccination for preventing encephalitis.
