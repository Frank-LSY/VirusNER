Data were prospectively collected for all patients with head and neck carcinomas who had undergone HPV testing at the Johns Hopkins Hospital as part of clinical care during a 57-month period. HPV testing consisted of concurrent HPV16 in situ hybridization (ISH) and p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Wide spectrum HPV ISH was reserved for p16-positive cases that were HPV-16 negative.
