Many viruses utilize host ESCRT proteins for budding; however, influenza virus
budding is thought to be ESCRT-independent. In this study we have found a role
for the influenza virus M2 proton-selective ion channel protein in mediating
virus budding. We observed that a highly conserved amphipathic helix located
within the M2 cytoplasmic tail mediates a cholesterol-dependent alteration in
membrane curvature. The 17 amino acid amphipathic helix is sufficient for budding
into giant unilamellar vesicles, and mutation of this sequence inhibited budding 
of transfected M2 protein in vivo. We show that M2 localizes to the neck of
budding virions and that mutation of the M2 amphipathic helix results in failure 
of the virus to undergo membrane scission and virion release. These data suggest 
that M2 mediates the final steps of budding for influenza viruses, bypassing the 
need for host ESCRT proteins.
