Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is causative in human cancer. The E2 protein
regulates transcription from and replication of the viral genome; the role of E2 
in regulating the host genome has been less well studied. We have expressed HPV16
E2 (E2) stably in U2OS cells; these cells tolerate E2 expression well and gene
expression analysis identified 74 genes showing differential expression specific 
to E2. Analysis of published gene expression data sets during cervical cancer
progression identified 20 of the genes as being altered in a similar direction as
the E2 specific genes. In addition, E2 altered the splicing of many genes
implicated in cancer and cell motility. The E2 expressing cells showed no
alteration in cell growth but were altered in cell motility, consistent with the 
E2 induced altered splicing predicted to affect this cellular function. The
results present a model system for investigating E2 regulation of the host
genome.
