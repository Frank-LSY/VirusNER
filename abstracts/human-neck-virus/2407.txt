Head and neck cancers account for approximately 3% of all cancers in the United
States with 62,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The global incidence is
approximately 700,000 new cases a year. There has also been a recent increase in 
human papilloma virus-related oropharyngeal cancers. External beam radiation
therapy (RT) is commonly used as an effective therapy for head and neck (H&N)
cancers. This is used as a definitive treatment (alone or in combination with
chemotherapy) or as an adjuvant treatment after surgical resection of the tumors.
Because of the complex anatomy of the H&N region, several critical structures in 
and around the area receive radiation treatment. This includes the neural
structures (brainstem, spinal cord, and brachial plexus), salivary glands,
mucosa, major blood vessels, and swallowing musculature. Careful RT planning is
necessary to avoid or mitigate the side effects of treatment. This review
discusses some of the major acute and late side effects of RT for H&N cancers and
provides evidence-based guidelines for their management. Patient-reported
outcomes and quality-of-life implications are also discussed.
