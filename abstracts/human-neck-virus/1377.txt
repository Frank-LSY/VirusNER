PURPOSE: Treatment for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) has changed over the past two
decades under multiple influences. We provide a population-based description of
the application of radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy to OPC in 1997, 2004, 
and 2009.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Patterns of Care study for OPC included 
multiple variables not available in the public-use dataset. We identified factors
correlating with selection of primary surgery versus radiotherapy with or without
chemotherapy (RTC) and analyzed predictors of all-cause mortality. We estimated
the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.
RESULTS: RTC was more common in 2009 than in 1997, and was more commonly applied 
to Stage IV cases. However, RTC was not an independent risk factor for mortality 
compared with surgery. HPV status was known in 14% of patients in 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: RTC is the most common treatment for OPC, but it may not provide the
best outcomes. HPV testing was uncommon in 2009.
