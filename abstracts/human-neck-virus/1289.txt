Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC)
comprises approximately 25% of all head and neck cancers (head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma, HNSCC). Epidemiologic studies have shown a dramatic increase of
HPV-OPSCC in the past 2 decades, whereas tobacco-related HNSCC rates are
decreasing worldwide. The distinctions between HPV-OPSCC and oral cavity cancers 
are now reflected in the most recent editions of the World Health Organization
Classification of Tumors of the Head and Neck and the American Joint Committee on
Cancer Staging Manual, respectively. This review describes current understanding 
of the link between HPV infection and OPSCC.
