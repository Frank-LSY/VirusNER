BACKGROUND: Incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal
carcinomas is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this study was to report the
incidence in our region, and to determine the influence of HPV status on survival
among a heavy smoking population.
METHODS: p16 expression was analyzed in 102 patients with stage II to IV treated 
with chemoradiation. Overall survival (OS), locoregional control, and
disease-free survival (DFS) were compared for HPV+ and HPV- status.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were smokers (86%). p16 positivity was found in
26.7%. Patients who were HPV+ were younger (56 vs 59 years old; p = .052). No
differences were observed regarding tumor stage, sex, or smoking between HPV+ and
HPV-. Three-year OS was 67.4% for patients who were HPV+ versus 49.7% for HPV-
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; p = .095).
CONCLUSION: Incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma in Spain is similar 
to that reported in other European countries. In this sample of heavy smokers, we
observed a nonsignificant trend for better outcomes in patients who were HPV+.
