More than 90% of all head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinoma. Despite
advances in the management of patients with this disease, the survival rate has
not been significantly improved. Several mechanisms of carcinogenesis have been
elucidated and molecular targeted agents seem to be promising therapeutic tools. 
Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the EGF receptor, improves survival
rates in association with radiotherapy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (SCCHN) or in palliative disease, and is nowadays the only targeted
agent approved in this indication. Other targeted agents are also clinically
relevant to the treatment of different malignancies, including SCCHN. This
article focuses on the major molecular pathways implicated in SCCHN
carcinogenesis and provides an overview of their therapeutic implications.
