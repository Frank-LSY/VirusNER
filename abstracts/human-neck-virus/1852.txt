PURPOSE: To analyze clinicopathologic parameters of oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC) in different age groups. We hypothesized that clinical and pathologic
parameters of OSCCs will vary in different age groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed. All patients
who were treated for a primary manifestation of OSCC at a single institution from
2001 to 2012 were reviewed and allocated to predefined age groups (predictor
variable) as follows: young (≤40 years), middle-aged (40-80 years), and very
elderly (≥80 years). The following outcome variables were recorded: demographic
parameters, classic risk factors, tumor location and size, neck node involvement,
histopathologic and therapeutic details, and association with human
papillomavirus (HPV). The descriptive statistics were computed. Parametric and
nonparametric tests were used for additional analysis. The significance level was
set at P < .05.
RESULTS: We reviewed 739 patients and identified 11 (1.4%) young (mean age 34.2 ±
2.8 years) and 17 (2.3%) very elderly patients (mean age 83.1 ± 1.2 years). The
predilection site for OSCC was the oral tongue (63%) in young patients, the floor
of the mouth (52%) in middle-aged patients, and the alveolar process (60%) in
very elderly patients. One patient in the young group (9%) and 8 patients in the 
very elderly group (47%) had been exposed to risk factors; however, all of the
examined middle-aged patients had had such exposure. The association of OSCC with
HPV was distributed equally among the age groups. No age-related differences in
the histopathologic parameters of OSCC were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The features of OSCC that vary at different ages are the anatomic
predilection site and the association with classic risk factors. HPV was not an
age-related independent risk factor for OSCC development in the present study.
