In this chapter, we discuss implications of tumor site and tumor microenvironment
properties of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cancer formation with
special emphasis on the therapeutic modality of transoral robotic surgery (TORS).
Over the past years, the development of robotic systems has improved, and
therefore, its use in the surgical treatment of HNSCC has become a relevant
treatment modality for many patients. Yet, there are limitations. Especially for 
endolaryngeal TORS procedures, additional technical development is mandatory,
particularly with respect to visualization and manipulation. The Flex System has 
provided new additions that need to be further evaluated. TORS systems are going 
to improve technical issues and therefore reduce patient morbidity, surgical
handling and treatment costs. The developed systems have to be tested and
evaluated in prospective trials in order to be able to identify benefits and
disadvantages in patient care. With respect to HPV-related OPSCC, TORS has become
a valuable surgical alternative for an increasing number of patients.
