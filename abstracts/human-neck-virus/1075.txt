BACKGROUND: Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is an innate
immunity-associated protein known to inhibit HIV transmission, and is thought to 
inhibit a variety of infectious agents, including human papillomaviruses (HPVs). 
We aimed to optimize an established ELISA-based SLPI quantification assay for use
with oral gargle specimens collected using mouthwash, and to assess preliminary
associations with age, smoking status, and alcohol intake.
METHODS: Oral gargle supernatants from 50 individuals were used to optimize the
Human SLPI Quantikine ELISA Kit. Sample suitability was assessed and quality
control analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Salivary SLPI was successfully recovered from oral gargles with low
intra-assay and high inter-individual variability. Initial measurements showed
that salivary SLPI varied considerably across individuals, and that SLPI was
inversely associated with age.
CONCLUSIONS: This optimized assay can be used to examine the role of SLPI in the 
acquisition of oral HPV and other infections.
