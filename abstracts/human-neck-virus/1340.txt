A rising incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) incidence has
occurred throughout the developed world, where it has been attributed to an
increasing impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) on disease etiology. This report 
presents the findings of a multicenter cross-sectional retrospective study aimed 
at determining the proportion of HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC within the
United Kingdom. Archival tumor tissue blocks from 1,602 patients previously
diagnosed with OPSCC (2002-2011) were collated from 11 centers. HPV status was
determined with three validated commercial tests to provide valid data for 1,474 
cases in total. Corresponding national incidence data from the same decade were
obtained from UK Cancer registries. The overall proportion of HPV+ OPSCC between 
2002 and 2011 was 51.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 49.3-54.4], and this
remained unchanged throughout the decade [unadjusted RR = 1.00 (95% CI,
0.99-1.02)]. However, over the same period, the incidence of OPSCC in the broader
UK population underwent a 2-fold increase [age-standardized rate 2002: 2.1 (95%
CI, 1.9-2.2); 2011: 4.1 (95% CI, 4.0-4.3)]. Although the number of OPSCCs
diagnosed within the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2011 nearly doubled, the
proportion of HPV+ cases remained static at approximately 50%. Our results argue 
that the rapidly increasing incidence of OPSCC in the United Kingdom cannot be
solely attributable to the influence of HPV. The parallel increase in HPV+ and
HPV- cases we documented warrants further investigation, so that appropriate
future prevention strategies for both types of disease can be implemented. Cancer
