BACKGROUND: Women widely use skin-lightening products for cosmetic purposes in
sub-Saharan Africa despite numerous reported cutaneous and systemic
complications. The occurrence of epidermoid carcinoma has long been reported, but
only three cases have been published so far. We report the first case in Mali.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 30-year old woman with no noteworthy medical history was 
seen at our outpatient center for cervical ulceration that had been present for
the last 5 years. She had used cosmetic bleaching cream over a period of around
ten years. Physical examination revealed extensive ulceration on the left side of
her neck. Blood tests for viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus were
negative. The pathological examination of the skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis
of squamous cell carcinoma. After failure of the initial excision with early
relapse, multiple surgical ablations were performed 3 months later.
DISCUSSION: The high prevalence of skin-lightening cosmetic use contrasts with
the rarity of epidermoid carcinoma in depigmented skin. However, a large chronic 
ulcer on uncovered parts of the upper body, particularly the neck, should prompt 
physicians to consider skin cancer. Appropriate preventive measures include the
promotion of educational messages for the general population, the use of
sun-protection devices, and routine skin biopsy for all women presenting chronic 
cervical ulceration after long-term use of skin-lightening products.
