BACKGROUND: Screening of patients for cancer-driving mutations is now used for
cancer prognosis, remission scoring and treatment selection. Although recently
emerged targeted next-generation sequencing-based approaches offer promising
diagnostic capabilities, there are still limitations. There is a pressing
clinical need for a well-validated, rapid, cost-effective mutation profiling
system in patient specimens. Given their speed and cost-effectiveness,
quantitative PCR mutation detection techniques are well suited for the clinical
environment. The qBiomarker mutation PCR array has high sensitivity and shorter
turnaround times compared with other methods. However, a direct comparison with
existing viable alternatives are required to assess its true potential and
limitations.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated a panel of 117 patient-derived tumour
xenografts by the qBiomarker array and compared with other methods for mutation
detection, including Ion AmpliSeq sequencing, whole-exome sequencing and droplet 
digital PCR.
RESULTS: Our broad analysis demonstrates that the qBiomarker's performance is on 
par with that of other labour-intensive and expensive methods of cancer mutation 
detection of frequently altered cancer-associated genes, and provides a
foundation for supporting its consideration as an option for molecular
diagnostics.
CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale direct comparison and validation of currently
available mutation detection approaches is extremely relevant for the current
scenario of precision medicine and will lead to informed choice of screening
methodologies, especially in lower budget conditions or time frame limitations.
