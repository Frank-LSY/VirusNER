PURPOSE: To identify the determinants of antibody responses to adjuvanted
influenza A/H1N1/09 vaccines in a cohort of cancer outpatients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer and controls were enrolled in a
prospective single-center field study. Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted pandemic
influenza vaccine were administered to patients and one dose was administered to 
controls. Antibody responses were measured using hemagglutination inhibition and 
confirmed by microneutralization. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroprotection
rates (defined as GMTs â‰¥40) were compared.
RESULTS: Immunizations were safe and well tolerated in 197 cancer patients
(lymphoma, 57; glioma, 26; lung or head and neck, 37; gastrointestinal, 41;
breast, 36) and 138 controls. Similar seroprotection rates (82.3% versus 87%) and
GMTs (336.9 versus 329.9) were achieved after two doses of adjuvanted vaccine in 
cancer patients and one dose in controls. Univariate analyses identified older
age, prior immunization against seasonal influenza, lymphoma, CD4 count, active
chemotherapy, and rituximab and steroid treatments as being associated with
weaker antibody responses. However, only age and chemotherapy plus rituximab
remained independent determinants of vaccine responses in multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine elicited potent
antibody responses in most cancer patients despite ongoing chemotherapy, with the
exception of rituximab-induced B-cell depletion. Oncology patients treated in an 
outpatient setting benefit from preventive vaccination against influenza with
adjuvanted vaccines.
