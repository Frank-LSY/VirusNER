Half a million new head and neck cancers are diagnosed each year worldwide.
Although traditionally thought to be triggered by alcohol and smoking abuse,
there is a growing subset of oropharyngeal cancers driven by the oncogenic human 
papilloma virus (HPV). Despite advances in both surgical and non-surgical
treatment strategies, survival rates have remained relatively static emphasising 
the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Autophagy, the principal catabolic
process for the lysosomal--mediated breakdown of cellular products is a hot topic
in cancer medicine. Increasing evidence points towards the prognostic
significance of autophagy biomarkers in solid tumours as well as strategies
through which to harness autophagy modulation to promote tumour cell death.
However, the role of autophagy in head and neck cancers is less well defined. In 
the present review, we summarise the current understanding of autophagy in head
and neck cancers, revealing key areas for future translational research.
