PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in nonendemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and assess 
the prognostic implications of viral status.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 62 patients with
primary NPC diagnosed between 1985 and 2011 were analyzed for EBV and high-risk
HPV. EBV status was determined by the use of in situ hybridization for EBV
encoded RNA. HPV status was assessed with p16 immunohistochemistry and multiplex 
polymerase chain reaction MassArray for determination of HPV type. Proportional
hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients as
stratified by viral status.
RESULTS: Of 61 evaluable tumors, 26 (43%) were EBV-positive/HPV-negative, 18
(30%) were HPV-positive/EBV-negative, and 17 (28%) were EBV/HPV-negative. EBV and
HPV infection was mutually exclusive. HPV positivity was significantly correlated
with World Health Organization grade 2 tumors, older age, and smoking (all
P<.001). The racial distribution of the study population was 74% white, 15%
African American, and 11% Asian/Middle Eastern. Among HPV-positive patients, 94% 
were white. At a median follow-up time of 7 years, HPV-positive and
EBV/HPV-negative tumors exhibited worse outcomes than did EBV-positive tumors,
including decreased overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.98, P=.01; and HR 3.89,
P=.002), progression-free survival (HR 2.55, P=.02; and HR 4.04, P<.001), and
locoregional control (HR 4.01, P=.03; and HR 6.87, P=.001).
CONCLUSION: In our Midwestern population, high-risk HPV infection may play an
etiologic role in the development of nonendemic, EBV-negative NPC. Compared with 
EBV-positive NPC, HPV-positive and EBV/HPV-negative NPC are associated with worse
outcomes. A larger confirmatory study is needed to validate these findings.
