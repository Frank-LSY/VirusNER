PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of p16 expression among patients
with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (LSCC) and hypopharynx (HSCC).
METHODS: The medical records of all patients with locally advanced,
non-metastatic LSCC/HSCC were reviewed. p16INK4A (p16) protein expression was
evaluated on pathological specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and locoregional
control (LRC). In select cases, p16 expression was correlated to high-risk and
low-risk HPV genotypes using in situ hybridization (ISH).
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (23 LSCC; 8 HSCC) were identified. Seventeen (54.8%)
patients were p16 negative; 14 (45.2%) were p16-positive. The primary treatment
modality was radiation therapy for 22 (71.0%) patients and surgery for 9 (29.0%).
Nineteen (61.3%) patients were evaluated for high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV
genotypes by IHC, of whom 2 (10.5%) patients were positive for high-risk HPV and 
1 (5.3%) was positive for low-risk HPV. For high-risk HPV, the positive
predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity of p16 was 20.0%, 100%, and 
52.9%. There was no significant difference in the 2-year actuarial rates of OS
(91% vs. 64%, p=0.34) or LRC (51% vs. 46%, p=0.69) between the p16-positive and
p-16 negative patients.
CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of 31 LSCC and HSCC patients, p16 was not a
significant predictive of either LRC or OS. Furthermore, p16 was poorly
correlated with HPV genotyping as identified by ISH.
