OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the human papillomavirus (HPV) status of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) can be reliably predicted based on
sociodemographic and disease characteristics alone. DESIGN A retrospective
medical chart review of clinical and pathologic features.
SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center.
PATIENTS: We studied patients treated for HNSCC who were tested for markers of
HPV or had tissue available for testing between 2006 and 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four otolaryngology-head and neck surgery trainees were
given the database of patient clinical and pathologic features and asked to
predict the HPV status for each patient. The trainees' responses were scored for 
accuracy, positive and negative predictive value, and interrater agreement.
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of HPV
positivity.
RESULTS: A total of 174 patients meeting inclusion criteria were identified, 95
of whom were determined to have HPV-positive tumor tissue. Residents were able to
accurately predict HPV status in 110 to 125 patients (63%-72%), with positive
predictive values of 76% to 84% and negative predictive values of 61% to 69%. The
only variables significantly related to HPV status were male sex (P = .01) and
oropharyngeal subsite (P = .02). Only 4 patients had a "typical" HPV-positive
profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of cancer stage, primary site, basaloid features, tumor
differentiation, and presence of cystic neck disease and patient age, race, and
smoking status did not allow accurate predictions of HPV status in many patients.
Clinical testing of tumor tissue remains essential for a diagnosis of
HPV-positive disease.
