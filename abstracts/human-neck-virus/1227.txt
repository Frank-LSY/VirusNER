Latent Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with several lymphoid and
epithelial malignancies. This is the first reported case of a patient presenting 
with synchronous nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma associated with
Epstein-Barr virus. A 17-year-old previously healthy African-American male
presented with anterior mediastinal mass and a nasopharyngeal mass. Histology
from biopsy of both lesions revealed evidence of Epstein-Barr virus. The patient 
successfully completed sequential therapies with chemo radiation with no evidence
of active disease. Simultaneous occurrence of the two malignancies is undoubtedly
a rare event, and their coexistence raises the question of a common etiologic
factor.
