OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of acute
pharyngo-tonsillitis by a scoring system and the impact of causative pathogens.
METHODS: The patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis were evaluated for causative
pathogens and her clinical symptoms and pharyngotonsillar finding by a clinical
scoring system were assessed.
RESULTS: Streptocococcus pyogenes were identified at 13.6%. Thirty-one viruses
were also identified by PCR. The numbers of total white blood cells and the
levels of C-reactive protein showed a significant positive correlation with
clinical scores (p<0.001) and were significantly higher in cases with S.
pyogenes. The clinical scores rapidly improved after the antimicrobial treatments
in moderate cases and severe cases.
CONCLUSION: A clinical scoring system represents the severity of acute
pharyngotonsillitis and is useful for evaluating clinical course of the illness.
