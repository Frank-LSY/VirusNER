BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of lymph node
density for predicting the survival of patients with tonsillar cancer and
positive neck nodes.
METHODS: We reviewed data for 64 patients diagnosed with tonsillar cancer with
lymph node metastasis in a retrospective single center audit.
RESULTS: Lymph node density (≥0.05), extracapsular spread (ECS), number of ECS
(≥3), vascular invasion, perineural invasion, and N classification (N1/N2a vs
N2b/N2c) were significant predictors of 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). Lymph
node density (≥0.05), human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and N classification 
(N1/N2a vs N2b/N2c) were significant predictors of 5-year overall survival (OS). 
In the multivariate analysis, categorical lymph node density remained a
significant predictor of DFS (p = .025*; hazard ratio [HR] = 6.063) and no
parameter was significantly predictive of OS.
CONCLUSION: Lymph node density might be useful as an independent predictor of
survival in patients with tonsillar cancer and positive lymph nodes. © 2015 Wiley
