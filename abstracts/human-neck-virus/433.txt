H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection has been reported 
in poultry and humans with expanding clade designations. Therefore, a vaccine
that induces immunity against a broad spectrum of H5N1 viruses is preferable for 
pandemic preparedness. We established a second H5N1 vaccine candidate,
A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/2007 (Vac-3), in our virus library and examined the
efficacy of inactivated whole particles of this strain against two clades of H5N1
HPAIV strains that caused severe morbidity in cynomolgus macaques. Virus
propagation in vaccinated macaques infected with either of the H5N1 HPAIV strains
was prevented compared with that in unvaccinated macaques. This vaccine also
prevented propagation of a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in macaques. In the
vaccinated macaques, neutralization activity, which was mainly shown by
anti-hemagglutinin antibody, against H5N1 HPAIVs in plasma was detected, but that
against H1N1 virus was not detected. However, neuraminidase inhibition activity
in plasma and T-lymphocyte responses in lymph nodes against H1N1 virus were
detected. Therefore, cross-clade and heterosubtypic protective immunity in
macaques consisted of humoral and cellular immunity induced by vaccination with
Vac-3.
