INTRODUCTION: Head and neck cancers are the most common cancers worldwide. It is 
estimated that approximately 90% of all head and neck cancers are represented by 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There are many risk factors causing this type of
cancer, including environmental factors and lifestyle choices, such as tobacco
smoking or abusing alcohol. Other important risk factor include infectious
factors.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of BK and JC virus
infections among patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: The correlation between BKV infection and OSCC, and
correlation between BKV, OSCC, alcohol abuse, tobacco smoking, demographic data, 
pre-treatment staging, metastases of lymph node evidence, and grading, was
analyzed. The study group consisted of 92 patients with squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC), 75 males, and 17 females, aged between 40 - 87 (average 56.8). All the
patients underwent surgery and were not subjected to chemotherapy or radiotherapy
prior to treatment. The analyzed samples were collected from paraffin sections.
RESULTS: BKV DNA was detected in 18.5% of patients with OSCC. In the control
group, BKV DNA was detected in 3.3%. BKV DNA was statistically more frequently
detected among patients with squamous carcinoma, compared to the control group
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that the BKV virus may play an
important role in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
