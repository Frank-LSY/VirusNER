BACKGROUND: Oncogenic mechanisms of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive
oropharyngeal cancer are still poorly characterized. Analysis of their microRNA
expression profile might provide valuable information.
METHODS: The microRNA expression profiles were analyzed by micro-arrays in 26
oropharyngeal cancers. A microRNA signature specific to HPV-status was identified
by analyzing a learning/training set consisting of 16 oropharyngeal cancers. The 
robustness of this signature was further confirmed by blind case-by-case
classification of a validation set composed of 10 independent tumors. Putative
targeted molecular pathways were proposed using DIANA miRPath online software
(http://microrna.gr/mirpath).
RESULTS: We have identified 25 miRNA signatures, which discriminates
HPV16-positive oropharyngeal cancer from their HPV-negative counterparts. These
25 microRNAs play a potential role in Wnt and PI3K-pathways,
cell-adhesion/cell-polarity, and the cytoskeleton regulation.
CONCLUSION: Our study contributes to a better understanding of pathogenic
mechanisms involved in the development of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and
in the identification of potential therapeutic molecular targets. © 2016 Wiley
