Golgi apparatus is the organelle mainly functioning as protein processing and
secretion. GOLPH2 is a resident Golgi glycoprotein, usually called GP73. Recent
data displayed that GOLPH2 is a superb hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) marker
candidate, and even its specificity is better than liver cancer marker AFP.
Oncolytic adenoviruses are broadly used for targeting cancer therapy due to their
selective tumor-killing effect. However, it was reported that traditionally
oncolytic adenovirus lack the HCC specificity. In this study, a novel
dual-regulated oncolytic adenovirus GD55 targeting HCC was first constructed
based on our cancer targeted gene-viral therapeutic strategy. To verify the
targeting and effectiveness of GOLPH2-regulated oncolytic adenovirus GD55 in HCC,
the anticancer capacity was investigated in HCC cell lines and animal model. The 
results proved that the novel GOLPH2-regulated GD55 conferred higher adenovirus
replication and infectivity for liver cancer cells than oncolytic adenovirus
ZD55. The GOLPH2-regulated GD55 exerted a significant grow-suppressing effect on 
HCC cells in vitro but little damage to normal liver cells. In animal experiment,
antitumor effect of GD55 was more effective in HCC xenograft of nude mice than
that of ZD55. Thus GOLPH2-regulated GD55 may be a promising oncolytic virus agent
for future liver cancer treatment.
