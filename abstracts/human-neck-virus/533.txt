Rapid and sensitive detection of influenza virus is of soaring importance to prevent further spread of infections and adequate clinical treatment. Herein, an ultrasensitive colorimetric assay called magnetic nano(e)zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MagLISA) is suggested, in which silica-shelled magnetic nanobeads (MagNBs) and gold nanoparticles are combined to monitor influenza A virus up to femtogram per milliliter concentration. Two essential strategies for ultrasensitive sensing are designed, i.e., facile target separation by MagNBs and signal amplification by the enzymelike activity of gold nanozymes (AuNZs). The enzymelike activity was experimentally and computationally evaluated, where the catalyticity of AuNZ was tremendously stronger than that of normal biological enzymes. In the spiked test, a straightforward linearity was presented in the range of 5.0 Ã— 10
