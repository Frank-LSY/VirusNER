INTRODUCTION: Much research demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of gene
transfer to salivary glands. Recently, the first clinical trial targeting a
salivary gland was completed, yielding positive safety and efficacy results.
AREAS COVERED: There are two major disorders affecting salivary glands: radiation
damage following treatment for head and neck cancers and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS).
Salivary gland gene transfer has also been employed in preclinical studies using 
transgenic secretory proteins for exocrine (upper gastrointestinal tract) and
endocrine (systemic) applications.
EXPERT OPINION: Salivary gland gene transfer is safe and can be beneficial in
humans. Applications to treat and prevent radiation damage show considerable
promise. A first-in-human clinical trial for the former was recently successfully
completed. Studies on SS suffer from an inadequate understanding of its etiology.
Proof of concept in animal models has been shown for exocrine and endocrine
disorders. Currently, the most promising exocrine application is for the
management of obesity. Endocrine applications are limited, as it is currently
impossible to predict if systemically required transgenic proteins will be
efficiently secreted into the bloodstream. This results from not understanding
how secretory proteins are sorted. Future studies will likely employ
ultrasound-assisted and pseudotyped adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene
transfer.
