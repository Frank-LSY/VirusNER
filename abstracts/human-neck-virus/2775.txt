OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To describe the demographics, clinical manifestations,
diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of laryngeal cryptococcosis. Antifungal
therapy guidelines are provided and the use of laser ablation is discussed.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, and Embase databases and one patient who
presented to our institution's otolaryngology department.
REVIEW METHODS: A review of the English-language international medical literature
was conducted using the terms ("larynx" or "laryngeal diseases") and
("Cryptococcus" or "cryptococcosis") to identify reported cases of laryngeal
cryptococcosis. Databases were searched from inception through January 2015.
RESULTS: Eighteen cases were identified and reviewed, including the first
reported case of potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser ablation. All patients
presented with hoarseness, and two (11%) presented with acute airway obstruction 
that required tracheotomy. Six patients (33%) were immunocompromised, including
three (17%) who had an underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection. Seven
cases (39%) described an exophytic mass. Histopathology indicated
pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in seven of the 17 reported results (41%).
Methenamine silver stain was used in 12 of the 15 described cases (80%) to
identify the fungus. Lumbar puncture results were reported for seven patients,
none of whom had meningitis. Antifungal therapy was used in 15 cases (83%), and
two (11%) received additional laser ablation treatment. Eleven patients (61%) had
complete resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal cryptococcosis is a rare cause of persistent hoarseness.
Most patients have complete resolution after treatment. For complex and
obstructive cases, laser ablation coupled with antifungal therapy can
successfully manage laryngeal cryptococcosis in select patients.
