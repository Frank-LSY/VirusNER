OBJECTIVES: To review our current knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of
otosclerotic bone remodeling including genetics, viral infection, autoimmunity
and inflammation and to discuss disease pathogenesis with relevance for
pharmacotherapy.
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODOLOGY: Relevant publications on the etiopathogenesis,
molecular biology, genetics and histopathology of otosclerosis from 1984 to 2009 
were analyzed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Otosclerosis is a bone remodeling disorder of the human 
otic capsule, however, the etiopathogenesis remains unclear. Genetic
predisposition, disturbed bone metabolism, persistent measles virus infection,
autoimmunity, hormonal and environmental factors also may play contributing roles
in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis. Since, diagnosis of otosclerosis is still
based on histopathological examination of the removed stapes footplate, systemic 
prospective studies based on comprehensive histopathological and molecular
biological analysis are necessary to get further information about the background
of disease.
