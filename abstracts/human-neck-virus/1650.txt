BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy 
that exhibits clinically aggressive features and is associated with a poor
prognosis. The incidence of MCC seems to be increasing for reasons unknown, and
is estimated to be 0.32/100,000 in the United States.
METHODS: This article will review the current literature and National
Comprehensive Cancer Network practice guidelines in the treatment of MCC.
RESULTS: Resection of MCC with negative margins remains the mainstay of therapy. 
Positive nodal disease should be treated with neck dissection and adjuvant
radiotherapy. High-risk patients should undergo adjuvant radiotherapy, which
improves oncologic outcomes. The role of chemotherapy is less clear and is
currently reserved for advanced-stage MCC and palliative therapy.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of MCC has recently been impacted with the discovery
of the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Research to establish targeted and
immunologic therapeutic options are ongoing.
