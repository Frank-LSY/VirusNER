Objective:To improve recognization of clinical, imaging and pathological
characteristics of lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the salivary
glands.Method:The clinical manifestations, imaging features, histological and
immunohistochemical characteristics of LEC of the salivary glands (n = 12)
between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed.Result: Four cases of male
and 8 cases of female were enrolled, and the average age of 53.25 years. Ten
lesions were located in the parotid gland, and 2 cases were in the submandibular 
gland. Two cases were unilateral multiple tumors, 10 cases were unilateral
solitary tumor, 4 cases were with cervical lymph node metastasis and 1 case was
with peripheral facial paralysis. Ten patients had positive EB VCA IgA test.
Homogeneous density and obvious enhancement were achieved in all lesions on CT
scan. 8 cases were with irregular shapes, partially or ill-defined margin, and
heterogeneous enhancement. Incomplete capsule was found in 4 cases, while no
obvious capsule was found in 6 cases. HE staining showed that the infiltrative
tumors were formed by the presence of sheets or nests of epithelial cells and
interstitial lymphoid tissue. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the
epithelial cells were reactive for pan CK, the lymphoid cells showed reactivity
for both CD20 and CD3 markers. All cases underwent primary tumor and involved
gland resection with ipsilateral neck dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy,
and 2 cases combined with postoperative chemotherapy. The 3 year survival rate of
patients was 75.0%(9/12), and 3 cases died of local recurrence or (and) distant
metastasis within 1-2 years of definite diagnosis.Conclusion: LEC of salivary
gland is associated with EB virus infection. Most cases present with unilateral
solitary mass, and incidence of regional lymph node involvement is high. The
imaging characteristics of tumor seem to be malignant on CT scan in most cases.
Treatment includes multimodality therapy including surgical resection, neck
dissection, and radiotherapy. Local recurrence and distant metastasis are the
main causes of death.
