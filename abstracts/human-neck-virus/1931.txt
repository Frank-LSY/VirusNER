CONTEXT: HIV patients are at an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease
secondary to depot-specific alterations in adipose function, but mechanisms
remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: The endoribonuclease Dicer has been linked to the modulation of brown 
and white adipocyte differentiation. We previously demonstrated that Dicer
knockout mice undergo transformation of brown adipose tissue to white adipose
tissue and develop a lipodystrophic phenotype. We hypothesized reduced Dicer and 
brown adipose tissue gene expression from nonlipomatous sc fat among HIV patients
with a lipodystrophic phenotype.
DESIGN: Eighteen HIV (nine with and without lipodystrophic changes in fat
distribution, characterized by excess dorsocervical adipose tissue [DCAT]) and
nine non-HIV subjects underwent punch biopsy of abdominal sc fat to determine
expression of Dicer and other adipose-related genes.
RESULTS: HIV subjects with long-duration antiretroviral use demonstrated excess
DCAT vs non-HIV subjects (9.8 ± 1.0 vs 6.6 ± 0.8 cm(2), P = .02) with similar
body mass index. Dicer expression was decreased in abdominal sc fat of HIV vs
non-HIV (4.88 [1.91, 11.93] vs 17.69 [10.72, 47.91], P = .01), as were PPARα,
ZIC1, PRDM16, DIO2, and HSP60 (all P ≤ .03). Moreover, the expression of Dicer
(2.49 [0.02, 4.88] vs 11.20 [4.83, 21.45], P = .006), brown fat (PPARα [P =
.002], ZIC1 [P = .004], LHX8 [P = .03], PRDM16 [P = .0008], PAT2 [P = .008],
P2RX5 [P = .02]), beige fat (TMEM26 [P = .004], CD137 [P = .008]), and other
genes (DIO2 [P = .002], leptin [P = .003], HSP60 [P = .0004]) was further
decreased in abdominal sc fat comparing HIV subjects with vs without excess DCAT.
Down-regulation of Dicer in the abdominal sc fat correlated with the
down-regulation of all brown and beige fat genes (all P ≤ .01).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate dysfunctional sc adipose tissue marked by
reduced Dicer in relationship to the down-regulation of brown and beige
fat-related genes in lipodystrophic HIV patients and may provide a novel
mechanism for metabolic dysregulation. A strategy to increase browning of white
adipose tissue may improve cardiometabolic health in HIV.
