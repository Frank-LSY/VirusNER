OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical
manifestations, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology, and treatment outcome of
patients with nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma (NPAC).
DESIGN: A retrospective study of clinical data from consecutive patients with
NPAC identified between 1964 and 2000.
SETTING: A tertiary cancer center in China.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight patients diagnosed with NPAC.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crosstabs and chi-square test were conducted to study the 
association of positive VCA-IgA levels among different pathological types of
NPAC, and also to compare the proportions of local control rates in patients
treated with different modalities. The survival rate was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the Log Rank test was used to compare the survival rates
considering different factors. To balance the distribution bias, a multivariate
COX model survival analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Of the 48 NPAC patients identified, 45% presented with cervical
metastasis. Pathologically, 58% of NPAC cases were common type and 42% were
salivary gland type. The positive rate for the EBV antibody VCA-IgA in all
patients was 53% and only 24% in the salivary gland type of NPAC. The overall
local control rate and the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 87% and 65%
respectively. Patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy (RT) had a
significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival rate than patients receiving RT
alone (89%versus 75% respectively) (P = 0.039). Multivariate analysis confirmed
that treatment modality was the significant factor influencing patient survival
(P = 0.027) and the pathological type was not a factor predicting survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma is a distinct entity in all types of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma and EBV serology has limited value in its diagnosis. The
combination of surgery and RT should be considered for treatment of early lesions
of NPAC.
