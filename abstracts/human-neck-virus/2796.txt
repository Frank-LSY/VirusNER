OBJECTIVES: To examine outcomes of selective neck dissection (SND) in patients
with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) who present with clinical neck disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective review.
METHODS: Two institutional databases of patients with HPV-related OPSCC were
reviewed to identify patients with clinical (c) N1-N3 neck disease who underwent 
SND ± adjuvant therapy.
RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-four patients were identified with a median
follow-up of 49 months (range 3-199 months). All patients underwent transoral
resection of the primary tumor and SND, including levels II-IV and ± levels I or 
V, with resection of additional nonlymphatic tissue (extended SND) as indicated
by extent of disease, including the spinal accessory nerve (7%), the internal
jugular vein (13%), and the sternocleidomastoid muscle (8%). Two hundred and
seventy (83%) patients underwent adjuvant radiation. There were 13 (4%) regional 
recurrences and 19 (6%) distant recurrences. Regional control following salvage
was 98%. On univariable analysis, absence of radiation was associated with
regional recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-29.4).
On multivariable analysis, adjuvant radiation was associated with improved
disease-free survival (DFS) (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.53) but lost significance for
overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P > 0.05). Five-year
Kaplan-Meier estimates for OS, DSS, and DFS were 88% (95% CI 84%-92%), 93% (95%
CI 89%-96%), and 83% (95% CI 78%-87%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In HPV-related OPSCC presenting with clinical neck disease, a SND ±
additional tissue resection and adjuvant therapy, when indicated, provides
excellent long-term regional control. Omission of radiotherapy increases the risk
of regional recurrence, although it may not significantly impact OS or DSS. It
appears unnecessary to routinely perform a comprehensive neck dissection.
