The results of treatment of head and neck tumors remain poor for decades. It
means that after surgery, chemotherapy is not a proper choice, as tumors of this 
region are relatively resistant to cytotoxic drugs. A little progress was noted
only for radiotherapy outcome. Consequently, clinicians and researchers'
expectations are focused on targeted therapy, where microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) seem
to be the most promising target. After the year 2000, miRNAs became new players
on the scene of cancer science. Since then, extensive investigations have been
performed with a hope of finding a new prognostic and diagnostic tool and
bridging them with a bright new way of understanding the basis of molecular
carcinogenesis. miRNAs display astonishing specificity and thus are associated
with pathoclinical parameters of the disease. After more than a decade of ongoing
studies, in this review we attempt to summarize the current knowledge of miRNAs
in malignancies arising in head and neck sites and with a majority of squamous
cells of the epithelium.
