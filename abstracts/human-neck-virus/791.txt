Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common human cancer types with a very poor prognosis despite improvements in therapeutic modalities. The major known risk factors are tobacco use and alcohol consumption or infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPV), especially in oropharyngeal tumors. The current management based on the assessment of a variety of clinical and pathological parameters does not sufficiently predict outcome.
