It was established, that HPV virus (Human Papilloma Virus) is responsible for
tumor induction in some anatomical regions of head and neck, mainly in palatine
tonsils. The characteristics of HPV-related tumors as well as the course of the
disease are definitely different compared to tobacco-smoking related tumors;
patients HPV-positve have better prognosis - less patients develops recurrences
and dies from the disease. There is no full compliance about patients'
characteristics, although most indications concern "young adults" with their
intensive sexual life. Because the course of HPV-related tumors is milder, there 
is a need to distinguish the cause of disease to carry on the therapy adjusted to
the causative factor. This approach might help to select HPV-negative patients
with severe course of disease to apply more aggressive chemotherapy.
