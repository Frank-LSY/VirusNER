BACKGROUND: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has become an accepted first-line
treatment for T1 and T2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The
growing popularity of this procedure is the result of mounting skepticism as to
the survival and quality of life (QOL) benefits of primary chemoradiation over
definitive surgery, the rising incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in progressively younger patients, 
and the advantages of TORS over transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) and open
surgery.
METHODS: The authors use their experience and data gained from the TORS-based
management of >100 patients to establish a systematic approach to the use of TORS
in HNSCC.
RESULTS: This approach is constructed on a framework which goal is to select the 
primary treatment option that is most likely to reduce morbidity while preserving
function and maintaining oncologic safety.
CONCLUSION: A consensus regarding the indications of TORS and its role in the
multidisciplinary management of HNSCC is to be established. © 2015 Wiley
