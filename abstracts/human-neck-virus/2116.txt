OBJECTIVE: (1) To understand if awareness of the human papilloma virus (HPV)
vaccination's potential to prevent head and neck cancer improves acceptability of
the vaccine in a large urban population and (2) to identify characteristics of
those in whom such discussions would have the greatest impact.
STUDY DESIGN: In-person, anonymous survey.
SETTING: Academic public hospital between March 2014 and June 2014.
SUBJECTS: Patients aged 12 to 24 years and their parents or guardians awaiting
scheduled outpatient pediatric appointments.
METHODS: Demographics and modified Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and
Beliefs Scales data were cross-analyzed, followed by univariate binomial logistic
regression to identify predictors for major outcomes of interest.
RESULTS: More than 78% of those surveyed indicated they would be more receptive
to the HPV vaccine if given strong evidence that it prevented head and neck
cancer. Respondents were more likely to increase receptivity to HPV vaccination
if they held the belief that they did not have enough information about the
vaccine or indicated they preferred to wait because the vaccine was too new.
CONCLUSION: Increasing public awareness of head and neck cancer prevention with
HPV vaccination could increase HPV vaccination acceptance.
