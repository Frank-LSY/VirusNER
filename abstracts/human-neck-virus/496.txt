BACKGROUND: Cervical lymphadenopathy could be a manifestation of occult
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is frequently detected
in NPC, and its malignant transformation is associated through the action of the 
oncoprotein latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1).
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a primary
nasopharyngeal origin could be localized by detection of EBV LMP-1 gene in
cervical metastatic lymph nodes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 32 paraffin-embedded tissues of
various head and neck carcinomas and 20 normal tonsil specimens were examined for
the presence of LMP-1 gene, using polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Ten of 12 nasopharyngeal biopsies and 8 of 10 metastatic lymph nodes of 
the same NPC were positive for LMP-1 gene. The LMP-1 gene was detected in
metastatic lymph nodes of NPC, with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 100%,
positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 91%. On the
contrary, the LMP-1 gene was not detected in any of the samples of other head and
neck carcinomas and their metastatic nodes as well as in tonsillar specimens.
There was a significant association between the presence of LMP-1 gene and tumor 
location in the nasopharynx (P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of LMP-1 gene in metastatic cervical lymph nodes is
significantly associated with nasopharyngeal origin of the carcinoma. Meanwhile, 
EBV has no role in the tumorigenesis of carcinomas arising from other head and
neck regions.
