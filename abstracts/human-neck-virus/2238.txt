BACKGROUND: Antibodies (Abs) to the HPV16 proteome increase risk for
HPV-associated OPC (HPVOPC). The goal of this study was to investigate the
association of a panel of HPV16 Abs with risk for OPC as well as the association 
of these Abs with tumor HPV and smoking status among patients with OPC.
METHODS: IgG Abs to the HPV16 antigens E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1, L2 were
quantified using a programmable ELISA assay. Sera were obtained from 258 OPC
patients at diagnosis and 250 healthy controls. HPV16 tumor status was measured
by PCR for 137 cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate
odds ratios for the association of HPV16 Abs with risk for OPC.
RESULTS: HPV16 E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7 and L1-specific IgG levels were elevated in
OPC patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). After multivariable
adjustment, Ab positivity for NE2, CE2, E6, and/or E7 was associated with OPC
risk (OR [95% CI], 249.1 [99.3-624.9]). Among patients with OPC, Ab positivity
for these antigens was associated with tumor HPV status, especially among never
or light smokers (OR [95% CI], 6.5 [2.1-20.1] and OR [95% CI], 17.5 [4.0-77.2],
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies to HPV16 proteins are associated with increased risk for 
HPVOPC. Among patients with OPC, HPV16 Abs are associated with tumor HPV status, 
in particular among HPV positive patients with no or little smoking history.
