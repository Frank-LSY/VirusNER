BACKGROUND: Few human papillomavirus (HPV)(+) head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines exist. We established University of
Michigan-squamous cell carcinoma-104 (UM-SCC-104), a new HPV(+) HNSCC cell line
from a recurrent oral cavity tumor, and characterized it for the presence of
cancer stem cells (CSCs).
METHODS: Tumor cells were tested for biomarker expression by immunohistology, and
the presence of HPV was assessed by several methods.
RESULTS: UM-SCC-104 has a unique genotype, contains HPV-16, and expresses E6/E7. 
Inoculation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)(+) and ALDH(-) cells in an
immunocompromised mouse resulted in tumor growth from the ALDH(+) cells after 6
weeks that recapitulated the histology of the primary, whereas ALDH(-) cells did 
not produce tumors.
CONCLUSION: UM-SCC-104, a new HPV-16, CSC-containing HNSCC cell line will aid in 
studying recurrent HPV(+) tumors. The aggressive nature of this tumor is
consistent with high uniform expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and a functionally significant proportion of ALDH(+) CSCs.
