OBJECTIVE: In a previous study, we reported the value of p16 expression and
alcohol consumption in oropharyngeal carcinoma in Japan. We now report the
clinical significance of human papillomavirus status and p16 expression in
oropharyngeal carcinoma in Japan.
METHODS: Over a 9-year period, a retrospective case comparison study of the
pathology database was conducted at the University of Tokyo to identify tumor
samples of oropharyngeal carcinoma. We performed immunohistochemistry for the p16
protein, in situ hybridization for human papillomavirus-deoxyribonucleic acid and
polymerase chain reaction for the human papillomavirus-deoxyribonucleic acid
oncogene E6 in oropharyngeal carcinoma in Japanese patients. We evaluated the
human papillomavirus status in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma to determine
its prevalence and association with prognosis. We defined human papillomavirus(+)
and human papillomavirus(-) oropharyngeal carcinoma cohorts as those with and
without polymerase chain reaction for the human papillomavirus-deoxyribonucleic
acid oncogene E6 or in situ hybridization-human papillomavirus.
RESULTS: In oropharyngeal carcinoma, the prevalences of p16(+)human
papillomavirus(+), p16(+)human papillomavirus(-), p16(-)human papillomavirus(+)
and p16(-)human papillomavirus(-) were 32% (48/150), 7% (10/150), 2% (3/150) and 
59% (89/150), respectively. Low tobacco and alcohol consumption, tonsil or base
of tongue localization, but not age, were associated with p16(+)human
papillomavirus(+). Low alcohol consumption was associated with p16(+)human
papillomavirus(-). There was a significant difference in overall survival between
p16(+)human papillomavirus(-) and p16(-)human papillomavirus(-) (P = 0.03). In
multivariate Cox regression models, p16 was the independent prognostic factor,
regardless of human papillomavirus status.
CONCLUSION: p16 expression was a reliable prognostic biomarker regardless of
human papillomavirus status.
