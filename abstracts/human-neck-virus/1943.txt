OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to establish an ELISA method, as well as the 
cut-off value, for IgA against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen
(VCA), as a screening assay for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in southern China.
In addition, the correlation between relative optical density (rOD) values from
ELISA and titers from the immunoenzymatic assay (IEA) was also evaluated.
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight NPC cases, 33 non-NPC head and neck cancer
patients, and 1156 healthy controls were recruited for this study. VCA-IgA and
early antigen (EA)-IgA were measured by ELISA kits and IEA in parallel.
RESULTS: The total precision of the VCA-IgA ELISA achieved a level of <13.0%
coefficient of variation. An rOD value of 1.60 for the VCA-IgA ELISA was
determined as the cut-off point for southern China, and the sensitivity and
specificity for NPC diagnosis when using this cut-off value were 93.0% and 92.4%,
respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC) value was 0.969. The correlation coefficient between titers and rOD
values was 0.957. rOD values were correlated with NPC overall stage and lymph
node involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: The cut-off level established in our study could be used to
facilitate more accurate diagnosis of NPC in southern China. The rOD value might 
be an index for NPC prognosis, since it shows a good correlation with the titer
from IEA.
