BACKGROUND: The main concerns with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer in 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients include limited tumor
response and profound mucosal or skin toxicities under severe immunocompromised
status.
METHODS: In this study, we describe the clinicopathological features,
chronological changes in HIV viral loads and CD4 counts, and treatment outcomes
of definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer in an
HIV-infected patient.
RESULTS: Despite low CD4 counts (80 cells/µL), a combination of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (70 Gy
of simultaneously integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT),
fluorouracil, and leucovorin) was well-tolerated. Grade 3 mucositis and
dermatitis were resolved 2 weeks after treatment completion. The patient was
alive and remained disease-free 31 months after treatment.
CONCLUSION: For patients with HIV diagnosed with locally advanced head and neck
cancer, good tolerance and outcome can be achieved with definitive radiotherapy
while on HAART.
