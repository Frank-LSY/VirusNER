BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To study the characteristics of chronic actinic dermatitis
(CAD) in a heterogeneous group of Singaporean patients.
METHODS: The photobiologicial features of all patients phototested and diagnosed 
with CAD from January 2005 to December 2009 were examined retrospectively.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were diagnosed as having CAD. The mean age at
diagnosis was 62 years (range 35-83). Forty-one were (70.7%) Chinese, six (10.3%)
Indians, eight (13.8%) Malays, and three (5.2%) Others. Forty-seven were (81.0%) 
male and 11 (19.0%) were female. Forty-nine (84.5%) had Fitzpatrick skin
phototype IV and nine (15.5%) had phototype V. Three of 26 (11.5%) tested for
human immunodeficiency virus were positive. The face, neck, and forearms were
most commonly affected. Thirty-two patients (55.2%) had reduced minimal erythema 
dose (MED) to both ultraviolet B (UVB)and ultraviolet A (UVA), 23 patients
(39.7%) had lowered MED to UVB only, while three (5.1%) had reduced MED to UVA
only. Patients were followed up for a mean of 16.8 months. All were treated with 
photoprotection and topical steroids; however, a few required oral
immunosuppression with partial improvement.
CONCLUSION: In Singapore, CAD was seen more commonly in elderly Chinese males of 
Fitzpatrick skin phototype IV. Reduced MED to both UVB and UVA was the most
common phototest finding.
