Human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated cervical carcinogenesis represents a well
analyzed model of viral implication in epithelial malignant transformation.
Mechanisms of high risk (HR) HPV-related infection seem to demonstrate a similar 
action regarding its implication in head and neck (HN) carcinomas, predominantly 
in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histological type. The prevalence of HR HPV
subtypes - mainly HPV16 - is characterized by a broad geographic heterogeneity.
Furthermore, HPV-associated HNSCCs demonstrate differences regarding sexual,
molecular, epidemiological, and prognostic features compared to alcohol and
tobacco dependent ones. Based on these differences, HPV-derived HNSCC appear to
be a specific well-defined entity mostly affecting young to middle-aged - male
mainly - non-smokers. This is a strong reason of detecting an increased HR-HPV
DNA levels -due to viral transmission - in oropharyngeal and laryngeal anatomic
regions. Additionally, different response rates to chemoradiation and targeted
therapeutic regimens are another significant field for handling these SCC
malignancies in the corresponding patients. In the current special article we
explored the role of HPV-related carcinogenesis in oropharyngeal and laryngeal
SCC focused on the latest molecular aspects.
