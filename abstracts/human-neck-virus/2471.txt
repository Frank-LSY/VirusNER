PURPOSE: To perform a prospective, multi-institutional, phase 2 study of a
substantial decrease in concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) intensity as
primary treatment for favorable-risk, human papillomavirus-associated
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The major inclusion criteria were: (1) T0 to T3, N0 to
N2c, M0; (2) human papillomavirus or p16 positive; and (3) minimal/remote smoking
history. Treatment was limited to 60 Gy intensity modulated radiation therapy
with concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatinum (30 mg/m(2)). The primary study
endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate based on required biopsy of 
the primary site and dissection of pretreatment positive lymph node regions,
regardless of radiographic response. Power computations were performed for the
null hypothesis that the pCR rate is 87% and n=40, resulting in a type 1 error of
14.2%. Secondary endpoint measures included physician-reported toxicity (Common
Toxicity Terminology for Adverse Events, CTCAE), patient-reported symptoms
(PRO-CTCAE), and modified barium swallow studies.
RESULTS: The study population was 43 patients. The pCR rate was 86% (37 of 43).
The incidence of CTCAE grade 3/4 toxicity and PRO-CTCAE severe/very severe
symptoms was as follows: mucositis 34%/45%, general pain 5%/48%, nausea 18%/52%, 
vomiting 5%/34%, dysphagia 39%/55%, and xerostomia 2%/75%. Grade 3/4 hematologic 
toxicities were 11%. Thirty-nine percent of patients required a feeding tube for 
a median of 15 weeks (range, 5-22 weeks). There were no significant differences
in modified barium swallow studies before and after CRT.
CONCLUSIONS: The pCR rate with decreased intensity of therapy with 60 Gy of IMRT 
and weekly low-dose cisplatinum is very high in favorable-risk oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma, with evidence of decreased toxicity compared with
standard therapies. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01530997.
