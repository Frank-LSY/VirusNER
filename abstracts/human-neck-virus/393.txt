We infected six well-characterized HNSCC cell lines (Cal27, Detroit562, FaDu, SCC4, SCC15, SCC25), with increasing doses of a panel of poxviruses (including myxoma, vaccinia, raccoonpox and tanapox viruses) modified to express green fluorescence protein to determine which virus was the most effective oncolytic agent in cell-based assays.
