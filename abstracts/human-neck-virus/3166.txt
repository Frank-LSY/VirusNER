OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a novel compound heterozygous mutations
c.257C>G (p.T86R)/c.176del16 (p.G59A fs*18) in GJB2 result in hearing loss.
METHODS: Allele-specific PCR-based universal array (ASPUA) screening and sequence
analysis were applied to identify these mutations. 3D model was built to perform 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to verify the susceptibility of the mutations.
Furthermore, WT- and Mut-GJB2 DNA fragments, containing the mutation of c.257C>G 
and c.176del16 were respectively cloned and transfected into HEK293 and spiral
ganglion neuron cell (SGNs) by lenti-virus delivery system to indicate the
subcellular localization of the WT- and Mut-CX26 protein.
RESULTS: A novel compound heterozygous mutation c.257C>G (p.T86R)/c.176del16
(p.G59A fs*18) in GJB2 was identified in a Chinese family, in which 4 siblings
with profound hearing loss, but the fifth child is normal. By ASPUA screening and
sequencing, a compound heterozygote mutations in GJB2 c.257C>G
(p.T86R)/c.176del16 (p.G59A fs*18) were identified in these four deaf children,
each of the mutated GJB2 gene were inherited from their parents. There is no
mutation of GJB2 gene identified in the normal child. Besides, the compound
heterozygous mutation GJB2 c.257C>G (p.T86R)/c.176del16 (p.G59A fs*18) could lead
to the alterations of the subcellular localization of each corresponding mutated 
CX26 protein and could cause the hearing loss, which has been predicted by MD
simulation and verified in both 293T and SGNs cell line.
CONCLUSION: The c.257C>G (p.T86R)/c.176del16 (p.G59A fs*18) compound mutations in
GJB2 detected in this study are novel, and which may be associated with hearing
loss in this Chinese family.
