BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC) is
associated with improved survival compared with HPV-negative disease. However, a 
minority of HPV-positive patients have poor prognosis. Currently, there is no
generally accepted strategy for identifying these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 270 consecutively treated OPSCC patients
from three centres for effects of clinical, pathological, immunological, and
molecular features on disease mortality. We used Cox regression to examine
associations between factors and OPSCC death, and developed a prognostic model
for 3-year mortality using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with HPV-positive tumours showed improved survival (hazard
ratio (HR), 0.33 (0.21-0.53)). High levels of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) stratified HPV-positive patients into high-risk and low-risk groups
(3-year survival; HPV-positive/TIL(high)=96%, HPV-positive/TIL(low)=59%).
Survival of HPV-positive/TIL(low) patients did not differ from HPV-negative
patients (HR, 1.01; P=0.98). We developed a prognostic model for HPV-positive
tumours using a 'training' cohort from one centre; the combination of TIL levels,
heavy smoking, and T-stage were significant (AUROC=0·87). This model was
validated on patients from the other centres (detection rate 67%; false-positive 
rate 5.6%; AUROC=0·82).
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that an immune response, reflected by TIL levels
in the primary tumour, has an important role in the improved survival seen in
most HPV-positive patients, and is relevant for the clinical evaluation of
HPV-positive OPSCC.
