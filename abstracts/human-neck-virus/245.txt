Giant extragenital forms of Morbus Bowen are extremely rare. The already
described cases in the word literature are most commonly with periungual
localization, as well as located on the foot and neck area. The clinical
manifestation is presented most commonly by non-specific erythematous to
erythematous-squamous plaques or papules, which is confusing to the clinician.
From the pathogenic point of view, it is important to be confirmed or rejected
the presence of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in each case of affected patient, 
as this information is mandatory in respect to the adequate selection of the
subsequent regimen. If HPVs are detected, systemic antiviral therapy could be
initiated to reduce the size of the lesions before subsequent surgical
eradication. A postoperative prevention through vaccination could be also
considered additionally. In cases of HPV-negative giant extragenital forms of
Morbus Bowen (as in the described patient), the focus should be on local
immunomodulation by substances such as imiquimod, which reduce the size of the
lesions, thereby creating optimal opportunities for their future surgical
eradication. Other possible options described in the literature include topical
application of 5-fluorouracil, photodynamic therapy, cryotherapy, and laser
therapy (carbon dioxide laser). The choice of the most appropriate regimen should
have been an individual decision of the clinician, considering also the location 
and the extent of the lesion.
