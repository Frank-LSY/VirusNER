Temporal bone Schneiderian papilloma may present as a primary tumour originating 
from the middle ear and mastoid process, or an extension from sinonasal disease. 
Both forms are rare, this being only the 18th case of primary temporal bone
Schneiderian papilloma described to date. Although the current patient has
remained disease free after excision of the papilloma, the reported recurrence
rate is high, comparable to sinonasal Schneiderian papilloma with extrasinus
extension. Malignant progression of primary Schneiderian papillomas is
significantly reduced as compared to Schneiderian papillomas that extend from the
sinonasal tract into the temporal bone. A positive human papilloma virus status, 
as found in this case, is a common feature and prognostic factor of sinonasal
Schneiderian papilloma but an infrequent finding in temporal bone disease. Owing 
to the high recurrence rate, the risk of malignant progression and the absence of
reliable prognostic markers, stringent follow-up consisting of otoscopy,
nasendoscopy and imaging is essential.
