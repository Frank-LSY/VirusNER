Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with head and neck cancers (H&NC).
Transmission of HPV to the upper aerodigestive tract occurs plausibly through
sexual contact, although epidemiologic evidence on the role of sexual behaviours 
in H&NC aetiology is inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies
examining the association between four indicators of sexual behaviours (number of
sexual partners and oral sex partners, oral sex practice, and age at first
intercourse) and H&NC. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were estimated using fixed and random effects models for each indicator,
contrasting 'highest' to 'lowest', 'ever' to 'never', or 'youngest' to 'oldest'
categories. Twenty case-control studies were included out of 3838 identified
publications. Using random effects models, summary ORs suggested an increased
risk of H&NC for number of sexual partners [OR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.02-1.63] (19
studies) and number of oral sex partners [OR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.00-2.84] (5
studies), whereas no effect was observed with oral sex practice [OR=1.09, 95% CI:
0.88-1.35] (17 studies) and age at first intercourse [OR=1.40, 95% CI: 0.71-2.79]
(6 studies). For number of sexual partners and oral sex practice, which were
assessed in more studies, we further excluded studies contributing to
heterogeneity and those not adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and alcohol
consumption. The summary ORs were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.75-1.20) for number of sexual
partners and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.84-1.26) for oral sex practice. Our findings
highlight that observed associations might be partly attributed to confounding
effects of sociodemographic and behavioural factors.
