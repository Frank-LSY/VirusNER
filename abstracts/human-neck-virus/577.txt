BACKGROUND: Identification of prognostic patient characteristics in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is of great importance. Human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive HNSCCs have favorable response to (chemo)radiotherapy. Apparent
diffusion coefficient, derived from diffusion-weighted MRI, has also shown to
predict treatment response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
correlation between HPV status and apparent diffusion coefficient.
METHODS: Seventy-three patients with histologically proven HNSCC were
retrospectively analyzed. Mean pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient was
calculated by delineation of total tumor volume on diffusion-weighted MRI. HPV
status was analyzed and correlated to apparent diffusion coefficient.
RESULTS: Six HNSCCs were HPV-positive. HPV-positive HNSCC showed significantly
lower apparent diffusion coefficient compared to HPV-negative. This correlation
was independent of other patient characteristics.
CONCLUSION: In HNSCC, positive HPV status correlates with low mean apparent
diffusion coefficient. The favorable prognostic value of low pretreatment
apparent diffusion coefficient might be partially attributed to patients with a
positive HPV status. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E613-E618,
