BACKGROUND: Pim-1 (Provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1)
belongs to the Ser/Thr kinase family and plays a pivotal role in occurrence and
development of oncogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that Pim-1
phosphorylates RUNX3 and alters its subcellular localization. However, few
studies have concerned the implications of Pim-1 in the salivary gland adenoid
cystic carcinoma (ACC). In this study, we aimed to clarify the function of Pim-1 
in ACC in vitro. Meanwhile, we measured the levels of Pim-1 and RUNX3 in the ACC 
tissues. The correlations between Pim-1/RUNX3 levels and clinical parameters were
also analyzed.
METHODS: SACC-83 and SACC-LM cells were transfected with the Pim-1 siRNA. Pim-1
mRNA and protein expression were measured using real-time PCR and immnuoblot,
respectively. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle,
apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. 
Effects of Pim-1 on cells' invasion were evaluated by transwell migration assay. 
Pim-1 and RUNX3 levels in ACC tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Pim-1 siRNA reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, causes cell
cycle arrest through cell cycle related proteins (Cyclin D1 and CDK4),
mitochondrial depolarization, and decreases invasive ability in SACC-83 and
SACC-LM cells. Pim-1 and RUNX3 levels are significantly relevant and associated
with T-stage and nerve invasion in the ACC tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the oncogenic role of Pim-1 in ACC. The
findings also suggest that Pim-1 may serve as a neoteric therapeutic target and
potential prognostic marker for ACC cancer.
