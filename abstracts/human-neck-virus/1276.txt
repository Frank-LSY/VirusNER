BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is a
major issue and none of the current diagnostic approaches is ideal. An in situ
hybridization (ISH) assay that detects high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA, called the
RNAscope HPV-test, has been recently developed. Studies have suggested that this 
assay may become a standard to define HPV-status.
METHODS: To further assess this test, we compared its performance against the
strategies that are used in routine clinical practice: p16 immunohistochemistry
(IHC) as a single test and algorithms combining p16-IHC with HPV-DNA
identification by PCR (algorithm-1) or ISH (algorithm-2).
RESULTS: 105 OPC specimens were analyzed. The prevalence of HPV-positive samples 
varied considerably: 67% for p16-IHC, 54% for algorithm-1, 61% for algorithm-2
and 59% for the RNAscope HPV-test. Discrepancies between the RNAscope HPV-test
and p16-IHC, algorithm-1 and 2 were noted in respectively 13.3%, 13.1%, and 8.6%.
The 4 diagnostic strategies were able to identify 2 groups with different
prognosis according to HPV-status, as expected. However, the greater survival
differential was observed with the RNAscope HPV-test [HR: 0.19, 95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.07-0.51, p=0.001] closely followed by algorithm-1 (HR: 0.23, 95%
CI, 0.08-0.66, p=0.006) and algorithm-2 (HR: 0.26, 95% CI, 0.1-0.65, p=0.004). In
contrast, a weaker association was found when p16-IHC was used as a single test
(HR: 0.33, 95% CI, 0.13-0.81, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the RNAscope HPV-test and p16-based
algorithms perform better that p16 alone to identify OPC that are truly driven by
HPV-infection. The RNAscope HPV-test has the advantage of being a single test.
