The goal of this study was to isolate cancer stem-like cells marked by high
expression of CD44, a putative cancer stem cell marker, from primary oral
squamous cell carcinomas and identify distinctive gene expression patterns in
these cells. From 1 October 2013 to 4 September 2015, 76 stage III-IV primary
oral squamous cell carcinoma of the gingivobuccal sulcus were resected. In all,
13 tumours were analysed by immunohistochemistry to visualise CD44-expressing
cells. Expression of CD44 within The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck Squamous
Cell Carcinoma RNA-sequencing data was also assessed. Seventy resected tumours
were dissociated into single cells and stained with antibodies to CD44 as well as
CD45 and CD31 (together referred as Lineage/Lin). From 45 of these, CD44+Lin- and
CD44-Lin- subpopulations were successfully isolated using fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting, and good-quality RNA was obtained from 14 such sorted pairs.
Libraries from five pairs were sequenced and the results analysed using
bioinformatics tools. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction was performed to experimentally validate the differential expression of 
selected candidate genes identified from the transcriptome sequencing in the same
5 and an additional 9 tumours. CD44 was expressed on the surface of poorly
differentiated tumour cells, and within the The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck
Squamous Cell Carcinoma samples, its messenger RNA levels were higher in tumours 
compared to normal. Transcriptomics revealed that 102 genes were upregulated and 
85 genes were downregulated in CD44+Lin- compared to CD44-Lin- cells in at least 
3 of the 5 tumours sequenced. The upregulated genes included those involved in
immune regulation, while the downregulated genes were enriched for genes involved
in cell adhesion. Decreased expression of PCDH18, MGP, SPARCL1 and KRTDAP was
confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lower 
expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule PCDH18 correlated with poorer
overall survival in the The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck Squamous Cell
Carcinoma data highlighting it as a potential negative prognostic factor in this 
cancer.
