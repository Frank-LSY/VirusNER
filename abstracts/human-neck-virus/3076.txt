BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a particular entity of head neck
cancer, tightly related to Epstein-Barr virus infection and thus to HLA genes. In
this study, we aimed to analyze HLA-E polymorphism in NPC advent and prognosis.
130 unrelated patients with CNP and 180 unrelated and healthy controls were
included in our study. HLA-E genotyping was performed by PCR/RFLP method; SPSS
(13.0) was used for statistical analysis, and survival curbs were established
with the "Kaplan-Meier" method (Log Rank<0.05).
RESULTS: We found a significant difference within HLA-E*103 variants between
patients and controls: E*1031 and E*1032 were associated with CNP (OR=1.613,
p=0.013 and OR=1.0809, p=0.055), and E*1033 with controls (OR=0.254, p<10(-4)).
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that HLA-E polymorphism is associated with
nasopharyngeal cancer. HLA-E expression studies could be used to understand the
implication of E*103 variants.
