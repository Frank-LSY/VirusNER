BACKGROUND: The asymmetric laterality of UV-linked skin cancer, including
melanoma and non- melanoma skin cancers has been identified. However, there seems
to be a paucity in the data correlating the laterality and presence of Merkel
cell polyoma virus (MCPyV) DNA as an aetiological factor for this phenomenon.
OBJECTIVE: To study the laterality in Finnish primary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)
patients, and compare statistically clinicopathological variables with lateral
distribution.
METHODS: Data on 171 primary MCC patients and tumour characteristics; and the
presence of MCPyV DNA or large T antigen in the tumour tissue, MCPyV copy number 
and MCC specific mortality were compared statistically against left, right or
midline presentation.
RESULTS: Fiftysix percentage of tumours presented on the left, 37% on the right
and 7% in the midline. Excluding the latter category, the left-sided excess was
60%. The excess of left-sided tumours was noted in head and neck with left-right 
ratio 3.22, face 1.5, forearm and hand 4.0 and the leg and foot 2.4. On the
trunk, tumours occurred equally on both sides. Statistically significant
difference was noted for smaller midline tumours (P < 0.0065). Left-sided tumours
associated with lower median Merkel cell polyoma virus copy number (P < 0.042)
although the trend vanished when comparing the groups separately.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed left-sided asymmetry in MCC distribution. In areas
commonly hidden form solar exposure, the occurrence was symmetrical. Detailed
aetiology of these findings remains unclear, plausible explanations include
biology of viral associated tumours or alterations in Nodal transcription factor 
pathway.
