Notes from the field: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections in employees 
of a rodent breeding facility--Indiana, May-June 2012.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In late April 2012, an infectious disease physician contacted CDC regarding a
patient with aseptic meningitis who worked at a rodent breeding facility in
Indiana. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection was suspected, and
LCMV-specific antibody was detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid from the
patient, confirming the diagnosis. LCMV is an arenavirus carried by the common
house mouse. Persons become infected through close contact with infected rodents,
through infected organ transplantation, or from mother to fetus. In
immunocompetent adults, symptoms can range from mild febrile illness to meningeal
symptoms (e.g., headache, stiff neck, or sensitivity to light). Congenitally
infected infants can have a range of severe birth defects including
hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, blindness, and mental retardation (1). Infections
in organ recipients, who are immunosuppressed, can have a case-fatality rate
approaching 90% (2).
