IMPORTANCE: The US veteran population represents a unique cohort of patients in
whom human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) has yet to be investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and characteristics of HPV-positive HNSCC
within the veteran population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective medical record review including 
patients with HNSCC diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and November 15, 2013,
from the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Data were collected between
November 16, 2013, and June 19, 2014, and analyzed between June 20, 2014, and
March 26, 2015.
EXPOSURES: Chemoradiation therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or no treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We determined HPV positivity by p16 testing.
Demographic and clinicopathologic information and overall survival were extracted
from medical records.
RESULTS: We identified 150 patients with the diagnosis of HNSCC. Sixty-nine
patients had HPV-positive tumors (46%), and 65 (43%) had HPV-negative tumors (16 
did not have HPV testing). Age at diagnosis ranged from 44 to 94 years (mean,
64.6 [SD, 8.0] years), and median (interquartile range) follow-up was 16.7
(8.7-27.3) years. Tumor location differed significantly between the 2 groups,
with an HPV-positive predominance in the oropharynx (43 of 57 [75%]; P < .001).
The HPV-positive patients were more likely to be treated primarily with combined 
chemoradiation therapy than radiation therapy or surgery (P < .001). T4 tumors
had a nearly 9 times greater rate of mortality compared with T1 tumors (HR, 8.52 
[95% CI, 2.60-18.40; P < .001); N3 disease was associated with 7.18 times greater
mortality (HR, 7.18 [95% CI, 1.99-12.26]; P < .001) compared with N1 disease; and
M1 disease was associated with 6.0 times greater mortality (HR, 5.99 [95% CI,
2.59-13.81]; P < .001). There were 42 total deaths during follow-up, 25 in the
HPV-negative group and 17 in the HPV-positive group, with a nonsignificantly
higher overall survival among HPV-positive patients independent of alcohol or
tobacco use history (P = .09).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Previous studies have found that the proportion of
HPV-positive HNSCC in the general population ranges between 20% and 75%. Although
the incidence of HPV-positive HNSCC in the Veterans Affairs population is
comparable, these patients have unique risk factors and demographic
characteristics that may suggest different prognostic factors for HPV-positive
HNSCC in this population. Nonetheless, HPV-positive tumors still seem to portend 
a better overall prognosis regardless of alcohol or tobacco history among the
Veterans Affairs population.
