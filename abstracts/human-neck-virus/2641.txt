BACKGROUND: P16 and cyclin-D1 are cell cycle proteins commonly dysregulated in
head and neck carcinoma. We assessed their expression, clinicopathological
variables, and overall survival (OS) in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: Clinical characteristics and p16 and cyclin-D1 expression were evaluated
in 101 patients with oropharyngeal SCC and 75 patients with hypopharyngeal SCC.
Associations with OS were assessed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier
analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to oropharyngeal SCC, patients with hypopharyngeal SCC were
older, men, ever-smokers with higher mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lower
p16 expression, and poorer median OS (24.8 vs 62.3 months; p < .01). In
oropharyngeal SCC, CCI (p < .001), cyclin-D1 (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.55;
p = .007), current smoking (HR = 5.72; p = .004), and former smoking (HR = 4.12; 
p = .035) were independently associated with OS. In hypopharyngeal SCC, only
nodal and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status were associated with OS.
CONCLUSION: In oropharyngeal SCC, cyclin-D1 expression is correlated with
survival, whereas smoking status and CCI may allow further stratification of
outcome.
