OBJECTIVES: Serologic analyses for anti-EBV antibodies used alone usually have
low sensitivity for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We assumed
that a combined determination of antibodies directed at EBV proteins expressed in
both lytic and latent cycles could increase the sensitivity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty healthy controls and 100 NPC patients treated with
intensity-modulated radiation therapy were recruited for the study. Serial blood 
samples of NPC patients were collected before, during and after the treatment.
The titers of antibodies directed at Rta (IgG), EA (IgG), VCA (IgA), and NA1
(IgA) were determined in duplicate by ELISA.
RESULTS: Results showed that the combined tests of EA and Rta antibodies
significantly improved the sensitivity from 89.0% for EA alone to 95%. For VCA or
NA1 in combination with the EA test, it was revealed that either the increase of 
the specificity was minimal, or the decrease of the specificity was unacceptable.
Rta, EA, VCA, and NA1 antibody titers in serial samples were followed from 53
patients of complete remission and 9 patients with recurrence or distal
metastasis post the treatment for 2 years. However, the trend of antibody titers 
of Rta, VCA or NA1 in combination with EA failed to indicate a difference between
patients with good and poor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Combined measurements of anti-Rta and anti-EA antibodies could
significantly increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis of NPC while maintain a 
high specificity.
