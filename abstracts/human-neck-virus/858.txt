BACKGROUND: Favorable outcomes for human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal 
cancer have led to interest in identifying a subgroup of patients with the lowest
risk of disease recurrence after therapy. De-intensification of therapy for this 
group may result in survival outcomes that are similar to those associated with
current therapy but with less toxicity. To advance this effort, this study
analyzed the outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with or without
systemic therapy.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with oropharyngeal cancer
treated between 1985 and 2012. The criteria for inclusion were ≤10 pack-years of 
cigarette smoking and stage III/IVA cancer limited to T1-3, N1-N2b, and T3N0
disease. A survival analysis was performed with the primary endpoint of
progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: The cohort included 857 patients. Systemic therapy was given to 439
patients (51%). The median survival was 80 months. The 2-year PFS rate was 91%.
When the analysis was limited to 324 patients irradiated without systemic
therapy, the 2- and 5-year PFS rates were 90% and 85%, respectively. Furthermore,
for these 324 patients, the 5-year PFS rates for T1, T2, and T3 disease were 90%,
83%, and 70%, respectively. The 5-year PFS rate for patients treated with
systemic therapy for T3 disease was 77% (P = .07).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the low-risk definition currently established in
cooperative trials, the patients had a 2-year PFS rate approximating 90%. When
patients who were treated with radiation alone were evaluated, no compromise was 
observed in this high rate of PFS, which is higher than the 2-year PFS thresholds
used in current cooperative trials. Cancer 2016;122:1702-7. © 2016 American
