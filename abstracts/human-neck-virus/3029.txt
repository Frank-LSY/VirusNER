OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical materials of sudden sensorineural hearing 
loss (SSNHL) in different ages of patients, and explore their clinical
characteristics and prognosis.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted by the clinical symptoms,
predisposing factors and prognosis in SSNHL patients with different ages in the
past two years (from 2008 to 2010). All patients were divided into three groups
according to age, including Group 1 (0-18 years old), Group 2 (19-59 years old), 
and Group 3 (over 60 years old).
RESULTS: Part of patients (28.1%) had a clear history of virus infection in Group
1. Some patients (18.7%) had obvious history of emotional fluctuations or fatigue
before the onset of SSNHL. Three groups of patients with "aural fullness" symptom
accounted for 3.1%, 41.3% and 29.4% respectively. The proportions of patients
with profound hearing loss in three groups were 62.5%, 40.0% and 33.3%
respectively. Most patients improved hearing level during systemic internal
medicine treatment. However, many patients (68.8%) in Group 1 showed poor
therapeutic effect.
CONCLUSIONS: SSNHL in different age stages has different clinical features. We
can improve the personalized treatment program to this disease through the
classification and grading treatment.
