OBJECTIVES: The French ENT Society (SFORL) created a workgroup to draw up
guidelines for the management of immunodeficient patients with head and neck
cancer of cutaneous origin. The present guidelines cover diagnostic and
therapeutic management and prevention of head and neck cancer of cutaneous origin
in immunodeficient patients, and in particular in transplant patients and those
with HIV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present guidelines were based on a critical
multidisciplinary reading of the literature. Immunosuppression and its varieties 
are defined. The usual risk factors for skin cancer and those specific to
immunodeficiency are presented. The prevention, assessment and management of
cutaneous carcinoma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma are dealt with. The 
level of evidence of the source studies was assessed so as to grade the various
guidelines. When need be, expert opinions are put forward.
RESULTS: Immunodeficient patients are at higher risk of head and neck skin
tumors. The level of risk depends on the type of deficiency; there is an
especially high risk of squamous cell carcinoma in transplant patients and of
Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-positive subjects. Various viruses are associated with
skin cancers. Skin tumors are often evolutive in case of immunodeficiency,
requiring rapid treatment. Management is generally the same as in immunocompetent
subjects and should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting.
Immunosuppression may need to be modulated. In organ transplant patients, the
only class of immunosuppressants with proven antitumoral efficacy are mTOR
inhibitors, particularly in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The rhythm of
clinical surveillance should be adapted according to the risk of recurrence.
Preventive measures should be undertaken.
CONCLUSION: Skin cancers in immunodeficiency are highly evolutive, requiring the 
earliest possible treatment. Immunosuppression may need modulating. As the risk
of recurrence may be elevated, careful surveillance should be implemented.
Preventive measures should also be undertaken.
