Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) strains are associated with cold
adapted, temperature sensitive and attenuated phenotypes that have been studied
in non-human or immortalized cell cultures as well as in animal models. Using a
primary, differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) culture system we
compared the replication kinetics, levels of cell-associated viral proteins and
virus particle release during infection with LAIV or the corresponding wild type 
(WT) influenza viruses. At both 33 °C and 37 °C, seasonal influenza virus and an 
antigenically matched LAIV replicated to similar titers in MDCK cells but
seasonal influenza virus replicated to higher titers than LAIV in hNEC cultures, 
suggesting a greater restriction of LAIV replication in hNEC cultures. Despite
the disparity in infectious virus production, the supernatants from H1N1 and LAIV
infected hNEC cultures had equivalent amounts of viral proteins and
hemagglutination titers, suggesting the formation of non-infectious virus
particles by LAIV in hNEC cultures.
