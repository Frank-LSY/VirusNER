AIMS: Smoking and human papillomavirus (HPV) are both distinct risk factors for
head and neck cancer, but the nature of interaction between these 2 risk factors 
in the development of head and neck cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this
review is to determine the potential effect of smoking in causation of
HPV-related head and neck carcinoma.
METHOD: A literature search was carried out using the keywords human
papillomavirus, head and neck cancer, smoking, tobacco, and cervical cancer. The 
English-language articles, references, and other relevant studies evaluating the 
association of smoking, HPV, and risk of head and neck cancer were collected and 
analyzed.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our review points to smoking tobacco posing an additional
risk for development of head and neck cancer in the presence of HPV infection.
This is consistent with available laboratory data that show evidence of
biological plausibility for interaction between smoking and progression of HPV
infection to carcinogenesis. It is therefore important that cessation of smoking 
is promoted in smokers with HPV infection.
