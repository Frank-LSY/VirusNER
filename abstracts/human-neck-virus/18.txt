Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are a group of double-stranded DNA viruses known
to be the primary cause of cervical cancer. In addition, evidence has now
established their role in non-melanoma skin cancers, head and neck cancer (HNC), 
and the development of other anogenital malignancies. The prevalence of
HPV-related HNC, in particular oropharyngeal cancers, is rapidly increasing,
foreseeing that HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers will outnumber uterine
cervical cancers in the next 15‚Åª20 years. Therefore, despite the successful
advent of vaccines originally licensed for cervical cancer prevention, HPV burden
is still very high, and a better understanding of HPV biology is urgently needed.
Autophagy is the physiological cellular route that accounts for removal,
degradation, and recycling of damaged organelles, proteins, and lipids in
lysosomal vacuoles. In addition to this scavenger function, autophagy plays a
fundamental role during viral infections and cancers and is, therefore,
frequently exploited by viruses to their own benefit. Recently, a link between
HPV and autophagy has clearly emerged, leading to the conceivable development of 
novel anti-viral strategies aimed at restraining HPV infectivity. Here, recent
findings on how oncogenic HPV16 usurp autophagy are described, highlighting
similarities and differences with mechanisms adopted by other oncoviruses.
