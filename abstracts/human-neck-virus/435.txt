Relative prevalence of HPV-driven tumors (14 HPV16, 1 HPV58) was 6% overall and 20% among oropharyngeal cancers. In the oropharynx the HPV-driven group showed a trend for better survival versus the HPV-negative group. The relative prevalence of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer is low in North-East Italy as compared to Western and Northern Europe.
