Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for cervical cancer, and its role in
head and neck carcinoma has been reported. No drug is approved for the treatment 
of HPV-related diseases but cidofovir (CDV) exhibits selective antiproliferative 
activity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of CDV-resistance (CDVR) in two 
HPV(+) (SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV) and one HPV(-) (HaCaTCDV) tumor cell lines.
Quantification of CDV metabolites and analysis of the sensitivity profile to
chemotherapeutics was performed. Transporters expression related to
multidrug-resistance (MRP2, P-gp, BCRP) was also investigated. Alterations of CDV
metabolism in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV, but not in HaCaTCDV, emerged via impairment of
UMP/CMPK1 activity. Mutations (P64T and R134M) as well as down-regulation of
UMP/CMPK1 expression were observed in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV, respectively. Altered 
transporters expression in SiHaCDV and/or HeLaCDV, but not in HaCaTCDV, was also 
noted. Taken together, these results indicate that CDVR in HPV(+) tumor cells is 
a multifactorial process.
