BACKGROUND/AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been considered a
potential risk factor for the development of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC). The purpose of the present study was to investigate HPV infection and
high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression in SCC of the oral tongue in 53 Greek
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three biopsies were collected from patients with SCC
of the oral tongue and tested for HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA expression.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 11.3% (6/53), while high-risk HPV 
DNA was found in 7.5% (4/53) of SCC of the oral tongue. E6/E7 mRNA expression was
observed in 9.4% (5/53) samples examined. HPV 16 was the commonest genotype
identified by both DNA and RNA assays. A total of 28.3% (15/53) of the patients
were non-smokers and non-drinkers. HPV infection was strongly associated with
abstinence from tobacco and alcohol (p=0.013).
CONCLUSION: The presence of high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression suggests that HPV
may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SCC of the oral tongue.
