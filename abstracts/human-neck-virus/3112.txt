Dizziness and hearing loss are among the most common disabilities. Many forms of 
hereditary balance and hearing disorders are caused by abnormal development of
stereocilia, mechanosensory organelles on the apical surface of hair cells in the
inner ear. The deaf whirler mouse, a model of human Usher syndrome (manifested by
hearing loss, dizziness, and blindness), has a recessive mutation in the whirlin 
gene, which renders hair cell stereocilia short and dysfunctional. In this study,
wild-type whirlin cDNA was delivered to the inner ears of neonatal whirler mice
using adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 (AAV8-whirlin) by injection into the
posterior semicircular canal. Unilateral whirlin gene therapy injection was able 
to restore balance function as well as improve hearing in whirler mice for at
least 4 months. Our data indicate that gene therapy is likely to become a
treatment option for hereditary disorders of balance and hearing.
