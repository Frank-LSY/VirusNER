OBJECTIVES: Basaloid-squamous-carcinomas (BSCC) have been considered as
aggressive variants of common squamous-cell-carcinomas (HNSCC). Recent studies
demonstrated a different clinical course depending on the tumour site. The aim of
the study is to analyze the histopathologic/clinical features of BSCC/HNSCC
resolved by the HPV-status.
METHODS: We analysed the histopathologic/clinical features of BSCC (n=59) and
HNSCC (n=981), subdivided due to the HPV status. Differences were analysed using 
Chi square, Fisher exact, and student's t-test. Survival rates were calculated by
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. Prognostic variables were subsequently evaluated 
by Cox regression.
RESULTS: Our cohort was congruent with the literature regarding sex, age,
metastases, and a predilection in the oropharynx. HNSCC/BSCC did not show a
different disease-specific-survival. After UICC matching, univariate analysis
revealed a better survival of UICC stage IVa BSCC compared to HNSCC (69% vs. 42%,
p=0.022) that was associated with a better response to radio-chemotherapy (p =
0.009). These results referred to the high prevalence of HPV+ (86%) oropharyngeal
BSCC. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a better survival of HPV+ oropharyngeal BSCC
than HPV- BSCC (p=0.017).
CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome in BSCC depends on the tumour site and
HPV-status. Prospective studies have to evaluate the beneficial application of
postoperative radio-chemotherapy in HPV+ BSCC.
