Mumps virus occasionally causes bilateral hearing loss. We report 4 cases of
bilateral mumps deafness in whom cochlear implantations (CI) were performed. The 
age at the onset of hearing loss was 1-9 years. CI surgery was performed within 6
months from the onset of hearing loss in 3 cases and after 9 years in the other
case, showing good speech perception in the early intervention cases and a poor
outcome after later implantation. Early CI surgery is highly recommended in
sudden onset deafness by mumps in childhood.
