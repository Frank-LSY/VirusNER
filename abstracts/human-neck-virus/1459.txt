Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy that is invasive and
metastasizes easily. In several Asian countries it is the most commonly found of 
the head and neck malignancies. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is one of the 
agents causing NPC, so that expression of LMP1 and LMP2 may affect the outcome of
therapy, metastasis, recurrence, and survival of NPC patients. This study aimed
to investigate their expression in relation to therapy outcome and survival in a 
series of Indonesian NPC patients. The methods used were nested case control and 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Differences in therapy outcome in relation to
LMP1 and LMP2 expression were analyzed through chi square statistics. As a
result, in post treatment NPC, there was a significant difference in therapy
outcome between LMP2+ compared to LMP2⁻ (P = 0.001). There was also a significant
difference in 24-months-survival between NPCs expressing LMP1+ or LMP2+ compared 
to those expressing LMP1⁻ or LMP2⁻.
