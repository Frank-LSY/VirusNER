PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked with a subset of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HPV-positive HNSCCs show a better prognosis
than HPV-negative HNSCCs, which may be explained by sensitivity of the
HPV-positive HNSCCs to ionizing radiation (IR). Although the molecular mechanism 
behind sensitivity to IR in HPV-positive HNSCCs is unresolved, DNA damage
response (DDR) might be a significant determinant of IR sensitivity. An important
player in the DDR, SMG-1 (suppressor with morphogenetic effect on genitalia), is 
a potential tumor suppressor and may therefore be deregulated in cancer. No
studies have yet been conducted linking defects in SMG-1 expression with cancer. 
We investigated whether deregulation of SMG-1 could be responsible for defects in
the DDR in oropharyngeal HNSCC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression and promoter methylation status of SMG-1 were
investigated in HNSCCs. To identify a functional link between HPV infection and
SMG-1, we transfected the HPV-negative cells with an E6/E7 expression construct. 
SMG-1 short hairpin RNAs were expressed in HPV-negative cells to estimate
survival upon IR.
RESULTS: Forced E6/E7 expression in HPV-negative cells resulted in SMG-1 promoter
hypermethylation and decreased SMG-1 expression. Due to promoter
hypermethylation, HPV-positive HNSCC cells and tumors express SMG-1 at lower
levels than HPV-negative SCCs. Depletion of SMG-1 in HPV-negative HNSCC cells
resulted in increased radiation sensitivity, whereas SMG-1 overexpression
protected HPV-positive tumor cells from irradiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of SMG-1 expression negatively correlated with HPV status in 
cancer cell lines and tumors. Diminished SMG-1 expression may contribute to the
enhanced response to therapy exhibited by HPV-positive HNSCCs.
