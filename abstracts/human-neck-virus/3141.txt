BACKGROUND & AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for low bone
mineral density (BMD) in persons co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C.
METHODS: HIV/HCV co-infected study participants (n=179) were recruited into a
prospective cohort and underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) within 1 
year of a liver biopsy. Fibrosis staging was evaluated according to the METAVIR
system. Osteoporosis was defined as a T-score ≤-2.5. Z-scores at the total hip,
femoral neck, and lumbar spine were used as the primary outcome variables to
assess the association between degree of liver disease, HIV-related variables,
and BMD.
RESULTS: The population was 65% male, 85% Black with mean age 50.3 years. The
prevalence of osteoporosis either at the total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine
was 28%, with 5% having osteoporosis of the total hip, 6% at the femoral neck,
25% at the spine. The mean Z-scores (standard deviation) were -0.42 (1.01) at the
total hip, -0.16 (1.05) at the femoral neck, and -0.82 (1.55) at the lumbar
spine. In multivariable models, controlled HIV replication (HIV RNA <400
copies/ml vs. ≥400 copies/ml) was associated with lower Z-scores (mean ± standard
error) at the total hip (-0.44 ± 0.17, p = 0.01), femoral neck (-0.59 ± 0.18, p =
0.001), and the spine (-0.98 ± 0.27, p = 0.0005). There was no association
between degree of liver fibrosis and Z-score.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis was very common in this population of predominately
African-American HIV/HCV co-infected patients, particularly at the spine. Lower
BMD was associated with controlled HIV replication, but not liver disease
severity.
