It is well known that patients with HIV are prone to diabetes mellitus because of
the side effects of HARRT. However, whether high glucose affects the HIV
infection of T cells is not clear. Recent studies have shown that upregulation of
GLUT-1 renders T cells susceptible to HIV infection. We hypothesized that
hyperglycemia has the potential to increase HIV infection by enhancing its entry 
into immune cells. The effect of high glucose on HIV entry into T cells (Jurkat
cells and PBMCs) and the mechanisms involved were investigated. High glucose
significantly enhanced HIV entry, which was associated with increased T-cell
expression of CXCR4. However, T cells with silenced HIF-1α displayed attenuated
expression of CXCR4, whereas T cells with silenced CXCR4 showed decreased HIV
entry in a high-glucose milieu. On the one hand, high glucose stimulated T-cell
ROS generation, and H(2)O(2) at low concentrations enhanced the entry of HIV into
T cells. On the other hand, inhibition of ROS not only attenuated
high-glucose-mediated T-cell expression of CXCR4 and HIF-1α but also mitigated
T-cell HIV entry in a high-glucose milieu. In our study, high glucose enhanced
HIV entry into T cells by increasing expression of CXCR4 and HIF-1α.
