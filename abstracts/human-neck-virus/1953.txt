Among all head and neck (H&N) cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) represents 
a distinct entity regarding epidemiology, clinical presentation, biological
markers, carcinogenic risk factors, and prognostic factors. NPC is endemic in
certain regions of the world, especially in Southeast Asia, and has a poor
prognosis. In Indonesia, the recorded mean prevalence is 6.2/100 000, with 13 000
yearly new NPC cases, but otherwise little is documented on NPC in Indonesia.
Here, we report on a group of 1121 NPC patients diagnosed and treated at Dr.
Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia between 1996 and 2005. We studied
NPC incidence among all H&N cancer cases (n=6000) observed in that period,
focusing on age and gender distribution, the ethnic background of patients, and
the disease etiology. We also analyzed most prevalent signs and symptoms and
staging of NPC patients at first presentation. In this study population, NPC was 
the most frequent H&N cancer (28.4%), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.4, and was
endemic in the Javanese population. Interestingly, NPC appeared to affect
patients at a relatively young age (20% juvenile cases) without a bimodal age
distribution. Mostly, NPC initiated in the fossa of Rosenmuller and spreaded
intracranially or locally as a mass in the head. Occasionally, NPC developed at
the submucosal level spreading outside the anatomic limits of the nasopharynx. At
presentation, NPC associated with hearing problems, serous otitis media,
tinnitus, nasal obstruction, anosmia, bleeding, difficulty in swallowing and
dysphonia, and even eye symptoms with diplopia and pain. The initial diagnosis is
difficult to make because early signs and symptoms of NPC are not specific to the
disease. Early-age Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection combined with frequent
exposure to environmental carcinogenic co-factors is suggested to cause NPC
development. Undifferentiated NPC is the most frequent histological type and is
closely associated with EBV. Expression of the EBV-encoded latent membrane
protein 1(LMP1) oncogene in biopsy material was compared between NPC patients of 
<30 years old and those of â‰¥30 years old, matched for sex and tumor stage. Higher
LMP1 expression in patients of <30 years old was observed, which was related to
more locoregional progressivity. Increased medical awareness of prevailing early 
stage signs and symptoms coupled to use of EBV-related diagnostic tumor markers
may lead to down-staging and timely treatment to improve survival of patients
with this aggressive disease.
