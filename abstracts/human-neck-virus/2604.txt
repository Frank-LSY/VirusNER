The ESCRT proteins are an ancient system that buds membranes and severs membrane 
necks from their inner face. Three "classical" functions of the ESCRTs have
dominated research into these proteins since their discovery in 2001: the
biogenesis of multivesicular bodies in endolysosomal sorting; the budding of
HIV-1 and other viruses from the plasma membrane of infected cells; and the
membrane abscission step in cytokinesis. The past few years have seen an
explosion of novel functions: the biogenesis of microvesicles and exosomes;
plasma membrane wound repair; neuron pruning; extraction of defective nuclear
pore complexes; nuclear envelope reformation; plus-stranded RNA virus replication
compartment formation; and micro- and macroautophagy. Most, and perhaps all, of
the functions involve the conserved membrane-neck-directed activities of the
ESCRTs, revealing a remarkably widespread role for this machinery through a broad
swath of cell biology.
