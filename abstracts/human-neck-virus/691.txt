Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
is a unique form of carcinoma that largely arises from the tonsillar tissue in
the oropharynx. These tumors often present with cervical lymphadenopathy
resulting in a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Use of the cytology specimen 
to determine the HPV-status has significant prognostic and treatment implications
as HPV-related tumors have a more favorable prognosis and response to nonsurgical
therapies. While several different ancillary testing methods are available that
have proven effective for determining HPV status in FNA specimens from HNSCCs,
there is currently no consensus regarding HPV testing in this setting. Diagn.
