INTRODUCTION: Tonsil cancer (TC) is a type of head and neck cancer (HNC) that is 
predominantly associated with infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). In
Denmark, the incidence of HPV-related HNC has increased fivefold over the past
three decades. HNC more often affects men than women, and HPV-related HNC tends
to affect younger age groups than other HNCs. The present study examined the
long-term health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with TC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A medical anthropological approach was applied using
individual qualitative interviews with seven former TC patients. The participants
included men and women who had undergone various treatments, i.e. radiation
therapy, chemotherapy and operation. Data were analyzed using a narrative
methodology.
RESULTS: Treatment sequelae peaked within the first three months and included
severe pain in the radiated area, nausea and fatigue. Within this period,
patients were unable to eat solid food and often had difficulty speaking. Half of
the participants lost some of their hearing due to radiation. Even two years
after treatment, most participants had persisting sequelae, mainly xerostomia,
porous teeth and reduced mobility of the tongue and jaw. Fatigue and difficulties
eating and communicating, in particular, had a very negative effect on the
participants' psycho-social QoL.
CONCLUSION: This study allowed for a deeper understanding of the negative effects
of HNC on patients' QoL. These QoL effects ought to be included in future
considerations of HPV vaccination of boys as well as girls.
FUNDING: The study was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Sanofi
Pasteur MSD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.
