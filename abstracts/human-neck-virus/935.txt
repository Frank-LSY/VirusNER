Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(HPV-OSCC) represents a specific clinical and pathological entity among head and 
neck cancers with more favorable prognosis than corresponding HPV-negative
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). HPV-OSCC most commonly displays
non-keratinzing SCC histology, although number of cases presented variable
morphology. Detection of transcriptionally active HPV in oropharyngeal SCCs is of
critical prognostic importance, which even supersedes the importance of their
formal pathological grading. This article summarizes the current state of
knowledge of HPV-positive SCC of oropharynx and of other anatomical subsites of
the head and neck and discusses the role of HPV detection in the diagnostics of
metastatic SCC lesions of unknown origin.
