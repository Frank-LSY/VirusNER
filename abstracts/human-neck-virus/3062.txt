BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis occurs in patients undergoing chemoradiation for
cancer treatment. It is believed that colonization of ulcerated mucosa by
bacteria, fungi, and virus results in secondary infections. The effect of
chlorhexidine on the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in patients with
cancer was evaluated in this review.
METHODS: Studies were limited to randomized placebo-controlled trials. Three
databases were searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library up to May 25, 2016.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight abstracts were evaluated by three independent reviewers.
Twelve studies met the criteria for inclusion. Four of these studies were
assessed at unclear risk of bias and eight of them at high risk. Of the 12
studies, nine were included in two meta-analyses. Pooled results showed that
chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce incidence of mucositis compared to
placebo (P = 0.129), nor chlorhexidine did significantly reduce the severity of
mucositis (P = 0.127), although subgroup analysis in the chemotherapy group
showed a trend toward significance (P = 0.054). Side effects reported in the
included studies were teeth staining and altered taste perception.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found that chlorhexidine is not significantly
effective in reducing the severity of mucositis (moderate quality of evidence)
nor in preventing the incidence of mucositis (low quality of evidence). However, 
more studies are needed in patients receiving chemotherapy only, as a positive
trend toward significance was found (P = 0.054).
