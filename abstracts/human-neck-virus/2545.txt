PURPOSE: A complete economic evaluation requires accurate data concerning the
resources used, outcomes, and utilities (patient's preferences) to properly value
the cost utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination strategies. This study
was designed to measure the utility loss in health states affected by a broad
range of HPV-induced pathologies in both sexes in Italy. As a secondary
objective, risk factors influencing the viral transmission and development of HPV
infections were also investigated.
METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of several HPV-induced pathologies including
atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical and anal-colorectal cancer, head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and anogenital warts (AWs) were evaluated.
Utilities, quality of life, and risk factors were elicited using a standardized
and computer-guided administration of time trade-off, European Quality of Life 5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D), 3 levels, and risk factor questionnaires. Utilities were
measured at 6 clinical research centers across Italy. A group of healthy subjects
was used as a control. A mean number of 20 healthy subjects was used as a control
for each pathology group.
FINDINGS: Overall, 600 respondents were eligible for analysis: 465 patients (mean
[SD] age, 44.0 [16.3] years) and 135 controls (mean [SD] age, 44.0 [13.2] years).
With the exception of anal and HNSCC cancer, no statistically significant
differences were observed between case and control groups, in terms of either age
or quality of life at the time of interview. The patients' perception of their
health condition at baseline was equal to an EQ-5D score of 0.87 (0.22). The mean
(SD) value of utilities associated with the HPV-induced pathologies corresponded 
to 0.83 (0.24), 0.78 (0.27), 0.83 (0.22), 0.81 (0.27), 0.58 (0.31), 0.51 (0.26), 
and 0.69 (0.30) for ASC-US, AWs, CIN 1 (mild), CIN 2-3 (moderate to severe),
cervical cancer, anal cancer and HNSCC, respectively. Utility lost due to AWs was
significantly higher in females compared with males (0.71 [0.29] vs 0.83 [0.25]; 
P = 0.018). Having >5 sexual partners increased the risk of acquiring HPV-induced
infections as much as 2.52-fold (P = 0.004), whereas for smoking or the age at
start of sexual activity younger than 18 years, the risk increased by ~1.62-fold 
(P = 0.034). High levels of education were associated with a statistically
significant protective effect (P < 0.001).
IMPLICATIONS: Risk factors and utilities elicited in this study can be used as
part of future economic assessments of other HPV vaccination strategies,
including an immunization program for preadolescents of both sexes in Italy.
