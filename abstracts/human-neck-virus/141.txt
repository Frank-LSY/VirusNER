Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the etiological factors of many benign and
malignant lesions localized in the skin and mucous membranes in the region of the
urogenital organs and head and neck. Currently, most assays for the detection of 
HPV are based on detecting the presence of viral nucleic acids, mostly viral DNA.
These molecular techniques can be divided into: 1) methods based on a targeted,
selective amplification of nucleic acids, 2) signal amplification methods, 3)
nucleic acid hybridization assays. This paper presents and explains a number of
different HPV detection methods and provides examples of some commonly available 
commercial tests.
