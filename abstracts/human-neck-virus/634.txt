OBJECTIVE: To detect the infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 in
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and explore the relationship 
between HPV infection and expressions of Ki-67 and P53 proteins in tumor tissue.
METHOD: The level of HPV 16/18 DNA was measured by real time polymerase chain
reaction, and Ki-67 and P53 proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry in
tissues from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: HPV 16/18 DNA was detected in 62.8% of our patients. In each cancer
tissue sample, Ki-67 protein was expressed between 2% to 70%. P53 protein was
expressed in 46.15% of our patients. No significant relation was found between
HPV 16/18 DNA level and sex, smoking, drinking, and tumor clinical stages.
However, level of HPV 16/18 DNA was found to have positive relation with tumor
pathological grades and negative relation with P53 protein expression. No
relation with Ki-67 protein expression was found.
CONCLUSION: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may be initiated by HPV 16/18
infection and the mechanism in carcinogenesis involves abnormal expression in P53
protein.
