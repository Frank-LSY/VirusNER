Of the 136 patients identified with DNI, 20 (15%) were IDUs; of them 80% were males. IDUs were significantly younger than non-IDUs (mean age, 35 ± 10 vs. 44 ± 16 years, P = .01). All IDUs had multiple comorbidities. IDUs presented for medical examination and hospitalization later in the course of their disease, and the most common involved neck spaces were consistent with areas where cervical injections are commonly performed. Abscess formation was more common in IDUs than non-IDUs (16 [80%] vs. 79 [68%], respectively, P = .04). Despite later presentation of IDUs and their higher rate of comorbidities, laboratory data, microbiology cultures, and disease course were similar to non-IDUs.
