The microbiome is fundamentally one of the most unique organs in the human body. 
Dysbiosis can result in critical inflammatory responses and result in
pathogenesis contributing to neoplastic events. We used a pan-pathogen array
technology (PathoChip) coupled with next-generation sequencing to establish
microbial signatures unique to human oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas (OCSCC/OPSCC). Signatures for DNA and RNA viruses including oncogenic 
viruses, gram positive and negative bacteria, fungi and parasites were detected. 
Cluster and topological analyses identified 2 distinct groups of microbial
signatures related to OCSCCs/OPSCCs. Results were validated by probe capture next
generation sequencing; the data from which also provided a comprehensive map of
integration sites and chromosomal hotspots for micro-organism genomic insertions.
Identification of these microbial signatures and their integration sites may
provide biomarkers for OCSCC/OPSCC diagnosis and prognosis as well as novel
avenues for study of their potential role in OCSCCs/OPSCCs.
