Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer
worldwide. The most common risk factors are carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol), and
infection of the human papilloma virus. Surgery is still considered as the
treatment of choice in case of head and neck cancer, followed by a reconstructive
surgery to enhance the quality of life in the patients. However, the widespread
use of artificial implants does not provide appropriate physiological activities 
and often cannot act as a long-term solution for the patients. Here we review the
applicability of multiple stem cell types for tissue engineering of cartilage,
trachea, vocal folds and nerves for head and neck injuries. The ability of the
cells to self-renew and maintain their pluripotency state makes them an
attractive tool in tissue engineering.
