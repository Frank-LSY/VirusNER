Recent studies showed that human papillomavirus (HPV) integration contributes to 
the genomic instability seen in HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HPV-HNSCC). However, the epigenetic alterations induced after HPV
integration remains unclear. To identify the molecular details of HPV16 DNA
integration and the ensuing patterns of methylation in HNSCC, we performed
next-generation sequencing using a target-enrichment method for the effective
identification of HPV16 integration breakpoints as well as the characterization
of genomic sequences adjacent to HPV16 integration breakpoints with three
HPV16-related HNSCC cell lines. The DNA methylation levels of the integrated
HPV16 genome and that of the adjacent human genome were also analyzed by
bisulfite pyrosequencing. We found various integration loci, including novel
integration sites. Integration loci were located predominantly in the intergenic 
region, with a significant enrichment of the microhomologous sequences between
the human and HPV16 genomes at the integration breakpoints. Furthermore, various 
levels of methylation within both the human genome and the integrated HPV genome 
at the integration breakpoints in each integrant were observed. Allele-specific
methylation analysis suggested that the HPV16 integrants remained hypomethylated 
when the flanking host genome was hypomethylated. After integration into highly
methylated human genome regions, however, the HPV16 DNA became methylated. In
conclusion, we found novel integration sites and methylation patterns in
HPV-HNSCC using our unique method. These findings may provide insights into
understanding of viral integration mechanism and virus-associated carcinogenesis 
of HPV-HNSCC.
