OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and genotype
distribution of single and multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) in a Mexican population and to assess 
their associations with smoking and drinking habits and clinicopathologic
characteristics.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of patients
diagnosed with HNSCCs. Tumor DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction
with HPV consensus and multiplex primers. The associations among HPV status,
survival, and clinical characteristics were analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixteen of the 43 HNSCCs were HPV positive. HPV16 was the most prevalent
type, with single infections present in 5 cases, whereas another 5 cases were
combined with HPV56 infection. There was a significant association between HPV
infection and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV positivity was associated with overall
survival at a nearly significant P level of 0.06.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the importance of HPV infection in oropharyngeal
cancer, with a trend toward higher survival in HPV-positive cases.
