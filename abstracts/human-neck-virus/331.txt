BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a basic risk factor for head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Little knowledge exists about the impact of HPV 
on clinical diagnostic and therapy of patients with HNSCC.
METHODS: We evaluated the evidence of HPV16 in 131 retrospectively collected
HNSCC and associated cervical lymph node metastases by HPV16 real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and p16 immunohistochemistry and its impact on
clinicopathological characteristics.
RESULTS: HPV16-DNA and p16 overexpression were present in 27% of HNSCCs. All
cervical lymph node metastases of HPV16-positive HNSCC showed HPV16-DNA. HPV16
was strongly associated with tumors arising from the oropharyngeal site (p <
.000001), favorable outcome after standard therapy in univariate (p = .001) and
multivariate (p = .0004) analysis, and cervical lymph node metastases before
primary detection.
CONCLUSION: HPV16-diagnostic in cervical lymph node metastases can predict the
site of tumor origin in case of carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) and favorable 
outcome and should, therefore, be included in routine diagnostic workup.
