INTRODUCTION: Low and middle income countries (LMICs) bear more than 50% of the
current cervical cancer burden over the last decade with linkages to lack of HPV 
vaccination, high levels of poverty, illiteracy and nonexistent or poor screening
programs. Governments of LMICs need enough convincing evidence that HPV
vaccination will be more cost-effective in reducing the scourge of cervical
cancer. Area covered: A systematic review to identify suitable studies from
MEDLINE(via PubMed), EMBASE and Electronic search through GOOGLE for original and
review articles from 2007 to 2014 on cost-effectiveness of human papilloma virus 
vaccination of pre-adolescent girls in LMICs was conducted. A total of 19 full
articles were finally selected and reviewed after screening out those not
consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Expert commentary: Most
studies on cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine in LMICs show that lowering cost of 
HPV vaccination with or without Pap smear screening is cost-effective in areas
with high incidence of cervical cancer.
