PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to examine the effect of tobacco use on
disease recurrence (local/regional recurrence, distant metastasis, or second
primary) among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) following a complete response to
chemoradiation therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Between 1999 and 2007, 124 patients with advanced SCCOP (86%
with stage IV) and adequate tumor tissue for HPV analysis who were enrolled in
one of two consecutive University of Michigan treatment protocols were
prospectively included in this study. Patients were categorized as never-,
former, or current tobacco users. The primary end points were risk of disease
recurrence and time to recurrence; secondary end points were disease-specific
survival and overall survival.
RESULTS: One hundred and two patients (82.3%) had HPV-positive tumors. Over two
thirds (68%) of patients with HPV-positive tumors were tobacco users. Among
HPV-positive patients, current tobacco users were at significantly higher risk of
disease recurrence than never-tobacco users (hazard ratio, 5.2; confidence
interval, 1.1-24.4; P = 0.038). Thirty-five percent of HPV-positive ever tobacco 
users recurred compared with only 6% of HPV-positive never users and 50% of
HPV-negative patients. All HPV-negative patients were tobacco users and had
significantly shorter times to recurrence (P = 0.002), and had reduced
disease-specific survival (P = 0.004) and overall survival (P < 0.001) compared
with HPV-positive patients. Compared with HPV-positive never-tobacco users, those
with a tobacco history showed a trend for reduced disease-specific survival (P = 
0.064) but not overall survival (P = 0.221).
CONCLUSIONS: Current tobacco users with advanced, HPV-positive SCCOP are at
higher risk of disease recurrence compared with never-tobacco users.
