BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth-factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays a key role in
the development of cancer and is important for the regulation of tissue growth,
predominantly via the growth hormone (GH). Targeting IGF-1R is a current topic of
cancer research. The aim of this study was to identify IGF-1R in undifferentiated
carcinomas of the head and neck.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens
from 20 patients with undifferentiated carcinomas were investigated. IGF-1R was
detected immunohistochemically. In some cases, the infection status for Einstein 
Barr virus (EBV, DNA) or HPV (RNA) was known.
RESULTS: IGF-1R was detected in all tumours, regardless of differentiation or
proof of EBV or HPV integration into the genome.
DISCUSSION: This study revealed a broad expression of IGF-1R in undifferentiated 
carcinomas of the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal region, both in primaries and 
regional lymph nodes. These results suggest that IGF-1R expression in these
tumours is capable of transmitting mitogenic signals to the neoplastic cells. The
presence of IGF-1R in undifferentiated carcinomas suggests that these tumours can
respond to IGF. Targeting this receptor may be a promising tool for the treatment
of advanced stage NPC.
