Since 2008, a new polyomavirus (MCPyV) in Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC) has been
described, but little is known about its impact on the clinical course. The
purpose of this study was to determine the presence of MCPyV in a large sample
and to correlate the results with the clinical course of the disease. 59 samples 
from 44 patients were analysed for the presence of MCPyV using the primers LT3,
VP1 and LT1. The clinical records of these patients were evaluated and correlated
with the presence of MCPyV. 58% of specimens were positive for MCPyV. Of these,
LT3 was positive in 53%, VP1 in 37% and LT1 in 10%. 57% of primary tumours and
53% of metastases were positive for LT3; the numbers for VP1 and LT1 were lower. 
There was no correlation between the detection of MCPyV in the primary tumour and
the appearance of metastases. The survival time was statistically independent
from the presence of MCPyV. There is a striking occurrence of MCPyV in MCC, but
whether it affects the clinical course remains unclear.
