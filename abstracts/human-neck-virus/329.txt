PURPOSE: Oral mucositis (OM) is a frequent side effect resulting from
antineoplastic treatment and is described as an acute alteration characterized by
ulcerative lesions, with the presence of a persistent chronic inflammatory
infiltrate, erythema, and pain.
AIMS: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the presence of the herpes simplex
virus (HSV-1/2) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
region (SCC) and its influence on the aggravation of oral mucositis after
radiotherapy or radio/chemotherapy treatment.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 91 patients were evaluated with regard
to their serological status for IgG before treatment (initial time interval--TI) 
and for IgM before treatment (T1) and on the 30th day after the first day of
radiotherapy application/radiation therapy (final time interval--TF), using
immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA), and the results were correlated with the intensity
of OM.
RESULTS: The seroprevalence for IgG was 97.8 %. IgM (TI) was positive in 18.7%
and IgM (TF) in 20.9% of patients. All the patients developed some degree of oral
mucositis; however, there was statistically significant correlation between
positivity for IgM and degree of severity of OM, irrespective of the type of
treatment to which the patient was submitted.
CONCLUSION: The reactivation of HSV-1/2 was shown to be relatively infrequent and
there was no correlation between presence of the virus and aggravation of oral
mucositis resulting from antineoplastic treatment.
