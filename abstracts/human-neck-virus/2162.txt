In solid tumors, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells must overcome
the challenges of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized
that pre-treating tumors with our binary oncolytic adenovirus (CAd), which
produces local oncolysis and expresses immunostimulatory molecules, would enhance
the antitumor activity of HER2-specific CAR T cells, which alone are insufficient
to cure solid tumors. We tested multiple cytokines in conjunction with
PD-L1-blocking antibody and found that Ad-derived IL-12p70 prevents the loss of
HER2.CAR-expressing T cells at the tumor site. Accordingly, we created a
construct encoding the PD-L1-blocking antibody and IL-12p70 (CAd12_PDL1). In head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft models, combining local
treatment with CAd12_PDL1 and systemic HER2.CAR T cell infusion improved survival
to >100 days compared with approximately 25 days with either approach alone. This
combination also controlled both primary and metastasized tumors in an orthotopic
model of HNSCC. Overall, our data show that CAd12_PDL1 augments the anti-tumor
effects of HER2.CAR T cells, thus controlling the growth of both primary and
metastasized tumors.
