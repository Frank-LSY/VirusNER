BACKGROUND: Recent advances in understanding complex tumor interactions have led 
to the discovery of an association between inflammation and cancer, in particular
for colon and lung cancer, but only a very few have dealt with oral cancer.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the significance of
preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a parameter for development of
lymph node metastases or recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 278 patients with oral cancer, preoperative CRP levels 
were compared with development of recurrence and metastasis.
RESULTS: In 27 patients from the normal CRP group, and in 21 patients from the
elevated CRP group, local recurrence was observed. Concerning lymph node
metastases, 37 patients were in the normal group and 9 patients in the elevated
CRP group. No significant correlation could be found between elevated CRP levels 
and metastasis (p = 0.468) or recurrence (p = 0.137).
CONCLUSION: Our findings do not appear to support a correlation between
preoperative CRP levels and development of recurrence or metastases. In further
studies, CRP levels in precancerous lesions and in Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
positive patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be studied.
