AIMS: Expression profiles and clinical impact of programmed cell death ligand 1
(PD-L1) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expressing tumour infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are not
elucidated fully. This study evaluates expression patterns in primary HNSCC and
related lymph node metastasis and the impact on patients' clinical outcome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining patterns of PD-L1 and PD-1 were
evaluated in 129 specimens of primary HNSCC and 77 lymph node metastases. Results
were correlated with patients' clinical data. PD-L1 expression was observed in
36% of primary carcinoma and 33% of lymph node metastasis, and correlates
significantly with decreased overall survival (OS) (P = 0.01) and disease-free
survival (DFS) (P = 0.001) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients. PD-L1
expression was associated with presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0223).
Infiltration of PD-1-expressing lymphocytes correlates significantly with
favourable OS (P = 0.001) and DFS (P = 0.001) in oropharyngeal cancer and
hypopharyngeal cancer patients OS (P = 0.007) and DFS (P = 0.001). Presence of
PD-1 TILs also correlates significantly with better OS (P = 0.005) and DFS (P =
0) in the human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cohort. Cox regression
multivariate analysis revealed PD-1 TIL expression as an independent prognostic
marker for OS (P = 0.004) and DFS (P = 0.001) and T stage was validated as
negative prognostic marker for OS (P = 0.011). PD-1-expressing lymphocytes (P =
0.0412) and PD-L1 expression (P = 0.0022) patterns correlate significantly in
primary cancers and matched lymph node metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results characterise the expression profiles of PD-1 axis
proteins in HNSCC which might serve as possible clinical prognostic markers.
