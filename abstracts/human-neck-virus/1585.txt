A Comparison of Clinical Outcomes Between HPV Positive and HPV Negative Squamous 
Cell Carcinomas of the Oropharynx.

Sanders E.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is now recognized as a major risk factor
for the development of oropharyngeal head and neck cancers, specifically HPV type
16. HPV-16 positive oropharyngeal cancer may in fact represent a distinct disease
entity which is associated with improved prognosis and survival (National Cancer 
Institute, 2016). In this study, we examined the characteristics of patients with
early stage HPV-16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and their
post-operative course contrasting the findings to patients with HPV-16 negative
tumors. Overall, it was noted that 30-day readmissions and surgical site
infections are not affected by the HPV status of the tumor. Robotic surgery is
used more frequently with patients who were positive for the HPV infection, and
the data suggest that there is a trend toward shorter length of hospital stays as
well as a difference in postoperative complications.
