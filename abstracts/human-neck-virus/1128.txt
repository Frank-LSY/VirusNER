BACKGROUND: Pretreatment body mass index (BMI) >25kg/m(2) is a positive
prognostic factor in patients with head and neck cancer. Previous studies have
not been adequately stratified by human papilloma virus (HPV) status or subsite. 
Our objective is to determine prognostic significance of pretreatment BMI on
overall survival in HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients with HPV+ OPSCC treated
between 8/1/2006 and 8/31/2014. Patients were stratified by BMI status
(>/<25kg/m(2)). Univariate and multivariate analyses of survival were performed.
RESULTS: 300 patients met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients with a BMI
>25kg/m(2) had a longer overall survival (HR=0.49, P=0.01) as well as a longer
disease-specific survival (HR=0.43, P=0.02). Overall survival remained
significantly associated with high BMI on multivariate analysis (HR=0.54,
P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment normal or underweight BMI status is associated with
worse overall survival in HPV+ OPSCC.
