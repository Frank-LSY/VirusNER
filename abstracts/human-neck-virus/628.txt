BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cases of squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a much better disease outcome compared to SCCHN
cases lacking HPV. Differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression may affect their
clinical outcomes.
METHODS: The miRNA expression was studied using microarrays and quantitative
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in HPV-16-positive and
HPV-negative SCCHN cell lines. The role of HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes in altering
miRNA expression was investigated using human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs).
RESULTS: The miRNAs miR-363, miR-33, and miR-497 were upregulated, whereas
miR-155, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-29a, miR-218, miR-222, miR-221, and miR-142-5p
were downregulated in HPV-positive cells compared to both HPV-negative SCCHN and 
normal oral keratinocytes. HPV-16 E6 oncogene altered miRNA expression in HFKs
and in an HPV-16-positive cell line with E6 knockdown using siRNA.
CONCLUSION: miRNAs differentially expressed in the presence of HPV-16 may provide
biomarkers for SCCHN and identify cellular pathways targeted by this virus.
