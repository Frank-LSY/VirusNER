Supraglottitis is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is now uncommon
due to the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination and is more recently caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae non-type B, H.
parainfluenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida Very rarely, it
can cause necrotising supraglottitis/epiglottitis, and this has been reported in 
immunocompromised individuals. We present a unique case of multipathogenic
supraglottitis causing laryngeal fibrinoid necrosis in an immunocompetent
patient. During his admission, the patient was critically unwell and required
surgical intervention and tracheostomy. However, he made a full recovery with no 
persisting morbidity. We believe that this was owed to the aggressive
antimicrobial therapy, timely surgical management of the disease process and the 
patientâ€™s immunocompetency.
