OBJECTIVE: To evaluate HIV-related and other clinical risk factors associated
with oropharynx cancer (OPSCC) in HIV-infected U.S. Veterans.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study utilizing Veterans Affairs HIV Clinical Case 
Registry (CCR) data from 1985 to 2010. Outcome was incident OPSCC as indicated by
1 inpatient or 2 outpatient ICD-9 codes. Cox proportional hazard models were used
to determine hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk
factor on the time to OPSCC diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 40,996 HIV-infected male veterans were included in the cohort
with 97 cases of OPSCC. The age adjusted incidence rate was 23.2/100,000 [95% CI 
17.8-29.2]. Age>50 (aHR=3.8, 95% CI 1.9-7.8), recent CD4<200 (aHR=3.8, 95% CI
2.0-7.3), and undetectable HIV viral loads 40-79% of the time (aHR=1.8, 95% CI
1.1-3.0) were associated with an increased risk of OPSCC. Era of HIV diagnosis,
utilization of cART, nadir CD4 count, race, smoking history, and previous risk of
HPV disease, including condyloma or invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus 
(SCCA) were not associated with increased risk of OPSCC.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were older at beginning of follow up, had lower CD4
counts around the time of OPSCC diagnosis, and moderate HIV viral control during 
follow-up had an increased risk of OPSCC. Other HPV-related diseases such as SCCA
and condyloma did not increase the risk for OPSCC.
