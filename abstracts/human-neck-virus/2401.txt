PURPOSE: To examine the acute morbidity of high dose head and neck RT and CRT in 
patients with infected with HIV.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: All HIV-positive patients who underwent radiation therapy 
for head and neck cancer in our department between 2004 and 2008 were reviewed.
Treatment related data were examined. All treatments were delivered with
megavoltage photon beams or electron beams. Patients were evaluated by an
attending radiation oncologist for toxicity and response on a weekly basis during
therapy and monthly after treatment in a multidisciplinary clinic. Acute
toxicities were recorded using the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group (RTOG)
common toxicity criteria. Response to treatment was based on both physical exam
as well as post-treatment imaging as indicated.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients who underwent RT with a diagnosis of HIV were
identified. Median age was 53 years and median follow-up was 22 months. Twelve
had squamous cell carcinoma and one had lymphoproliferative parotiditis. Median
radiation dose was 66.4 Gy and median duration of treatment was 51 days. The
median number of scheduled radiotherapy days missed was zero (range 0 to 7). One 
patient (8%) developed Grade 4 confluent moist desquamation. Eight patients (61%)
developed Grade 3 toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, HIV-positive individuals appear to tolerate
treatment for head and neck cancer, with toxicity similar to that in HIV-negative
individuals.
