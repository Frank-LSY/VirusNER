Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus discovered more than
50Â years ago. EBV-associated lymphomagenesis is still a significant
viral-associated disease as it involves a diverse range of pathologies,
especially B-cell lymphomas. Recent development of high-throughput
next-generation sequencing technologies and in vivo mouse models have
significantly promoted our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms 
which drive these cancers and allowed for the development of therapeutic
intervention strategies. This review will highlight the current advances in
EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas, focusing on transcriptional regulation,
chromosome aberrations, in vivo studies of EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis, as well 
as the treatment strategies to target viral-associated lymphomas.
