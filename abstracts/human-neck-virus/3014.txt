PURPOSE: To determine the occurrence, clinical course and outcome of our patients
with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), nasal type. The nasal type of
natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), is rare in the European population but is
more frequent in Asia, Central and South America where it accounts for 15-20% of 
all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This type of lymphoma is characterized by tissue
necrosis and destruction of the nasal cavity and upper aero-digestive tract. The 
disease is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and has an 
aggressive clinical course, poor clinical outcome and high resistance to
chemotherapy.
PATIENTS: 63 patients with NHL were treated in our department between 2006 and
2011. Eleven patients were diagnosed with extranodal lymphoma, 6 in the area of
head and neck. Three of them belonged to NKTCL, nasal type group (4.7%), 1 was
diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 2 were marginal zone lymphomas.
CONCLUSION: Two out of 3 patients with nasal type NKTCL, had extremely aggressive
disease resistant to applied chemotherapy (anthracycline containing regimen),
while 1 patient remains in complete remission 6 years after diagnosis.
