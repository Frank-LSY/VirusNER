Epstein-Barr (EBV) infection and presence of a nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) case
in the family increases the risk of developing NPC. Aberrant anti-EBV
immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies (EBV-IgA) may be present in the sera of
non-cancer individuals and predict NPC. Limited studies report the presence of
EBV-IgA antibodies within non-cancer individuals in Indonesia where the disease
is prevalent. This study aimed at exploring whether EBV-IgA was found more
frequently among first degree relatives of NPC patients and individuals
presenting with chronic symptoms in the head and neck area compared to healthy
controls. A total of 967 non-cancer subjects were recruited, including 509 family
members of NPC cases, 196 individuals having chronic complaints in the head and
neck region, and 262 healthy donors of the local blood bank. Sera were analyzed
using a standardized peptide-based EBV-IgA ELISA. Overall, 61.6% of all
individuals had anti-EBV IgA reactivity equal to or below cut off value (CoV).
Seroreactivity above CoV was significantly higher in females (38.7%) compared to 
males (28.7%) (p = 0.001). Older individuals had more seroreactivity above CoV
(42.5%) than the younger ones (26.4%) (p< 0.001). Seroprevalence was
significantly higher in family members of NPC patients (41.7%), compared to 32.7%
of individuals with chronic head and neck problems (p = 0.028) and 16.4% healthy 
blood donors (p< 0.001). As conclusion, this study showed a significant higher
seroprevalence in healthy family members of NPC cases and subjects presenting
with chronic symptoms in the head and neck area compared to healthy individuals
from the general community. This finding indicates that both groups have elevated
risk of developing NPC and may serve as targets for a regional NPC screening
program.
