Laryngeal papillomatosis associated dysplasia in the adult population: an update 
on prevalence and HPV subtyping.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the prevalence of laryngeal
dysplasia and associated human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes in adult patients, 
18 years or older, suffering from laryngeal papillomatosis at a tertiary care
institution.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Patients with biopsy proven laryngeal papillomatosis were identified via
chart review. All available pathology specimens were reviewed by a dedicated head
and neck pathologist to confirm/refute the diagnosis of laryngeal dysplasia, and 
grade the level of dysplasia. Interrater agreement was compared using
cross-tabulation methods. Specimens identified to be positive for dysplasia
underwent further testing via in situ hybridization for low-risk (6/11) or
high-risk (16/18) HPV subtypes.
RESULTS: Of the 85 subjects identified to have laryngeal papillomatosis, 24(28%) 
demonstrated laryngeal dysplasia. There was good interrater agreement on the
presence of dysplasia; however, there was only fair agreement on the grade of
dysplasia. Of the pathology specimens tested for HPV subtype, the majority of
patients (62%) were positive for HPV 6/11, including all high-grade dysplasia
patients. Three (12%) dysplasia specimens were negative for both high- and
low-risk HPV subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a 28% prevalence of dysplasia in our patient population
with the majority of patients positive for low-risk HPV subtypes indicating that 
high-risk HPV subtypes do not predispose laryngeal papilloma patients to
dysplasia.
