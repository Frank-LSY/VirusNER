BACKGROUND: Patients with hypopharyngeal cancer have a 5-year survival of only
15% to 30%. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor and a favorable
prognostic factor for oropharyngeal carcinoma and p16 has been suggested as a
surrogate marker for HPV-induced cancer. However, few studies have been performed
on HPV and p16 in hypopharyngeal cancer.
METHODS: One hundred nine pretreatment hypopharyngeal cancer biopsies were
analyzed for presence of HPV and p16 overexpression, and the results were
correlated to patient survival.
RESULTS: Of 109 tumors, 7 were HPV-positive (4 HPV16) and 18 overexpressed p16.
There was some correlation between survival and HPV status, but not with regard
to p16 expression. Notably, all patients with HPV16-positive tumors, also
overexpressing p16, lived tumor free for more than 3 years.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that HPV-induced hypopharyngeal cancer is rare
and that p16 is not a suitable biomarker for presence of HPV in this tumor type.
