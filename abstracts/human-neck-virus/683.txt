Juvenile-Onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is a rare benign
neoplasm of the respiratory mucosa caused by human papilloma virus. Previous
studies on the possible associations between HLA alleles and JORRP have shown
various results in different ethnic groups. The present study aims to investigate
the association between JORRP and HLA class II DRB1and DQB1 alleles in Chinese
Han children. We found that the frequencies of HLA-DRB1*03:01 (pc = 0.0378,
OR = 4.8) and HLA-DQB1*02:01 (pc = 0.021, OR = 4.8) alleles were significantly
higher in patients with JORRP than in controls. In addition, HLA-DRB1*03:01
allele significantly correlated with aggressive JORRP (r = 0.467, p = 0.009).
This was the first study on the HLA alleles in Chinese Han patients with JORRP.
Future studies are required to further elucidate the correlation of HLA class II 
alleles and susceptibility to JORRP.
