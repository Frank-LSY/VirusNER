Parotid abscess is an uncommon condition in infants. It is frequently associated 
with prematurity, prolonged gavage feeding, and dehydration. Mumps is a viral
disease caused by paramyxovirus. It frequently involves the parotid gland and is 
only rarely found in the pancreas, testis, or brain. The authors describe a rare 
case of a 10-month-old infant with mumps who developed the classical
manifestations of unilateral acute parotitis progressing to formation of a
parotid abscess that responded to 2 rounds of surgical drainage and antibiotic
therapy.
