Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) mortality shows great disparity between endemic high 
risk areas, where non-keratinizing carcinoma (NKC) histology is prevalent, and
non-endemic low risk regions, where the keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
(KSCC) type is more frequent. We used the World Health Organization database to
calculate NPC mortality trends from 1970 to 2014 in several countries worldwide. 
For the European Union (EU), the United States (US) and Japan, we also predicted 
trends to 2020. In 2012, the highest age-standardized (world standard) rates were
in Hong Kong (4.51/100,000 men and 1.15/100,000 women), followed by selected
Eastern European countries. The lowest rates were in Northern Europe and Latin
America. EU rates were 0.27/100,000 men and 0.09/100,000 women, US rates were
0.20/100,000 men and 0.08/100,000 women and Japanese rates were 0.16/100,000 men 
and 0.04/100,000 women. NPC mortality trends were favourable for several
countries. The decline was -15% in men and -5% in women between 2002 and 2012 in 
the EU, -12% in men and -9% in women in the US and about -30% in both sexes in
Hong Kong and Japan. The favourable patterns in Europe and the United States are 
predicted to continue. Changes in salted fish and preserved food consumption
account for the fall in NKC. Smoking and alcohol prevalence disparities between
sexes and geographic areas may explain the different rates and trends observed
for KSCC and partially for NKC. Dietary patterns, as well as improvement in
management of the disease, may partly account for the observed trends, too.
