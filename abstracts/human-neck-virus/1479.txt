Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can specifically kill cancer cells and has less
toxicity to normal cells. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein is an
important structural protein in NDV pathogenesis and has been postulated as a
promising candidate for antitumor therapy. The aim of this study was to
investigate the anticancer potential of recombinant adenovirus Ad-HN-PEG3p-E1a.
An MTS assay was performed to determine viral proliferation after viral
infection, the data showed that the proliferation ability of osteosarcoma cells
decreased, whereas there was no significant change in normal hepatic cells. DAPI 
and Annexin V experiments showed that osteosarcoma cells were killed because of
apoptosis, active oxygen content, and augmented mitochondrial membrane potential 
loss. Caspase Activity Assay Kits were used to detect the caspase-3 activities of
the treated OS-732 for increased expression. Western blot analysis showed that
cytochrome C increased significantly and apoptosis of the virus was confirmed in 
tumor cells. In-vivo experiments show that NDV has an inhibitory effect on tumor 
growth. The recombinant adenovirus, which is composed of a HN protein and
progressive increment promoter PEG3p, could inhibit the growth of OS-732 and
promote the apoptosis of tumor cells. However, there was no clear relationship
with normal cell (L02) apoptosis.
