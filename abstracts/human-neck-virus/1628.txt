BACKGROUND: Knowledge about prognostic factors in surgically treated patients
with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is limited. The purpose of this 
study was to identify influential factors on survival in a large cohort of
patients with surgically treated oropharyngeal SCC.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of survival estimates in patients with surgically
treated oropharyngeal SCC using tumoral positivity for human papillomavirus (HPV)
and risk-of-death categories according to a study from 2010 as stratification
factors.
RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS)
rates after surgery alone were higher in HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC (OS 80%
vs 62%; P = .01; DSS 92% vs 76%; P = .03). Patients in the low-risk category had 
higher survival rates (OS 91%; DSS 99%) than patients in the intermediate-risk
group (OS 63%; DSS 83%), and high-risk group (OS 61%; DSS 75%).
CONCLUSION: Nonsmokers with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC have a better
prognosis than smokers with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC and also than patients
with HPV-negative tumors when treated by surgery alone.
