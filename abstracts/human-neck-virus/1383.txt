IMPORTANCE: Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal carcinoma (HPV-OPC) is
increasing in incidence in the United States. Although HPV-OPC has favorable
prognosis, 10% to 25% of HPV-OPCs recur. Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) 
DNA in oral rinses is associated with HPV-OPC, but its potential as a prognostic 
biomarker is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HPV DNA detection in oral rinses after treatment 
for HPV-OPC is associated with recurrence and survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of patients with
incident HPV-OPC diagnosed from 2009 to 2013 at 4 academic tertiary referral
cancer centers in the United States. Oral rinse samples were collected at
diagnosis and after treatment (9, 12, 18, and 24 months after diagnosis), and
evaluated for HPV DNA. Among an initial cohort of 157 participants with incident 
HPV-OPC treated with curative intent, 124 had 1 or more posttreatment oral rinses
available and were included in this study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the association of HPV DNA
detection in oral rinses with survival was evaluated using Cox regression
analysis.
RESULTS: Oral HPV type 16 (HPV16) DNA was common at diagnosis (67 of 124
participants [54%]). In contrast, oral HPV16 DNA was detected in only 6
participants after treatment (5%), including 5 with HPV16 DNA also detected at
diagnosis (persistent oral HPV16 DNA). Two-year DFS and OS were 92% (95% CI,
94%-100%) and 98% (95% CI, 93%-99%). Persistent oral HPV16 DNA was associated
with worse DFS (hazard ratio, 29.7 [95% CI, 9.0-98.2]) and OS (hazard ratio, 23.5
[95% CI, 4.7-116.9]). All 5 participants with persistent oral HPV16 DNA developed
recurrent disease, 3 with local disease involvement. In contrast, just 9 of 119
participants (8%) without persistent oral HPV16 DNA developed recurrent disease, 
only 1 (11%) with local disease involvement. Median (range) time from earliest
posttreatment oral HPV16 DNA detection to recurrence was 7.0 (3.7-10.9) months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in oral rinses is
common at diagnosis but rare after treatment for HPV-OPC. Our data suggest that, 
although infrequent, persistent HPV16 DNA in posttreatment oral rinses is
associated with poor prognosis and is a potential tool for long-term tumor
surveillance, perhaps more so for local recurrence.
