BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established oncogenic agent in
the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma. Its role in the oncogenesis of tumors
such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is not clear. Globally, approximately
3% of OSCCs are positive for HPV. Studies conducted in India indicate its
prevalence from as low as 0% to as high as 74%. However, a recent Indian study on
leukoplakia failed to find any evidence of HPV involvement. This motivated us to 
reexamine the HPV status in OSCC.
AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of HPV in OSCC.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a rural teaching hospital-based cross-sectional
study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty histopathologically confirmed samples of OSCC were
used for the study. Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen, surgically-resected
specimens. HPV positivity was tested by polymerase chain reaction-based method
using GP5+/6+ primers in the L1 consensus region of the viral genome.
RESULTS: None of the samples were HPV positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate that the association between HPV and 
OSCC may be overestimated. Hence, multicentric studies covering diverse
geographical and socioeconomic groups are needed to delineate the profile of HPV 
infectivity and OSCC in the Indian subcontinent.
