Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, late-onset
muscle disorder characterized by ptosis, swallowing difficulties, proximal limb
weakness and nuclear aggregates in skeletal muscles. OPMD is caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion in the PABPN1 gene that results in an N-terminal
expanded polyalanine tract in polyA-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Here we
show that the treatment of a mouse model of OPMD with an adeno-associated
virus-based gene therapy combining complete knockdown of endogenous PABPN1 and
its replacement by a wild-type PABPN1 substantially reduces the amount of
insoluble aggregates, decreases muscle fibrosis, reverts muscle strength to the
level of healthy muscles and normalizes the muscle transcriptome. The efficacy of
the combined treatment is further confirmed in cells derived from OPMD patients. 
These results pave the way towards a gene replacement approach for OPMD
treatment.
