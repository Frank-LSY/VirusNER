OBJECTIVE: In this study we 1) measured the impact of juvenile-onset recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis on health-related quality of life, voice-related
quality of life, and family psychosocial well-being; and 2) compared these
different measures, exploring their intercorrelation and their correlation with
clinical disease severity.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional qualitative study.
SETTING: Tertiary academic pediatric hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive children with active juvenile-onset
recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP) were included. Standardized
interviews were performed on parents and children with the use of four validated 
tools: the Health Utilities Index version 3; the Pediatric Voice-Related Quality 
of Life survey; the Impact on Family Scale; and a visual analogue health
preference measure. Clinical disease severity and demographic data also were
collected.
RESULTS: Subjects (13 male, 7 female) had a median age of 9.2 years, median age
of JoRRP onset of 3.8 years, and averaged four procedures per year of disease.
Mean health utility was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0.84) on a scale of 0 
(death) to 1 (perfect health). Marked impact on voice-related quality of life and
family psychosocial health also was identified. Health burden correlated poorly
with existing methods of severity scoring.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use validated measures of health utility, 
voice-related quality of life, and psychosocial impact. This information has
public health implications, providing essential parameters for accurate modeling 
studies and cost-utility analysis of future interventions, including different
human papilloma virus vaccination strategies.
