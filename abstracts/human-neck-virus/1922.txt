OBJECTIVES: Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Mutated (ATM) gene loss has been associated
with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC). We investigated the relationship between ATM loss detected by
fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) with patient outcome, and its
relationship with Human Papillomavirus (HPV)/p16(INK4A) status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Copy number of the ATM gene and chromosome 11 were
determined by FISH and HPV status was determined using p16(INK4A)
immunohistochemistry in 87 paraffin embedded tumour samples from patients with
HNSCC treated with chemoradiation at a single institution. ATM loss was
correlated with patient outcome as both a continuous and dichotomous variable.
RESULTS: Of 73 evaluable patients, 44 (60.3%) demonstrated loss of the ATM gene. 
There was no correlation between ATM loss (defined as a mean ratio of ATM:
chromosome 11<0.75) and overall survival (OS, p=0.67) or time to locoregional
failure (TTLRF, p=0.72). Similarly, when evaluated as a continuous variable there
was no significant relationship between ATM loss and patient outcome (OS, p=0.89;
TTLRF, p=0.21). No significant relationship was found between p16(INK4A) status
and ATM loss, for patient outcome. We found 35.6% (n=26) of patients demonstrated
polysomy of chromosome 11 (defined as the presence of a mean >2.5 copies of
chromosome 11) which was significantly associated with p16(INK4A) negative status
(p=0.0004), but did not influence outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: ATM loss is a frequent event in HNSCC, however it does not impact
outcome after treatment with chemoradiation. Polysomy of chromosome 11 was
significantly associated with p16(INK4A) negative status but also lacks
prognostic significance.
