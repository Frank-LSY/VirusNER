Environmental airborne contact dermatoses.

Lachapelle JM.

This chapter is complementary to Chapter 4 published in the same series. Airborne
contact dermatitis (ABCD) is considered a prototype in the field of environmental
dermatology. It is often underestimated in most textbooks of general dermatology,
despite its frequent occurrence in daily life. ABCD may be irritant, allergic,
phototoxic, or photoallergic. Airborne contact urticaria is another example. A
particular clinical aspect is the "head and neck dermatitis", which occurs in
atopic adult patients. Occupational ABCD represents a most difficult issue in
terms of diagnostic procedures. It is obvious that non-occupational ABCD cases
involve similar problems, usually easier to solve, and our comments refer to both
conditions. Two examples of potentially airborne skin infections (e.g., anthrax
and Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever) are also described because they are closely
related to the same problematics. A new example of airborne irritant contact
dermatitis, not reported so far, is linked with the use of continuous airway
pressure in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
