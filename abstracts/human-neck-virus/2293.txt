Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an endemic head and neck cancer found in
Southeast Asia, is etiologically associated with the infection of an oncogenic
virus, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Here, we review literature findings on the
potential/putative role of STAT3 signaling in its pathogenesis and discuss
anti-STAT3 targeting as a therapeutic and possibly prevention strategy for NPC.
Lastly, the potential involvement of STAT3 in other oncovirus-associated (e.g.
the human papillomavirus) head and neck cancers have not been investigated and we
hope that findings in EBV-associated NPC can prompt future investigations in
these cancers, which are of increasing impact in the Western countries.
