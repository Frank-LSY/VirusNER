Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive neoplasm exclusively occurring in AIDS patients. Recently, increasing cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative PBL have been reported. No standard therapy protocol is currently available since there is a great difference between PBL with and without HIV infection. Here, we present a rather rare case of HIV-negative PBL in the neck that dramatically responded to radiotherapy alone. Our case highlights the possibility of PBL in the neck and helps to expand our understanding of this separate lymphoma. The related literature review summarized the clinicopathological features and treatment status of HIV-negative PBL.
