OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancer of
unknown primary (CUP) are generally excluded from clinical trials, despite
surgical series reporting detection rates of occult oropharynx primaries of >80%.
We performed a matched-pair analysis to compare outcomes between T0N1-3M0 HPV+
CUP and T1-2N1-3M0 HPV+ oropharynx known primary (OPX).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study at a single institution.
METHODS: Patients with early T stage, node positive HPV+ OPX or CUP treated with 
curative intent between 1998 and 2016 were identified. For a subgroup of CUP
patients with an unknown HPV status, we imputed HPV status and included patients 
with a >80% probability of being HPV+. Cohorts were matched based on patient
demographics using a nearest neighbor propensity technique. After matching,
patients were grouped according to either a favorable or unfavorable risk
stratification designations per current NRG Oncology clinical trial enrollment
criteria. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated
using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Of 298 patients with T1-2N1-3 OPX, 48 were matched to 48 HPV+ CUP
patients (32 with confirmed and 16 imputed HPV status). Median follow-up for CUP 
(34.1 months) and OPX (27.8 months) patients were similar (P = .23).There were no
significant differences between the CUP and OPX groups for 3-year DFS (89% vs.
85%, P = .44), and 3-year OS (91% vs. 91%, P = .11), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T0N+M0 HPV-induced CUP have similar survival outcomes 
to matched patients with T1-2N+M0 HPV+ OPX. These patients can reasonably be
included in clinical trials investigating the role of treatment deintensification
and risk stratified similar to patients with early-stage known primary OPX
cancer.
