HPV16 presence was assessed in the group of 109 patients with HNSCCs by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). VL (assessed by qPCR) and P16 expression (evaluated by immunohistochemistry) were analysed only in the subgroup of HPV16-positive tumours. These features were correlated with 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
