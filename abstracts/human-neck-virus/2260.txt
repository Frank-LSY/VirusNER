OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a scoring system
for the management of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study between May 2004 and June 2005.
Patients with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were evaluated for causative pathogens
and were assessed clinical symptoms and pharyngo-tonsillar finding by a clinical 
scoring system.
RESULTS: A total 214 adult patients were enrolled in this study. Streptococcus
pyogenes were identified at 13.6%. Thirty-one viruses were also identified by
PCR. They were adenovirus (4.8%), influenza virus (1.0%), RS virus (6.3%), and
human metapneumovirus (2.9%). Numbers of total white blood cells and levels of
C-reactive protein showed a significant positive correlation with clinical scores
(p<0.001) and were also higher in cases with S. pyogenes. The clinical scores
rapidly improved after the antimicrobial treatments in moderate cases and severe 
cases.
CONCLUSION: The current study strongly suggested that the clinical scoring system
reflected disease severity well and would be very useful for evaluating clinical 
course and decision making for the antimicrobial treatment of acute
pharyngo-tonisllitis.
