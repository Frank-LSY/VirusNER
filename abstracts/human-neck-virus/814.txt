Human papillomavirus (HPV) is etiologically responsible for a distinct subset of 
head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). HPV-positive HNSCCs (HPV-HNSCCs)
most commonly arise from the oropharynx and are responsible for the increasing
incidence of oropharyngeal SCC (OSCC) in the United States (US) and abroad.
HPV-positive OSCC (HPV-OSCC) has a unique demographic and risk factor profile and
tumor biology. HPV-OSCC patients tend to be white, younger, and have a higher
cumulative exposure to sexual behaviors as compared with HPV-negative OSCC
patients. HPV-positive tumor status also significantly improves survival, and is 
indeed the single strongest prognostic factor for OSCC. The mechanisms that
underlie the improved prognosis conferred by HPV-positive disease are unknown.
The purpose of this review is to describe the clinical impact of HPV status in
HNSCC, particularly in OSCC, both in terms of the unique clinic-demographic
profile and prognostic implications.
