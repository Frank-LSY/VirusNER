Silk-elastinlike protein polymer (SELP) hydrogels were used for matrix-mediated delivery of oncolytic Ad, containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to C-Met (sh-C-Met), to solid tumors in a nude mouse model of human head and neck cancer. The biological activity of Ad released from SELP hydrogels was examined as a function of time to investigate protective effects on viral activity. Antitumor efficacy and viral distribution were investigated for 3 weeks in tumor-bearing mice.
