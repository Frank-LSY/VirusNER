TTV prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27/71, 38%; tumor biopsy: 22/74, 30%) than in controls (saliva: 8/56, 14%; oral mucosa: 1/19, 5%). TTV prevalence was also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral carcinoma (saliva: 9/18, 50%; biopsy: 5/21, 24%). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV belonging mostly to genotypes 1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the cases, identical TTV strains were present in the biopsy and salivary sample of the same HNCC patient. In addition, the same TTV strain was detected in 2 laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 independent patients.
