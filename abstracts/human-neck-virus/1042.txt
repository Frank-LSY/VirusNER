BACKGROUND: A microfocused ultrasound system with visualization (MFU-V) is
currently indicated for use as a noninvasive dermatological aesthetic treatment
to lift the eyebrows, lax submental and neck tissue, and improve lines and
wrinkles of the décolleté.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of any safety signals when combining MFU-V 
with botulinum toxin-A and/or semipermanent and temporary dermal fillers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed using subjects 
who received aesthetic treatments including incobotulinumtoxinA injection,
cohesive polydensified matrix hyaluronic acid (CPM HA) dermal fillers, and
calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) dermal fillers within 6 months of treatment with
MFU-V in the same or different anatomic areas.
RESULTS: All subjects (N = 101; 96 female; 25-70 year old) received MFU-V, 18%
received incobotulinumtoxinA injections, and 81% were treated with CPM HA and/or 
CaHA fillers. Seven adverse events (7%) were reported: bruising/purpura (n = 4), 
swelling (n = 1), paresthesia (n = 1), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) outbreak (n
= 1). Only the HSV outbreak was considered to be related to combined treatments.
CONCLUSION: Although limited by relatively few subjects, the results of the
present study suggest that the safety profile of MFU-V combined with other
aesthetic products is consistent with the safety profiles of the individual
treatments.
