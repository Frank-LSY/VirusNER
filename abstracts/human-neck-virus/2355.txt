OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cohort study was to examine the role of the chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
MATERIALS & METHODS: Sera from 205 NPC patients and 231 healthy individuals, and 
86 NPC tumor samples were enrolled. CXCL9 expression in tissue samples was
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. CXCL9 serum
concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: CXCL9 expression was significantly higher in tumors than in normal
epithelium. CXCL9 serum concentrations were also significantly higher in NPC
patients compared to those in healthy individuals (516.8±617.6 vs. 170.7±375.0
pg/mL, P<0.0001). Serum CXCL9 levels were significantly higher in NPC patients
with higher tumor stages, nodal stages, and overall stages (P<0.001, P = 0.001,
and P<0.001, respectively). We found a statistically significant correlation
between the concentrations of CXCL9 and EBV DNA load in the NPC patients
(Spearman's correlation analysis; r = 0.473, P<0.001; 95% confidence interval,
0.346-0.582). Moreover, NPC patients with higher CXCL9 levels (>290 pg/mL,
median) before treatment had worse prognoses for overall survival and
disease-free survival (P = 0.045 and P = 0.008, respectively). Multivariate
logistic regression analyses also indicated that higher CXCL9 serum levels were
an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CXCL9 is associated with tumor burden and
aggressiveness of NPC tumors and the serum level of this ligand may be useful as 
a prognostic indicator.
