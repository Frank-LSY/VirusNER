INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic modifications have been reported to play an important
role in regulating gene expression and these modifications become critical when
they have a role in controlling another important layer of epigenetic regulation 
namely microRNAs. In the present study, we have identified the microRNAs that may
be regulated by promoter DNA methylation and histone acetylation in Human
papilloma virus-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODOLOGY: HPV-negative cell line (UPCI:SCC-116) and HPV-16 +ve cell line
(UPCI:SCC-090) were treated with methylation inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine,
AZA) and acetylation inhibitor (Trichostatin-A, TSA), followed by micro-array
analysis. The differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in control (n = 10),
HPV-16 +ve (n = 30), and HPV -ve (n = 30) HNC, TCGA (n = 529) tissue samples, and
two HPV -ve (SCC116 and Hacat) and two HPV +ve (SCC090 and SiHa) cell lines.
Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP)
were performed to validate their regulation. In silico and in vitro analyses of
identified miRNAs were done to study putative pathways they target and their
possible role in carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: Among 10 miRNAs specifically up-regulated in microarray analysis of
AZA-treated SCC090 cells, we observed significantly decreased expression of
hsa-miR-181c-5p, hsa-miR-132-5p, hsa-miR-658 in HPV +ve HNC cohort, TCGA tissue
samples, and cell lines as compared to their HPV -ve counterpart, and their
promoter region also possesses CpG islands. MSP and analysis of TCGA data
(MethHC) revealed increased frequency of methylation at the promoter of
hsa-miR-132-5p that is negatively correlated with its expression. In TSA-treated 
SCC090 cells, out of 7 miRNAs, two namely Hsa-miR-129-2-3p and Hsa-miR-449a were 
found to be up-regulated as compared to HPV -ve cells. However, the levels of
enrichment by anti-acetyl-H3 and anti-acetyl-H4 were significantly low in cell
lines compared to respective controls and both were up-regulated in HPV +ve
compared to HPV -ve TCGA tissue samples. In silico analysis revealed
hsa-miR-132-5p targeted canonical β-catenin/wnt pathway and modulation of
down-stream genes of the pathway was observed on over-expression/inhibition of
hsa-miR-132-5p.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests the role of epigenetic modifications in
regulating expression of miRNAs in HPV +ve HNSCC.
