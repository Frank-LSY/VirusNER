BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have a better survival than with HPV-negative
oropharyngeal SCC. An (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT
((18) F-FDG-PET-CT) may also provide prognostic information. We evaluated
glycolytic characteristics in HPV-negative and HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC.
METHODS: Forty-four patients underwent pretreatment (18) F-FDG-PET-CT.
Standardized uptake values (SUVs) and metabolic active tumor volumes (MATVs) were
determined for primary tumors. HPV status was determined with p16 immunostaining,
followed by high-risk HPV DNA detection on the positive cases.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were HPV-positive (61.4%). Median MATV was 2.8 mL 
(range = 1.6-5.1 mL) for HPV-positive and 6.0 mL (range = 4.4-18.7 mL) for
HPV-negative tumors (p < .001). SUV values are volume dependent (partial volume
effect), therefore, MATV was included as covariate in multivariate analysis. In
this multivariate analysis, the maximum SUV in HPV-positive tumors was 3.9 units 
lower than in HPV-negative tumors (p = .01).
CONCLUSION: The (18) F-FDG-PET-CT parameters are lower in HPV-positive than in
HPV-negative patients. Low pretreatment SUV values in HPV-positive oropharyngeal 
SCC may be at least partly explained by HPV-induced tumor changes.
