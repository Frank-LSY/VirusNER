Hypoxia is a prevalent feature of many tumors contributing to disease progression
and treatment resistance, and therefore constitutes an attractive therapeutic
target. Several hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAP) have been developed, including
the phase III candidate TH-302 (evofosfamide) and the preclinical agent SN30000, 
which is an optimized analogue of the well-studied HAP tirapazamine. Experience
with this therapeutic class highlights an urgent need to identify biomarkers of
HAP sensitivity, including enzymes responsible for prodrug activation during
hypoxia. Using genome-scale shRNA screens and a high-representation library
enriched for oxidoreductases, we identified the flavoprotein P450 (cytochrome)
oxidoreductase (POR) as the predominant determinant of sensitivity to SN30000 in 
three different genetic backgrounds. No other genes consistently modified SN30000
sensitivity, even within a POR-negative background. Knockdown or genetic knockout
of POR reduced SN30000 reductive metabolism and clonogenic cell death and
similarly reduced sensitivity to TH-302 under hypoxia. A retrospective evaluation
of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas showed heterogeneous POR expression and
suggested a possible relationship between human papillomavirus status and HAP
sensitivity. Taken together, our study identifies POR as a potential predictive
biomarker of HAP sensitivity that should be explored during the clinical
development of SN30000, TH-302, and other hypoxia-directed agents.
