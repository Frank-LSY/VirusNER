BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the
context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of cancer of unknown
primary (CUP) origin is unclear.
METHODS: Patients treated for CUP at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 
2001 and 2013 were stratified by p16 status and retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 73 patients included, those with p16-positive tumors (63%) had
less advanced nodal status (N1-N2b; 52% vs 89%; p = .035) and less aggressive
treatment. Patients with p16-positive tumors had improved 3-year disease-free
survival (DFS; 79% vs 56%; p = .012) independent of nodal status and treatment in
multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
0.08-0.95).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with CUP, p16-positive status is an independent
predictor of DFS but not overall survival (OS). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
