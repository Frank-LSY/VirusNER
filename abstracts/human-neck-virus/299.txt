BACKGROUND: A growing proportion of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). In light of the unique natural
history and prognosis of HPV-related HNSCCs, routine HPV testing is being
incorporated into diagnostic protocols. Accordingly, there is an escalating
demand for an optimal detection strategy that is sensitive and specific,
transferrable to the diagnostic laboratory, standardized across laboratories,
cost-effective, and amenable to broad application across specimen types including
cytologic preparations.
METHODS: Cytologic preparations (fine-needle aspirates [FNAs] and brushes) were
obtained from surgically resected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of
high-risk HPV using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. HPV analysis was also performed
on the corresponding tissue sections using HPV in situ hybridization and p16
immunohistochemistry. In cases in which the immunohistochemical and in situ
hybridization results were discordant, HPV status was determined by real-time
polymerase chain reaction detection of E7 expression. HPV status in the tissues
and corresponding cytologic samples was compared.
RESULTS: Based on benchmark HPV testing of the tissue sections, 14 HNSCCs were
classified as HPV positive and 10 as HPV negative. All corresponding cytologic
preparations were correctly classified using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The Hybrid Capture 2 strategy, already widely used for the detection
of high-risk HPV in cervical brushes, is readily transferrable to HNSCCs.
Consistent accuracy in cytologic preparation suggests its potential application
in FNAs from patients who present with lymph node metastases, and may eliminate
the need to obtain tissue solely for the purpose of HPV testing.
