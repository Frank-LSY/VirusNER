OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The effect of smoking and human papillomavirus (HPV) on
overall survival (OS) of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients
undergoing concurrent chemotherapy (CCRT) remains unclear.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Clinical characteristics of OPSCC patients treated between 2008 and 2015
with CCRT were abstracted from medical records. OS curves and multivariate cox
proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were examined.
RESULTS: Of 120 evaluable patients, 71% had HPV+ tumors. Median follow-up
duration for the entire cohort was 41.5 months (range = 6-88 months). HPV+
current smokers experienced significantly worse 5-year OS (73% alive vs. 36%
alive, P = .01) and there was a similar trend in HPV- current smokers (66% alive 
vs. 31% alive, P = .28) compared to former/never smokers undergoing CCRT. In a
multivariate cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, gender, and overall 
tumor stage, HPV+ current smokers experienced nearly a fourfold increase in
overall mortality in comparison to HPV+ never/former smokers (HR = 3.68, 95% CI =
1.35-10.0). Similarly, current smokers with HPV- tumors (HR = 6.80, 95% CI =
1.11-41.67) had increased mortality compared to never/former smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with poor prognosis, independent of
HPV status, in CCRT-treated OPSCC patients. Current smoking produced an
approximately four- to sevenfold increase in risk of mortality for HPV+ and HPV- 
patients, respectively. Regardless of pack years and HPV status, efforts should
be made to achieve smoking cessation before CCRT.
