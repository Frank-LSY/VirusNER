Until recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines only sporadically led to long-term
clinical responses. We here report on a novel vaccine modality, characterized by 
the administration of long (23-45 amino acids) synthetic peptides in incomplete
Freund adjuvant (mineral oil-based, Montanide ISA-51), delivered subcutaneously. 
Such vaccines were first demonstrated to be much more potent in preclinical
T-cell response induction and tumor therapy experiments than short major
histocompatibility complex class I-binding peptides that have been used
extensively in the clinic. A long-peptide vaccine consisting of 13 overlapping
peptides, together covering the entire length of the 2 oncogenic proteins E6 and 
E7 of high-risk human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16), caused complete regression
of all lesions and eradication of virus in 9 of 20 women with high-grade vulvar
intraepithelial neoplasia. The nature and strength of the vaccine-induced T-cell 
response were significantly correlated with the clinical response. This vaccine
promises to be of use, not only in patients with premalignant lesions caused by
high-risk HPV16, but also in patients with malignant tumors caused by this virus,
including HPV16-positive cervical cancer, anal cancer, and head and neck cancer.
