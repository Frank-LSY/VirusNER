OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate differences in dynamic 
contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) parameters on the basis of the status of human
papillomavirus (HPV) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) biomarkers in
patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity and oropharynx by 
use of histogram analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 consecutive patients with oral cavity and
oropharyngeal SCC underwent DCE-MRI before receiving treatment. DCE parameter
maps of the volume transfer constant (K(trans)), the flux rate constant (kep),
and the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) were obtained. The
histogram parameters were calculated using the entire enhancing tumor volume and 
were compared between the patient subgroups on the basis of HPV and EGFR
biomarker statuses.
RESULTS: The cumulative histogram parameters of K(trans) and kep showed lower
values in the HPV-negative and EFGR-overexpression group than in the HPV-positive
EGFR-negative group. These differences were statistically significant for the
mean (p = 0.009), 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values of K(trans) and for the 
25th percentile value of kep when correlated with HPV status in addition to the
mean K(trans) value (p = 0.047) and kep value (p = 0.004) when correlated with
EGFR status. No statistically significant difference in ve was found on the basis
of HPV and EGFR status.
CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI is useful for the assessment of the tumor microenvironment
associated with HPV and EGFR biomarkers before treatment of patients with oral
cavity and oropharyngeal SCC.
