Infection with high-risk types of the human papilloma virus (HPV) is an
etiological risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and
associated with a better response to therapy and improved survival. A better
understanding of the molecular principles underlying the differences in clinical 
behavior could pave the way to establish more effective and less toxic therapy
for HPV-positive OPSCC and their HPV-negative counterparts. Compelling
experimental evidence demonstrates that extensive global reprogramming of
epigenetic profiles is as important as genetic mutations during neoplastic
transformation and malignant progression, including HPV-positive OPSCC. In this
chapter, the current knowledge on HPV-related alterations in DNA methylation,
histone modification, and chromosome remodeling will be summarized and assessment
of cancer-related profiles will be discussed as a valuable tool to gain important
diagnostic or prognostic information for therapeutic decision-making and clinical
management of HNSCC patients.
