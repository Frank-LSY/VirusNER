To assess the association between sequence variants of human papillomavirus (HPV) 11 and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and the taxonomy and evolutionary history of HPV 11. Complete HPV 11 nucleotide sequences were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2000 Analyzers and compared with the HPV 11 prototype isolate (GenBank accession number: M14119) using Blast 2.0 server software. Eighteen full-length HPV 11 genomic sequences were amplified and sequenced. A total of 49 nucleotide mutations were identified, 12 of which resulted in amino acid changes. HPV 11 variants were highly conserved; the maximum pairwise difference was approximately 0.49%. The maximum pairwise difference of the 18 variants in our research was 0.39%. HPV 11 is less polymorphic than the majority of studied HPV genotypes.
