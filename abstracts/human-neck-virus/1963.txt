OBJECTIVE: The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a major determinant in prognostic risk
modelling. Recently, a prognostic model was proposed in which HPV status,
comorbidity and nodal stage were the most important prognostic factors to
determine high-, intermediate- and low-risk survival groups. Here, we report on
the validation of this model using an independent single-institutional cohort.
METHODS: A total number of 235 patients curatively treated for OPSCC in the
period 2000-2011 at the MUMC (Maastricht University Medical Center, The
Netherlands) were included. The presence of an oncogenic HPV infection was
determined by p16 immunostaining, followed by a high-risk HPV DNA PCR on the
p16-positive cases. The model variables included were HPV status, comorbidity and
nodal stage. As a measure of model performance, the Harrell's Concordance index
(Harrell's C-index) was used.
RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) estimates were 84.6%, 54.5% and 28.7%
in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. The difference
between the survival curves was highly significant (P<0.001). The Harrell's
C-index was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.75).
CONCLUSION: In this study a previously developed prognostic risk model was
validated. This model will help to personalise treatment in OPSCC patients. This 
model is publicly available at www.predictcancer.org.
