Nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma--classified as extranodal NK/T-cell
lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, by the World Health Organization--is a non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma that is almost always associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Up to 75% of
ENKTL cases occur in the upper aerodigestive tract, primarily the nasal cavity.
It is the most common type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in many Asian countries.
Histologic diagnosis is essential, and staging consists of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsy and imaging of the neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. There is a marked
dichotomy in treatment and survival between localized and disseminated disease.
Since disease incidence is rare even in prevalent areas, experience is limited
and most treatment protocols are consensus-guided. ENKTL is both chemosensitive
and radiosensitive. Early-stage, localized nasal disease is highly curable with
combination therapy, but the optimal dose, combination, and sequence of
radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still undefined. For patients with disseminated
and extranasal disease, either at initial presentation or at relapse, the
prognosis is poor. For disseminated and refractory cases, the 5-year survival
rate is below 10%, and better methods of treatment are needed.
