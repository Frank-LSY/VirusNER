Oral carcinoma is a serious public health problem and the leading cause of head
and neck cancer mortality worldwide. Moreover, oral cancer patients often present
symptoms at a late stage and show a high recurrence rate after treatment.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers for early
diagnosis or clinical oral cancer therapy. In this study, we employed a subset of
lentiviral short hairpin RNAs targeted against various kinases and phosphatases, 
designed by The RNAi Consortium, to screen systemically and in a high-throughput 
manner for potential growth regulators of oral cancer cells. The screen revealed 
a total of 50 candidate genes, for which more than 90% of growth inhibition in
human oral squamous cancer HSC-3 cells was obtained. Furthermore, bioinformatic
analysis of these candidate genes identified transforming growth factor-β
receptor type II- and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-related molecular pathways
that are involved in NF-κB-mediated growth of HSC-3 cells. These candidate genes 
may be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of oral cancer. In addition,
these candidate genes represent potential targets for anticancer drug design
helping to develop a personalized treatment to combat oral cancer.
