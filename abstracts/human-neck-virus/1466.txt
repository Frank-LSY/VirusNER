BACKGROUND: Although tobacco- and alcohol-associated head and neck cancers are
declining in the developed world, potentially human papillomavirus
(HPV)-associated oropharnygeal cancers are increasing.
METHODS: We analysed oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer rates in Australia in
1982-2005. Cancers from the oropharynx (base of tongue, tonsil and other specific
oropharyngeal sites) were classified as potentially HPV associated (n=8844);
cancers in other oral cavity and oropharyngeal sites not previously associated
with HPV were classified as comparison (n=28,379).
RESULTS: In 2000-2005, an average of 219, 159 and 110 cancers of the tonsil, base
of tongue and other oropharyngeal sites were diagnosed annually, with incidences 
of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.15), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.84) and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.50,
0.59) per 100,000, respectively. An average of 1242 comparison cancers were
diagnosed annually (6.17 (95% CI: 6.03, 6.31) per 100,000). In 1982-2005, there
were significant annual increases in tonsil (1.39% (95% CI: 0.88, 1.92%)) and
base of tongue cancers in males (3.02% (95% CI: 2.27, 3.78%)) and base of tongue 
cancer in females (3.45% (95% CI: 2.21, 4.70%)). There was a significant decrease
in comparison cancers in men (-1.69% (95% CI: -1.96, -1.42%)), but not in
females.
CONCLUSION: Potentially HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer in Australia is
increasing; the impact of HPV vaccination on these cancers should be monitored.
