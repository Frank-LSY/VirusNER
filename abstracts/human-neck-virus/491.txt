Hochuekkito (HKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo), has been used to treat symptoms of several diseases. In a recent clinical study, HKT was shown to be protective against the influenza virus infection. However, the underlying mechanism of the prophylactic effect is not clear. Mitochondrial and glycolytic pathways play important roles in cellular energy metabolism to maintain biological functions. These metabolic pathways are affected by the influenza virus infection. In this study, we examined the relationship between the preventive effects of HKT against the influenza virus infection and cellular energy metabolism in mitochondria and glycolysis using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus (IAV).
