HPV-positive head and neck carcinoma is significantly different than tobacco- and
alcohol-induced cancer. Between 30% and 50% of oropharyngeal cancers are
associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Studies still show an increasing
incidence. HPV-positive head and neck cancer patients have a better prognosis due
to a better response to therapy. Especially patients with gene overexpression of 
immunological proteins in the antigen presentation are suggested to benefit from 
radiotherapy. A current retrospective study shows better outcomes for patients
treated with radiotherapy in combination with biological targets compared to
radiochemotherapy.
