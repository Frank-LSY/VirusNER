Head and neck cancer, including oral cancer, is the sixth most common cancer in
humans worldwide. More than 90% of oral cancers are of squamous cell carcinoma
type. Recent studies have shown a strong relationship between human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection and head and neck cancer, especially oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Moreover, the incidence of HPV-related OSCC appears to be on the rise while
HPV-unrelated OSCC tends to have stabilized in the past decades. p16, a tumor
suppressor gene, normally functions as a regulator of the cell cycle. Upon
infection with high-risk types of HPV (HR-HPV), particularly types 16, 18, 31,
33, 34, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 70, the expression of p16 is
aberrantly overexpressed. Therefore, the expression of p16 is widely used as a
surrogate marker for HPV infection in head and neck cancer.
