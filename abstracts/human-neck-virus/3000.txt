Head and neck cancer arises from a series of molecular alterations progressive
from dysplasia to carcinoma in situ, and finally invasive carcinoma. Risk factors
associated with head and neck cancer include tobacco, alcohol and viral
infection. There are genetic alterations in pre-cancerous cells that contribute
to transformation. The accumulation of these alterations facilitates tumor
development. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment enables tumor progression. 
The cooperative effect of molecular alterations in the tumor cells and
compensatory microenvironment changes enable tumors to invade and metastasize.
This review focuses on the genes and molecules altered during the progression of 
head and neck cancer with an emphasis on the genetic, molecular and phenotypic
changes during the pathogenesis of head and neck cancer. Therapeutic strategies
that target key changes in the tumor cells and/or stromal cells in the tumor
microenvironment are discussed.
