Current standard treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is either
radiotherapy alone or combined chemoradiotherapy. Surgery in the form of
nasopharyngectomy is usually only offered when there is evidence of local
recurrence or persistent disease. Recurrent NPC (rNPC) can be detected earlier
with the utilization of Epstein-Barr virus molecular diagnosis. This may result
in early management with salvage surgery and hence improved survival. The facial 
translocation approach enhanced our ability to access the nasopharynx. Through a 
multidisciplinary approach with the collaboration of neurosurgeons, the surgical 
indication of salvage surgery is extended. This allowed improved respectability
in locally advanced disease and involved the skull base and intracranial
extension with reasonable morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy
is a choice for recurrent NPC with central roof or floor lesions with minimal
lateral extension. Multivariate analysis indicated that gender, parapharyngeal
space involvement, surgical margin, and the modality of adjuvant therapy impact
significantly on local control. The impact on survival is indicated by the dura
or brain involvement, local recurrence and modality of adjuvant therapy. It is
apparent that recurrent NPC patients who underwent surgery had a significantly
better survival rate than the re-radiation therapy group.
