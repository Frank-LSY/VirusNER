Over the last 10 years, it has become clear that patients with head and neck
cancer can be stratified into two distinct subgroups on the basis of the etiology
of their disease. Patients with human papillomavirus-related cancers have
significantly better survival rates and may necessitate different therapeutic
approaches than those with tobacco and/or alcohol related cancers. This review
discusses the various biomarkers currently in use for identification of patients 
with HPV-positive cancers with a focus on the advantages and limitations of
molecular and nano-scale markers.
