The human papillomavirus (HPV) comprises a heterogeneous group of double-strand
DNA viruses with variable potential to infect human epithelial cells and trigger 
neoplastic transformation. Its 8Â kb genome encodes proteins required for virus
replication and self-organized formation of infectious particles but also for
early proteins E6 and E7 able to trigger neoplastic transformation. E6 and E7 of 
high-risk (HR) HPV subtypes can bind to p53 or release E2F and abrogate
replication control. Due to variable amino acid sequence (AAS) in the binding
sites of E6 and E7 particular HR-HPV variants within subtypes are essentially
heterogeneous in efficacy triggering neoplastic transformation and cancer
development. This could explain differences in the clinical course of HPV-driven 
head and neck cancer.
