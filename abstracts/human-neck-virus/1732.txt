PURPOSE: To report atypical clinical behavior observed in human papillomavirus
(HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with radiotherapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for all newly
diagnosed OPC cases treated with radiotherapy on July 1, 2003 to April 30, 2009. 
HPV positivity was determined by p16 immunostaining in tumors. The incidence of
additional malignancies and the pattern of distant metastases (DMs) were compared
between the HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) cohorts.
RESULTS: HPV status was evaluated in 318 of 613 consecutive OPC cases (52%),
showing 236 HPV+ and 82 HPV- patients. Compared with HPV-, HPV+ cases were less
likely to have additional malignancies (prior: 11% vs. 20%, p = 0.038;
synchronous: 1% vs. 9%, p = 0.001; metachronous: 6% vs. 16%, p = 0.003). Whereas 
the majority (10 of 12) of HPV- additional head-and-neck (HN) mucosal
malignancies were in the oral cavity, there was none (0 of 7) in the HPV+ cohort 
(p < 0.001). HPV+ synchronous HN second primaries (SPs) were in the supraglottis,
post-cricoid, and nasopharynx; metachronous HN SPs were in the glottis,
supraglottis, and ethmoid plus glottis/post-cricoid region. All SPs that could be
tested were HPV+. There was no difference in DM rate (10% vs. 15%, p = 0.272),
but HPV+ DMs were more likely to involve multiple organs (46% vs. 0%, p = 0.005) 
and unusual sites.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports atypical clinical behavior seen in HPV+ OPC,
including multicentric lesions in HN mucosa and DM to multiple organs and unusual
sites. The frequency of these events is low, but they may have clinical
implications. The routine assessment of HPV status for all OPC is warranted.
