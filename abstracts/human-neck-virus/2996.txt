OBJECTIVE: To analyze potential etiology and outcomes of delayed facial palsy
(DFP) after tympanomastoid surgery.
METHODS: Fifteen cases of DFP out of 1582 cases after tympanomastoid surgery were
reviewed, and the potential causes and outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: 9 out of 15 patients (60%) had fallopian canal dehiscence and facial
nerve exposure in contrast to 323 of 1567 patients (20.6%) without DFP, with
significant difference (P<0.01). Chorda tympani was cut or overstretched in 4
cases. There were two cases with herpes labialis and IgM antibody against
varicella-zoster virus. All patients fully recovered within two months.
CONCLUSION: Fallopian canal dehiscence and facial nerve exposure was a risk
factor of DFP after tympanomastoid surgery, and chorda tympani injury and viral
reactivation may be triggering factors of DFP. The outcomes DFP after
tympanomastoid surgery were excellent.
