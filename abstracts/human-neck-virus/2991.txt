The proto-oncogene proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus
(PIM) kinases (PIM-1, PIM-2, and PIM-3) are serine/threonine kinases that are
involved in a number of signaling pathways important to cancer cells. PIM kinases
act in downstream effector functions as inhibitors of apoptosis and as positive
regulators of G1-S phase progression through the cell cycle. PIM kinases are
upregulated in multiple cancer indications, including lymphoma, leukemia,
multiple myeloma, and prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers.
Overexpression of one or more PIM family members in patient tumors frequently
correlates with poor prognosis. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate PIM
expression in low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma and to assess the role PIM
function in disease progression and their potential to serve as molecular targets
for therapy. One hundred thirty-seven cases of urothelial carcinoma were included
in this study of surgical biopsy and resection specimens. High levels of
expression of all three PIM family members were observed in both noninvasive and 
invasive urothelial carcinomas. The second-generation PIM inhibitor, TP-3654,
displays submicromolar activity in pharmacodynamic biomarker modulation, cell
proliferation studies, and colony formation assays using the UM-UC-3 bladder
cancer cell line. TP-3654 displays favorable human ether-à-go-go-related gene and
cytochrome P450 inhibition profiles compared with the first-generation PIM
inhibitor, SGI-1776, and exhibits oral bioavailability. In vivo xenograft studies
using a bladder cancer cell line show that PIM kinase inhibition can reduce tumor
growth, suggesting that PIM kinase inhibitors may be active in human urothelial
carcinomas.
