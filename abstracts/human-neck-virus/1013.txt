Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the etiology of anogenital and head
and neck cancers. The HPV DNA prevalence greatly differs by anatomical site.
Indeed, the high rates of viral DNA prevalence in anal and cervical carcinomas
contrast with the lower fraction of cancer cases attributable to HPVs in other
anatomical sites, chiefly the vulva, the penis and head and neck. Here we
analyzed 2635 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded surgical samples that had
previously tested negative for the presence of HPVs DNA using the SPF10/DEIA
procedure, in order to identify the presence of other PVs not explicitly targeted
by standard molecular epidemiologic approaches. All samples were reanalyzed using
five broad-PV PCR primer sets (CP1/2, FAP6064/FAP64, SKF/SKR, MY9/MY11, MFI/MFII)
targeting the main PV main clades. In head and neck carcinoma samples (n=1141),
we recovered DNA from two BetaHPVs, namely HPV20 and HPV21, and from three
cutaneous AlphaPVs, namely HPV2, HPV57 and HPV61. In vulvar squamous cell
carcinoma samples (n=902), we found one of the samples containing DNA of one
cutaneous HPV, namely HPV2, and 29 samples contained DNA from essentially mucosal
HPVs. In penile squamous cell carcinoma samples (n=592), we retrieved the DNA of 
HPV16 in 16 samples. Our results show first that the SPF10/DEIA is very
sensitive, as we recovered only 2.1% (55/2635) false negative results; second,
that although the DNA of cutaneous HPVs can be detected in cancer samples, their 
relative contribution remains anyway minor (0.23%; 6/2635) and may be neglected
for screening and vaccination purposes; and third, their contribution to
malignancy is not necessarily warranted and needs to be elucidated.
