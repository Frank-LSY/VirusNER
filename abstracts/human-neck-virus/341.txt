The chicken anaemia virus-derived protein Apoptin/VP3 (CAV-Apoptin) has the
important ability to induce tumour-selective apoptosis in a variety of human
cancer cells. Recently the first human Gyrovirus (HGyV) was isolated from a human
skin swab. It shows significant structural and organisational resemblance to CAV 
and encodes a homologue of CAV-Apoptin/VP3. Using overlapping primers we
constructed a synthetic human Gyrovirus Apoptin (HGyV-Apoptin) fused to green
fluorescent protein in order to compare its apoptotic function in various human
cancer cell lines to CAV-Apoptin. HGyV-Apoptin displayed a similar subcellular
expression pattern as observed for CAV-Apoptin, marked by translocation to the
nucleus of cancer cells, although it is predominantly located in the cytosol of
normal human cells. Furthermore, expression of either HGyV-Apoptin or CAV-Apoptin
in several cancer cell lines triggered apoptosis at comparable levels. These
findings indicate a potential anti-cancer role for HGyV-Apoptin.
