A total of 122 pediatric OLT recipients were reviewed. Twelve patients (10%) underwent PET imaging. Overall, four patients (33%) had evidence of PET positivity at Waldeyer's ring or cervical lymphatics. Five patients (42%) had positive EBV serology. There was a significant association between PET imaging results and EBV DNA serology results (P = .01).
