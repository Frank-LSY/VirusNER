BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify prognostic
factors in a cohort of patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
METHODS: Medical records of 142 patients treated with (chemo)radiotherapy between
September 2005 and September 2011 were reviewed and the human papillomavirus
(HPV) status was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Potential prognostic factors for 3-year locoregional control and overall survival
(OS) were evaluated.
RESULTS: HPV-positive patients (n = 82) had locoregional control and OS of 78%
and 79%, respectively. Significant prognostic factors on multivariate analysis
were smoking (p = .03) for locoregional control and OS, and comorbidity (p = .04)
for OS. Further stratification was done according to smoking behavior in
HPV-positive patients. Locoregional control in current smokers was 67% compared
to 86% in never smokers and former smokers, respectively (p = .02).
CONCLUSION: Smoking was the only modifiable prognostic factor in HPV-positive
patients. Therefore, active stop-smoking programs must be integrated in the
routine management of patients to maximize treatment results. © 2016 Wiley
