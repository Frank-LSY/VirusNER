OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of
incorporating cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing to determine the etiology of
pediatric hearing loss.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of children presenting with sensorineural
hearing loss (SNHL) at one institution from 2008 to 2013.
METHODS: Children aged 3 years or younger who presented to the senior author
(A.P.) between May 2008 and September 2013 with confirmed SNHL were evaluated.
These children underwent a sequential diagnostic paradigm that incorporated CMV
testing if no obvious etiology could be determined from the history or physical
examination.
RESULTS: One hundred eleven children with SNHL were evaluated between 2008 and
2013. Eighty-three children underwent CMV testing, imaging, and a genetic
evaluation. Those with confirmed or probable CMV-induced SNHL made up 30% of all 
children tested (n = 25), the largest group identified. CMV screening had the
lowest cost compared to genetic testing or imaging for all types of hearing loss,
except for those with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder.
CONCLUSION: We present the first sequential diagnostic paradigm utilizing CMV
testing for children presenting with SNHL. The relatively high incidence of
CMV-induced SNHL, the low cost for this assay, and the indirect benefits from
early diagnosis support the role of early CMV testing for these patients.
