BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with locally advanced SCCHN have a poor
prognosis. This study investigated the prognostic value of the tumor cell
expression of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in patients treated with
surgery followed by radiotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The impact of FGF-2-expression and 11 additional potential 
prognostic factors on loco-regional control (LRC), metastases-free survival
(MFS), and overall survival (OS) was retrospectively evaluated in 146 patients.
Additional factors included age, gender, performance status, pre-radiotherapy
hemoglobin levels, tumor site, histologic grade, T-category, N-category, human
papilloma virus (HPV) status, extent of resection, and chemotherapy. Univariate
analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test,
multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, improved LRC was significantly associated with
FGF-2-negativity [risk ratio (RR): 7.33; 95%-confidence interval (CI):
2.88-19.05; p<0.001], lower T-category (RR: 2.42; 95%-CI: 1.47-4.33; p<0.001),
lower N-category (RR: 12.36; 95%-CI: 3.48-78.91; p<0.001), and pre-radiotherapy
hemoglobin levels ≥ 12 g/dl (RR: 4.18; 95%-CI: 1.73-10.53; p=0.002). No factor
was significantly associated with improved MFS. Lower T-category showed a trend
(RR: 1.59; 95%-CI: 0.97-2.82; p=0.069). Better OS was significantly associated
with FGF-2-negativity (RR: 5.10; 2.22-11.80; p<0.001), lower T-category (RR:
2.17; 95%-CI: 1.38-3.68; p < 0.001), lower N-category (RR: 3.86; 95%-CI:
1.60-10.85; p=0.002), and pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin levels ≥ 12 g/dl (RR: 3.20;
95%-CI: 1.46-7.30; p=0.004). HPV-positivity showed a trend (RR: 2.36; 95%-CI:
n.a.; p=0.054).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell expression of FGF-2 proved to be an independent
prognostic factor for LRC and OS. This factor can help personalize treatment and 
stratify patients in future trials.
