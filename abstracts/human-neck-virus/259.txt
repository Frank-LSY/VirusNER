OBJECTIVES: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) laryngitis is rare in adults. We add a
case report to the literature and perform a literature review to further
delineate the clinical presentation, course, and treatment of HSV laryngitis in
adults.
METHODS: Case report and literature review using PubMed and Ovid databases.
RESULTS: Ten cases of diagnosed HSV laryngitis in adults were reported in the
literature. It is more common in immunocompromised patients. The mean patient age
was 51 years with a male to female ratio of 1:1. The clinical presentation and
course of HSV laryngitis is variable. Patients may have mild chronic symptoms,
such as dysphonia, or a fulminant course with rapid airway compromise. On
laryngoscopic exam, the most common findings are a white exudate or ulceration.
The most common treatment is with antiviral medication, such as acyclovir, which 
tends to be highly effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Herpes simplex virus laryngitis is rare. Clinical presentation of
HSV laryngitis is variable, and its course may be indolent or fulminant.
Treatment with antiviral medication tends to be highly effective.
