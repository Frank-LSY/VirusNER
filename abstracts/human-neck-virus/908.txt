PURPOSE: HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas clearly represent a
growing entity in the head and neck with distinct carcinogenesis,
clinico-pathological presentation and survival profile. We aimed to compare the
HPV prevalence rates and clinico-pathological correlations obtained with three
distinct commonly used HPV detection methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: p16-immunohistochemistry (IHC), HPV DNA viral load by
real-time PCR (qPCR), and HPV genotyping by a reverse hybridization-based line
probe assay (INNO-LiPA) were performed on pretreatment formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 46 patients treated for single primary
oropharyngeal carcinomas.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (61%) had a p16 overexpression in IHC. Twenty-nine
patients (63%) harbored HPV DNA on qPCR. Thirty-four patients (74%) harbored HPV 
DNA on INNO-LiPA. The concordance analysis revealed a good agreement between both
HPV DNA detection methods (κ=0.65); when both tests were positive, the depicted
HPV subtypes were always concordant (HPV16 in 27 cases, HPV18 in 1 case).
Agreement was moderate between IHC and qPCR (κ=0.59) and fair between IHC and
INNO-LiPA (κ=0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: Certain highly sensitive methods are able to detect the mere
presence of HPV without any carcinogenetic involvement while other more specific 
tests provide proof of viral transcriptional activity and thus evidence of
clinically relevant infections. The use of a stepwise approach allows reducing
false positives; p16-immunostaining seems to be an excellent screening test and
in situ hybridization may overcome some of the PCR limitations.
