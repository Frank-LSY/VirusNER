We conducted a genome-wide association study of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer
in 6,034 cases and 6,585 controls from Europe, North America and South America.
We detected eight significantly associated loci (P < 5 × 10-8), seven of which
are new for these cancer sites. Oral and pharyngeal cancers combined were
associated with loci at 6p21.32 (rs3828805, HLA-DQB1), 10q26.13 (rs201982221,
LHPP) and 11p15.4 (rs1453414, OR52N2-TRIM5). Oral cancer was associated with two 
new regions, 2p23.3 (rs6547741, GPN1) and 9q34.12 (rs928674, LAMC3), and with
known cancer-related loci-9p21.3 (rs8181047, CDKN2B-AS1) and 5p15.33 (rs10462706,
CLPTM1L). Oropharyngeal cancer associations were limited to the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) region, and classical HLA allele imputation showed a protective
association with the class II haplotype HLA-DRB1*1301-HLA-DQA1*0103-HLA-DQB1*0603
(odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, P = 2.7 × 10-9). Stratified analyses on a subgroup of
oropharyngeal cases with information available on human papillomavirus (HPV)
status indicated that this association was considerably stronger in HPV-positive 
(OR = 0.23, P = 1.6 × 10-6) than in HPV-negative (OR = 0.75, P = 0.16) cancers.
