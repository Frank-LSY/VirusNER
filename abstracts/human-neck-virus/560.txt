Over the last 20 years, there has been increasing awareness of a subset of
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), i.e. HPV-positive HNSCC.
These cancers seem to differ somewhat from HPV-negative HNSCC. Patients with
HPV-positive HNSCC tend to be younger and have a lower intake of tobacco and
alcohol. Distinct molecular profiles separate them from HPV-negative cancers and 
show similarities with HPV-positive cervical SCC. There is evidence that
HPV-positive HNSCC is a sexually transmitted disease. Patients with HPV-positive 
HNSCC are often diagnosed at a late stage with large cystic lymph nodes in the
neck. HPV-positive HNSCC show an affinity for the oropharynx, especially the
tonsils and the base of the tongue, and tend to show low differentiation
histopathologically. There is a better prognosis regardless of the treatment
regimen for HPV-positive HNSCC compared with HPV-negative HNSCC, and this seems
to be related to the immune system. Whether the new vaccines for HPV will protect
not only against cervical cancer but also against HPV-positive HNSCC remains
unknown.
