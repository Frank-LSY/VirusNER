Lymphoepithelial-like carcinomas (LELC) of the head and neck represent malignant 
neoplasms that are histologically similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
nonkeratinizing undifferentiated type but arise in locations other than the
nasopharynx. The most common location for LELC in the head and neck is the
salivary glands, in particular the parotid gland. However, LELC may arise in
other sites including the oropharynx (tonsils, base of tongue), sinonasal tract, 
larynx, and middle ear/temporal bone. Unlike the nonkeratinizing undifferentiated
type of NPC which is etiologically linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), LELCs are 
not uniformly associated with EBV. The differential diagnosis for LELC varies per
site and depending on the site of occurrence may include lymphoepithelial
sialadenitis, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC), and large cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma. Treatment general includes combined (multimodality)
therapy including surgical resection, neck dissection, radiation therapy and/or
chemotherapy. The prognosis may vary per site overall favorable owing to a good
response to therapy.
