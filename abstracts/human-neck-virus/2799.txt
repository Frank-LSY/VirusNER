Laryngeal cancer in patients younger than 30 years is uncommon. We present data
on this population obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. We identified 99 patients in this
age group from the SEER 17 registry, which includes data submitted from 1973
through 2003. This population was made up of 52 females and 47 males; most were
white, and most were aged 25 to 29 years. Malignancies of the glottis were the
most common cancers, followed by supraglottic lesions. The 5-year relative
survival rate was lowest among those aged 15 to 19 years-60.1%; 5-year relative
survival among those aged 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 years was 87.7 and 87.4%,
respectively. The etiology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in children and
adolescents remains uncertain, but in the adult population, a history of smoking,
drinking, and poor oral hygiene cannot be ignored. Carcinoma of the larynx in
young people has been related to malignant degeneration of papillomas and to
complications of radiotherapy for papillomas. Infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus possibly accelerates the development of SCC in patients
with significant risk factors, presumably by impairing normal immune surveillance
mechanisms.
