The host innate immune response to influenza virus is a key determinant of
pathogenic outcomes and long-term protective immune responses against subsequent 
exposures. Here, we present a direct contrast of the host responses in primary
differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures following infection
with either a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (WT) or the antigenically-matched
live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV) strain. Comparison of the transcriptional profiles
obtained 24 and 36h post-infection showed that the magnitude of gene expression
was greater in LAIV infected relative to that observed in WT infected hNEC
cultures. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the antiviral and
inflammatory responses were largely driven by type III IFN induction in both WT
and LAIV infected cells. However, the enrichment of biological pathways involved 
in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and T
lymphocytes was uniquely observed in LAIV infected cells. These observations were
reflective of the host innate immune responses observed in individuals acutely
infected with influenza viruses. These findings indicate that cell-intrinsic type
III IFN-mediated innate immune responses in the nasal epithelium are not only
crucial for viral clearance and attenuation, but may also play an important role 
in the induction of protective immune responses with live-attenuated vaccines.
