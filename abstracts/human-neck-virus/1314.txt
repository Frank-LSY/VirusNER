BACKGROUND: Sexual behavior and oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are
risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The effects of OSCC
diagnosis and treatment on subsequent relationship stress and sexual behavior are
unknown.
METHODS: Incident cases of HPV-positive or HPV-negative OSCC in patients who had 
a partnered relationship and partners of patients with oropharyngeal cancer were 
eligible for a study in which surveys were administered at diagnosis and at the
6-month follow-up time point to assess relationship distress, HPV transmission
and concerns about health consequences, and sexual behavior. The frequency
distributions of responses, stratified by tumor HPV status, were compared at
baseline and follow-up.
RESULTS: In total, 262 patients with OSCC and 81 partners were enrolled. Among
the patients, 142 (54.2%) had HPV-positive OSCC, and 120 (45.8%) had HPV-negative
OSCC. Relationship distress was infrequently reported, and 69% of patients felt
that their relationship had strengthened since the cancer diagnosis. Both
HPV-positive patients (25%) and their partners (14%) reported feelings of guilt
or responsibility for the diagnosis of an HPV-caused cancer. Concern over sexual,
but not nonsexual, HPV transmission to partners was reported by 50%. Significant 
declines in the frequency of vaginal and oral sexual behaviors were reported at
follow-up, regardless of tumor HPV status. From baseline to 6 months, significant
increases in abstinence from vaginal sex (from 10% to 34%; P < .01) and oral sex 
(from 25% to 80%; P < .01) were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and treatment of OSCC are associated with significant
declines in the frequency of vaginal and oral sex, regardless of tumor HPV
status. Sexual behavior is an important quality-of-life outcome to assess within 
clinical trials. [See related editorial on pages 000-000, this issue.] Cancer
