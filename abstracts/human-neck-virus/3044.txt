The upregulation of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints hampers the immune response 
toward tumor cells and facilitates the tumor cells ability to evade
immunosurveillance. Specific inhibitory immune checkpoint delivers inhibitory
signals to T cells using multiple mechanisms. More in-depth understanding of the 
co-inhibitory immune checkpoints could be exploited for head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment. In this review, we summarize the expression and
the mechanism of partial co-inhibitory immune checkpoint signals and discuss
targeting co-inhibitory immune checkpoints as an immunotherapeutic target for
cancer therapy. This review may provide a better understanding of the
co-inhibitory immune checkpoints and could promote applications of immunotherapy.
