Merkel cell carcinomas are uncommon malignant tumors thought to originate from
the neuroendocrine cells of the skin that mainly affects sun-exposed body areas, 
particularly the head and neck. In approximately 10% of cases, they present with 
localized lymphadenopathy without any clinical evidence or history of a primary
lesion, but a truly primary lymph node Merkel cell carcinoma may occur, possibly 
originating from epithelial inclusions or an anomalous neuroendocrine
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. It has been observed that Merkel
cell carcinoma is more likely to affect patients whose immune status is impaired 
as a result of iatrogenic immunosuppression, human immunodeficiency virus
infection, or hematological malignancies. This study reports the case of a bona
fide primary Merkel cell carcinoma arising in an intraparotid lymph node of a
patient infected by HIV that had a particularly unfavorable clinical course.
