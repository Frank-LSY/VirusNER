We investigated the synergism between alcohol consumption and herpes simplex
virus (HSV) in the development of laryngeal squamous cell cancer and in the
clinical course of this disease. HSV DNA was searched by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) technique in the fresh tumor tissues of 22 patients with laryngeal
cancer without alcohol consumption (Group 1) and of 23 patients with chronic
alcohol consumption (Group 2), and their HSV prevalences were compared. No
statistically significant difference was detected between the two groups in terms
of HSV incidence frequency (P > 0.05), but the risk of finding HSV in tumor
tissue in patients with alcohol consumption history was 3.4-fold higher than in
those without alcohol consumption history (OR = 3.378, 95% CI = 0.762-14.982).
There were no statistically significant differences in terms of lymph node
metastasis, tumor localization, tumor diameter, tumor stage and tumor
differentiation between the patients in Group 1 and Group 2 (P > 0.05). Larger
case series will further elucidate the role of HSV in the development of
laryngeal cancer, the nature of its interactions with other carcinogens and its
effect on the clinical course.
