This study sought to identify and characterize the function of genes as
diagnostic markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC). The gene expression profile of GSE13597 was downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus database, which included 28 EBV-related NPC gene expression
profile data sets, 25 disease samples, and 3 control samples. Data were
pre-processed, and differentially expressed genes were screened using the R
language. The co-expression coefficient was calculated to construct a
co-expression network using Cytoscape. ClusterONE was used to perform module
analysis to find enriched gene families. The BiCAT software was used to perform a
two-way clustering analysis of differentially expressed gene expression profiles 
based on the co-expression networks and to verify the enriched gene families,
followed by functional enrichment analysis of these gene families. The MCM gene
family was found to be enriched in EBV-related NPC. This gene family is essential
for eukaryotic DNA replication. Functional analysis of differentially expressed
genes in the co-expression network revealed that the enriched biological
processes and pathways were mainly involved in the cell cycle. EBV-related NPC is
likely associated mainly with the process of cell reproduction, providing a
strong basis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of EBV-related NPC and 
a direction for targeted chemotherapy.
