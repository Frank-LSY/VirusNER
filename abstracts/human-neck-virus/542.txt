The effects of ATO on the cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle of HNSCC cells were analyzed using CCK-8 assay, colony formation and flow cytometry. Transwell assay was used to examine the effect of ATO on cell migration. The transcriptional and protein expression of key genes were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Using a xenograft model, we assessed the effects of ATO on HNSCC cells in vivo.
