BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) has an improved outcome and may allow for treatment
de-escalation. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection is associated with deregulated
expression of the cell cycle-associated proteins p16INK4, pRB, cyclin D1 and p53.
The objective of this study was to assess cell cycle proteins as potential
surrogate markers for HR-HPV DNA testing to identify OPSCC with favorable
prognosis after resection.
METHODS: Tissue microarray cores of 313 surgically treated OPSCC were stained for
p16INK4a, pRB, cyclin D1 and p53 using immunohistochemistry. Protein expression
was scored as high or low based on the proportion of positive carcinoma cells.
Tumor samples were analysed for HR-HPV DNA with polymerase chain reaction-based
testing. Associations between cell cycle protein expression and HR-HPV DNA status
were evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and
diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were
applied to evaluate associations between cell cycle protein expression and
patient outcome.
RESULTS: High expression of p16INK4a, cyclin D1, pRB and p53 in tumor cells were 
observed in 51.8%, 51.4%, 41.9% and 33.5% of OPSCC, respectively. HR-HPV DNA
positive were 158/313 (50.5%) tumor samples (HPV16: 147, HPV18: 1, HPV33: 5,
HPV35: 2, HPV56: 2, and HPV59: 1). P16INK4a showed a higher DOR to predict HR-HPV
DNA positivity than pRB, cyclin D1 and p53. Both the p16INK4a/pRB and the
p16INK4a/pRB/cyclin D1/p53 signatures had lower DOR than p16INK4a alone. Improved
5-year overall and disease-specific survival were associated with HR-HPV DNA
positivity, high p16INK4a, low pRB, low cyclin D1, and low p53 expression.
Associations with improved outcome were also observed for the marker combinations
high p16INK4a/positive HR-HPV DNA, high p16INK4a/low pRB and high p16INK4a/low
pRB/low cyclin D1/low p53. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, smoking
history, pT and pN category, high p16INK4a expression showed the lowest hazard
ratio for death.
CONCLUSIONS: High p16INK4a expression is a reliable marker for survival
prognostication in surgically treated OPSCC patients. Protein signatures
including the pRB, cyclin D1 and p53 proteins do not further increase the
prognostic performance of p16INK4a as a single marker.
