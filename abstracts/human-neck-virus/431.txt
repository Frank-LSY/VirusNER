BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether in children with
middle ear effusions (MEE), adenoid and tonsil tissues are associated with human 
bocavirus (HBoV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 124 patients (56 females (45.2%) and 68 males
(54.8%)) with chronic adenotonsillitis and serous otitis media under the age of
15 were recruited. Two hundered four samples (113 adenoid (55.4%), 68 tonsil
(33.3%), and 23 middle ear effusion (11.3%)) were analyzed for the presence of
HBoV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: HBoV was detected in only 6 (4.8%) adenoid tissue samples each belonging
to a different patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the results of other studies,
reporting approximately 5 - 10% of the samples being positive for HBoV. To
understand the detailed role of HBoV in the etiology of RTI in children, further 
studies would be needed.
