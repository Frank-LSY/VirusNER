OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of HPV in diffuse high grade pre-cancerous
lesions of the larynx.
METHODS: Patient charts were searched for those who presented between October
2008 and June 2009 with diffuse vocal fold leukoplakia. Biopsy proven laryngeal
lesions with high grade dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) were examined for
patient characteristics and presence of high-risk type HPV detected by in situ
hybridization technique.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients with precancerous lesions were identified. Average age 
was 63 years and 13 were male. One lesion was identified as positive for
high-risk HPV, all other lesions were negative. At current follow up, no patient 
has demonstrated progression to invasive carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: HPV may not play a role in non-progressing diffuse high-grade lesions
of the larynx.
