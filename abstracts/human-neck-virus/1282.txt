Chromatin alterations mediate mutations and gene expression changes in cancer.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been utilized
to study genome-wide chromatin structure in human cancer cell lines, yet numerous
technical challenges limit comparable analyses in primary tumors. Here we have
developed a new whole-genome analytic pipeline to optimize ChIP-Seq protocols on 
patient-derived xenografts from human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples. We further associated chromatin
aberrations with gene expression changes from a larger cohort of the tumor and
normal samples with RNA-Seq data. We detect differential histone enrichment
associated with tumor-specific gene expression variation, sites of HPV
integration in the human genome, and HPV-associated histone enrichment sites
upstream of cancer driver genes, which play central roles in cancer-associated
pathways. These comprehensive analyses enable unprecedented characterization of
the complex network of molecular changes resulting from chromatin alterations
that drive HPV-related tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 77(23); 6538-50. ©2017 AACR.
