Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute and chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV has also been associated 
with various common and uncommon glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy
(IgAN). We report a patient with chronic HBV infection who presented with
atypical features of IgAN with management and long-term follow-up. Much of the
data on the treatment of HBV-associated glomerular diseases come from patients
with membranous nephropathy, whereas the information on treatment of other
glomerulopathies remains largely anecdotal. To the best of our knowledge,
treatment of an adult patient with HBV-associated nephrotic syndrome from IgAN
with pegylated interferon has not been previously reported. Treatment with
pegylated interferon alfa-2b in our patient resulted in complete clinical
remission of the nephrotic syndrome as well as a dramatic decrease in HBV viral
load. Patient continued to remain in clinical remission 5Â years after treatment.
