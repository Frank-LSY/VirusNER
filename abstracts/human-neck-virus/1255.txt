In the effort to control human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer, the
head and neck oncology community has devoted much effort to understanding its
disease biology and clinical behavior, and refining strategies to address early
diagnosis and optimal management for the affected population. This review
identifies articles published up to March 2017 on tumor biology and clinical
implications of human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer, and summarizes
the findings in some key areas. These include potential screening strategies,
possible anatomical features responsible for early lymph node involvement and its
implication for staging, biological mechanisms to explain superior outcomes
compared to traditional nonviral-related mucosal cancers, re-appreciation of
traditional prognostic factors (eg, hypoxia, extranodal extension, and smoking), 
and current efforts to optimize management for this patient population. The
review reflects the global effort to mitigate the influence of this burgeoning
disease.
