BACKGROUND: In our first report on antibody levels in middle-aged and older men
with recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis (RLP), we reported increases in human
papillomavirus (HPV) antibody levels similar to those seen in adult women and
young men. We posited that HPV antibodies produced in laryngeal mucus by Gardasil
would prevent postoperative reinfection in patients with RLP.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a case series study.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether Gardasil injection
effectively inhibits recurrence of RLP. Specifically, in this second report,
whether HPV antibodies produced in laryngeal secretions by Gardasil are capable
of causing negative conversion of HPV-DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in laryngeal
mucosa was investigated.
METHODS: A total of 11 patients for whom antibodies were measured in the first
report were studied. Before vaccination and after 1 year Post-vaccination, HPV
screening tests were performed on laryngeal secretions, and whether HPV-DNA
negative conversion had occurred was evaluated. At the time of collection of
laryngeal secretions, the presence or absence of laryngeal papillomas was
examined.
RESULTS: Before vaccination, all patients were HPV low-risk positive on laryngeal
secretion screening tests. After vaccination, three patients were positive.
Laryngeal papillomas remained in five patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPV-DNA test showed negative conversion in eight of 11 (72.7%)
patients after vaccination. Residual laryngeal papillomas were found in five of
11 (45.5%) patients. The serum HPV antibody titer did not differ significantly
between the group in which laryngeal secretions showed HPV negative conversion
and the group in which conversion did not occur. The serum antibody titer did not
differ significantly as a function of whether there were residual tumors.
