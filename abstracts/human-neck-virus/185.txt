Negative HPV status and perineural invasion (PNI) were independent, additive factors associated with increased PDX formation. Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) human large B-cell lymphomas grew from 32% of HPV + HNSCC cases that failed to engraft. Successfully established HPV + PDXs retained basaloid histology and often developed cystic growth patterns typical of HPV + nodal metastases. They also maintained elevated p16
