Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small double-stranded DNA viruses that pose
significant public health concerns as the causative agent of approximately 5% of 
worldwide cancers. The HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 play key roles in carcinogenesis. 
In the last 15years there has been a significant increase in the incidence of
HPV-related head and neck cancers arising primarily in the oropharynx. Patients
with HPV-positive head and neck cancers (HNCs) have a significantly improved
prognosis compared to those with HPV-negative disease. In this review we will
discuss data suggesting how HPV oncogenes modulate both the intrinsic radiation
sensitivity of HNCs and also have important effects upon the tumor
microenvironment. Together, these findings contribute to the improved outcomes
seen in patients with HPV-positive HNC.
