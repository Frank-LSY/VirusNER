BACKGROUND: Comorbidity and anemia strongly influence treatment and outcome of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but respective data are frequently
lacking in clinical studies. We evaluated 149 cases of oropharyngeal SCC
primarily treated with surgery regarding the impact of these factors on
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
METHODS: Data were recorded during treatment and follow-up visits. Human
papillomavirus (HPV) association of oropharyngeal SCC was detected by p16
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Patients with p16-positive disease were significantly less comorbid and 
anemic, and treated more aggressively. Comorbidity and anemia, but not p16
status, significantly influenced DFS and had more impact on OS than p16 status.
CONCLUSION: In our study, p16-positive seems a good surrogate marker for
healthier patients. Patients with p16-positive disease showed improved survival, 
but this was limited to none/mild comorbid and/or nonanemic individuals in this
group. On the basis of our results, we strongly suggest the inclusion of these
factors in risk stratification for clinical studies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,
