Among HIV-infected patients, head and neck cancer incidence has increased over
the last few years. Head and neck cancer treatment in HIV-infected patients does 
not differ from the general population but those patients are exposed more
frequently to radiation severe toxic effects and need close monitoring during
chemoradiotherapy treatment. Close cooperation between oncologist and
infectiologist is crucial to eventually adjust antiretroviral therapy. Like
general population, HIV-infected patients should be advised to avoid excessive
alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking.
