Background: We have an incomplete understanding of the differences between cancer
stem cells (CSCs) in human papillomavirus-positive (HPV-positive) and -negative
(HPV-negative) head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). The PI3K pathway has
the most frequent activating genetic events in HNSCC (especially HPV-positive
driven), but the differential signaling between CSCs and non-CSCs is also
unknown.
Methods: We addressed these unresolved questions using CSCs identified from 10
HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Sored populations were serially passaged
in nude mice to evaluate tumorigenicity and tumor recapitulation. The
transcription profile of HNSCC CSCs was characterized by mRNA sequencing, and the
susceptibility of CSCs to therapy was investigated using an in vivo model. SOX2
transcriptional activity was used to follow the asymmetric division of
PDX-derived CSCs. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: CSCs were enriched by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and
CD44 expression and were similar between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases
(percent tumor formation injecting ≤ 1x10(3) cells: ALDH(+)CD44(high) = 65.8%,
ALDH(-)CD44(high) = 33.1%, ALDH(+)CD44(high) = 20.0%; and injecting 1x10(5)
cells: ALDH(-)CD44(low) = 4.4%). CSCs were resistant to conventional therapy and 
had PI3K/mTOR pathway overexpression (GSEA pathway enrichment, P < .001), and
PI3K inhibition in vivo decreased their tumorigenicity (40.0%-100.0% across
cases). PI3K/mTOR directly regulated SOX2 protein levels, and SOX2 in turn
activated ALDH1A1 (P < .001 013C and 067C) expression and ALDH activity (ALDH(+) 
[%] empty-control vs SOX2, 0.4% ± 0.4% vs 14.5% ± 9.8%, P = .03 for 013C and 1.7%
± 1.3% vs 3.6% ± 3.4%, P = .04 for 067C) in 013C and 067 cells. SOX2 enhanced
sphere and tumor growth (spheres/well, 013C P < .001 and 067C P = .04) and
therapy resistance. SOX2 expression prompted mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET) by inducing CDH1 (013C P = .002, 067C P = .01), followed by asymmetric
division and proliferation, which contributed to tumor formation.
Conclusions: The molecular link between PI3K activation and CSC properties found 
in this study provides insights into therapeutic strategies for HNSCC.
Constitutive expression of SOX2 in HNSCC cells generates a CSC-like population
that enables CSC studies.
