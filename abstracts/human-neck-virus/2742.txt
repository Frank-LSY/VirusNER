We present a case of cervical lymph node metastasis from an unknown primary
cancer that was controlled with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. The
patient, a 61-year-old man, was referred to our department for treatment of a
lesion in the left cervical lateral area. At the initial visit, the mass was
covered by reddened skin and was elastic, hard, and immobile on palpation. The
presence of a malignant disease such as malignant lymphoma or lymphadenitis
because of infection by tubercle bacillus or Epstein-Barr virus was suspected on 
the basis of the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Biopsy and
resection of the cervical mass was performed under general anesthesia. Because
the pathological diagnosis during surgery indicated squamous cell carcinoma, the 
surgical approach was changed to neck dissection. Head, neck, and thoracic
computed tomography and other examinations were performed to locate the primary
cancer, but its origin remained unknown. Postoperative therapy consisted of
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The patient has been followed up for 4 years and 
10 months without any evidence of recurrence.
