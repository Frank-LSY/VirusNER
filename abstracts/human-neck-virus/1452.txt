BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was
traditionally associated with smoking and alcohol use; however, human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection has recently been implicated as a novel risk
factor for oropharyngeal tumors. Furthermore, HPV-associated oropharyngeal
carcinoma (OPC) appears to be a distinct entity with different epidemiology,
biology, and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Here, we comprehensively review the existing data regarding HPV status
and prognostic or predictive outcomes in both the locoregionally advanced (LA)
and recurrent/metastatic (RM) disease setting and discuss ongoing trials that may
eventually impact the treatment of patients with HPV-positive (HPV+) SCCHN.
RESULTS: A body of retrospective and prospective data established an association 
between HPV+ OPC and better survival, particularly for LA disease. Current data
on RM disease are limited, but they also suggest prognostic significance for HPV.
CONCLUSIONS: Better outcomes in HPV+ LA disease may allow for less aggressive
treatment in the future, and several trials are evaluating deintensified regimens
in patients with HPV+, LA OPC; it should be emphasized that deintensification
strategies are appropriate only in a clinical research setting and only for
selected subgroups of HPV+ patients. In addition, HPV-targeted strategies, such
as vaccines, are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. On the other hand, the
prognostic impact of HPV in RM disease requires further validation before any
modifications in treatment can be made. Likewise, the predictive significance of 
HPV status in both disease settings remains to be defined.
