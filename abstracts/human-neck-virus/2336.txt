BACKGROUND: We examined the prognostic value of a panel of biomarkers in patients
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who were human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive (HIV-positive head and neck cancer) and HIV
negative (HIV-negative head and neck cancer).
METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using tumors from 41 disease 
site-matched and age-matched HIV-positive head and neck cancer cases and 44
HIV-negative head and neck cancer controls. Expression of tumor biomarkers was
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlations examined with clinical
variables.
RESULTS: Expression levels of the studied oncogenic and inflammatory tumor
biomarkers were not differentially regulated by HIV status. Among patients with
HIV-positive head and neck cancer, laryngeal disease site (P = .003) and
Clavien-Dindo classification IV (CD4) counts <200 cells/μL (P = .01) were
associated with poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that p16 positivity 
was associated with improved overall survival (OS; P < .001) whereas increased
expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) was associated with poor
clinical outcome (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Disease site has significant effect on the expression of biomarkers. 
Expression of tumor TGF-β could be a valuable addition to the conventional risk
stratification equation for improving head and neck cancer disease management
strategies.
