Human papillomavirus driven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
particularly oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), are characterized by 
a significant survival advantage over their HPV-negative counterparts. Although
the reasons behind this are still not fully elucidated, it is widely accepted
that these tumors have a higher response to ionizing radiation that might explain
their favorable outcomes. Potential underlying intrinsic mechanisms include
impaired DNA repair abilities, differences in activated repopulation-signaling
pathways and cell cycle control mechanisms. The role of the microenvironment is
increasingly highlighted, particularly tumor oxygenation and the immune response.
Recent studies have shown a distinct pattern of intratumoral immune cell
infiltrates, according to HPV status, and have suggested that an increased
cytotoxic T-cell based antitumor immune response is involved in improved
prognosis of patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. These significant milestones, in
the understanding of HPV-induced HNSCC, pave the way to new therapeutic
opportunities. This article reviews the current evidence on the biological basis 
of increased radiosensitivity in HPV-positive HNSCC and discusses potential
therapeutic implications.
