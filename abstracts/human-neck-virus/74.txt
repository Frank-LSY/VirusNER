Human papilloma viruses (HPV), members of the papillomaviridae family, infects
squamous epithelial cells of cevix, lower genitalia, and oral cavity. The
association of HPV with oropharyngeal carcinogenesis is well documented.The
incidence of oral cancer ranks second in Karachi South in both genders according 
to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. This is attributed to the
popularity of chewable tobacco products among the general population. Studies on 
Gutka-eaters in a set population of Karachi showed high frequency of HPV (17%)
and high prevalence of HPV in squamous cell carcinoma in Pakistani patients
(68%). The exposure of oral mucosa to chewable tobacco causes abrasions making it
susceptible to HPV. This review strives to summarise the role of HPV in chewable 
tobacco-related precancerous and cancerous lesions. The literature of about a
decade was retrieved from Google and pubMed with the under mentioned key words.
It was found that the use of chewable tobacco products, especially Gutka, may
increase the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
