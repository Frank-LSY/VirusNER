BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests the incidence of oral tongue squamous cell
carcinoma is increasing in young patients, many who have no history of tobacco
use.
METHODS: We clinically reviewed 89 patients with oral tongue cancer. Exomic
sequencing of tumor DNA from 6 nonsmokers was performed and compared to
previously sequenced cases. RNA from 20 tumors was evaluated by massively
parallel sequencing to search for potentially oncogenic viruses.
RESULTS: Non-smokers (53 of 89) were younger than smokers (36 of 89; mean, 50.4
vs 61.9 years; p < .001), and seemed more likely to be women (58.5% vs 38.9%;
p = .069). Nonsmokers had fewer TP53 mutations (p = .02) than smokers. No
tumor-associated viruses were detected.
CONCLUSION: The young age of nonsmoking patients with oral tongue cancer and
fewer TP53 mutations suggest a viral role in this disease. Our efforts to
identify such a virus were unsuccessful. Further studies are warranted to
elucidate the drivers of carcinogenesis in these patients.
