Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) cause mild upper respiratory infections,
gastrointestinal symptoms, central nervous system infections and some studies
have linked them with acute otitis media (AOM). The aim of the present study was 
to study further the role of HPeV infections in AOM by detecting these viruses
directly from middle ear fluid (MEF), respiratory and stool samples collected
from children during AOM episodes. A total of 91 MEF samples, 98 nasal swab (NS) 
samples and 92 stool samples were collected during 100 AOM episodes in a total of
87 children aged between five to 42 months. All specimens were analyzed by real
time RT-PCR for the presence of HPeV RNA. HPeV infection was diagnosed in 12
(14%) patients. HPeV RNA was detected in altogether 13 samples, including four
MEF samples, three NS samples and six stool samples. One patient was positive in 
both stool and MEF samples. The results suggest that HPeV may play a role in some
AOM cases, but it is not a major cause of AOM in children.
