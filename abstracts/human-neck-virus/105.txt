Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recently recognised as a carcinogenic factor 
for a subset of head and neck cancers (HNC). In Europe, France has one of the
highest incidence rates of HNC. The aim of this study is to explore changes in
HNC incidence in France, potentially in relation with infection by HPV. HNC were 
classified into two anatomical groups: potentially HPV-related and HPV-unrelated.
Trends over the period 1980-2012 were analysed by an age-period-cohort model
based on data from eleven French cancer registries. Among men, the
age-standardised incidence rate (ASR) of HNC decreased in both groups, but less
so for HPV-related sites as compared to unrelated sites, especially in recent
years (annual percentage change [APC] over the period 2005-2012: -3.5% vs.
-5.4%). Among women, the ASR increased in both groups, but more rapidly for
HPV-related as compared to unrelated sites (APC over the period 2005-2012: +1.9% 
vs. -0.4%). This preferential growth of HPV-related versus unrelated HNC was
observed in the cohorts born from 1930 to 1935. The differences in trends between
possible HPV-related and HPV-unrelated sites suggest an increasing incidence of
HNC due to HPV infection. The difference was less marked in men as compared to
women, most likely because of a higher contamination in the HPV-related group by 
cancers due to tobacco or alcohol consumption. The pattern observed is consistent
with observations made in other countries, with studies of HPV prevalence in HNC 
and the evolution of sexual behaviour in France.
