The interesting history of papillomavirus (PV) research has been reviewed before.
The history of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck region starts in 1901 
when the contagious transmission of warty lesions into the mouth via oral sex was
described, although the confirmation of their viral etiology had to wait until
1907. Ullman was the first to associate the human wart virus with laryngeal
warts. Parsons and Kidd described the natural history of oral PV infections in
rabbits already in 1942, but these findings were corroborated in humans only
recently. Koilocytotic atypia described by Koss and Durfee in 1956 was recognized
as a sign of HPV infection in cervical precancer lesions only in 1976-1977
(Meisels and Fortin; Purola and Savia). This prompted systematic surveys of head 
and neck lesions for the detection of koilocytosis since the late 1970s, and the 
authors of this communication were the first to propose the HPV involvement in a 
subgroup of head and neck cancers. Brandsma and Abramson demonstrated HPV16 DNA
in tonsillar SCCs in 1989. Since the early 2000s, HPV research of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has made impressive progress, confirming that
the specific anatomic site plays a key role in determining the susceptibility to 
HPV infection. The most likely cancer sites associated with HPV are the base of
the tongue and palatine tonsils, followed by oral cavity, larynx, and sinonasal
mucosa. There is substantial geographic variation in HPV association with HNSCC. 
Patients with HPV-associated HNSCC are younger, and survival is better than in
the absence of HPV.
