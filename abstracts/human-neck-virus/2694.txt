OBJECTIVES: Head and neck cancer is frequent in the Inuit population of Greenland
and is characterized by a very high incidence of Epstein-Barr virus associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, information on the treatment and
survival of Inuit head and neck cancer patients is practically non-existent. The 
aim of this study, therefore, was to analyse the epidemiological pattern, time
course and survival of head and neck cancer patients in Greenland.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective register-based study.
METHODS: The Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Cancer Registry and
hospital-based registries were used to identify all patients resident in
Greenland diagnosed with head and neck cancer during the period 1994-2003. Data
were analysed with regard to clinical characteristics, treatment delay and
survival.
RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were identified. The age-standardized incidence 
rate for all head and neck cancer cases was 28/100,000 for males and 19/100,000
for females. High incidence rates were found for NPC and oral cancers. Of all
cancers, 47% were stage IV at the time of diagnosis, while 61% of all NPC's were 
stage IV. The median delay from date of first symptom to treatment was 248 days
for all cancers. The overall crude 5-year survival rate for all sites together
was 35% and for NPC 20%.
CONCLUSION: Survival of head and neck cancer in Greenland is very low. Delays in 
treatment and inadequate follow-up on treatment complications are probable
causes. The improvements in treatment for NPC and other head and neck cancer
cases over the last decades are yet to be seen in this Inuit population.
