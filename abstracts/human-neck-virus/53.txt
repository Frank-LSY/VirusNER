The majority of civil research studies on HPV-associated head and neck cancers are concentrated on clinical studies. Thus, the molecular neuropathology and signaling pathway of HPV should be further explored in the future to advance prognostic methods. Moreover, the perspective view of therapeutic vaccines and molecular-targeting treatments should receive close attention. â€©.
