Cases of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck cancers are rapidly increasing in the United States. Little is known about the economic burden of these cancers. A literature review identified 7 studies that characterized aspects of the overall economic burden of HPV-associated head and neck cancers in the United States. Other cost studies are detailed to highlight the clinical reality in treating these patients. As the clinical awareness of the role of HPV in head and neck cancers continues, the economic impact of cancers caused by this virus will have implications for the role of various preventive measures.
