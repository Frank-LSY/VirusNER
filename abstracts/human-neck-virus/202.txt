This article outlines the biology of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of
human mucosa and the cellular pathways that are altered through viral infection. 
The article provides a conceptual framework with which to understand the 2 major 
immunologic strategies to address HPV-related diseases: (1) prevention of primary
HPV infection through the use of prophylactic vaccines and (2) treatment of
established infection and diseases through therapeutic vaccines. Nonimmunologic
therapy that targets cellular dysregulation induced by HPV infection is also
discussed. The challenges in actualizing these conceptually attractive therapies 
on both a societal and biological level are examined.
