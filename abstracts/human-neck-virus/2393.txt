OBJECTIVE: To assess the bone mineral density (BMD) in a cohort of men with
primary HIV-1 infection (PHI).
METHODS: Thirty-three men with PHI had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip. Osteopenia and osteoporosis were
defined according to WHO criteria as T-scores between -1 and -2.5 and -2.5 or
less, respectively. The association between clinical and laboratory parameters
and BMD was investigated using multivariable linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Mean age was 38 (SD 9) years and mean body mass index (BMI) 22.7 (SD
3.3) kg/m. Twenty-four men (73%) had a negative or indeterminate Western blot, 32
men (97%) were combination antiretroviral therapy-naive. Mean plasma HIV-1 RNA
was 5.0 (SD 1.2) log10 copies/ml. Mean lumbar spine T (-0.8, SD 1.3, P = 0.001)
and Z-scores (-0.7, SD 1.3, P = 0.004) and femoral neck T-score (-0.5, SD 0.9, P 
= 0.003) were significantly lower compared to the reference population. 15/33 men
(45%) had osteopenia and 2/33 (6%) osteoporosis. Markers of bone turnover did not
differ between patients with or without osteopenia/osteoporosis. Age was
negatively associated with femoral neck (beta-coefficient = -0.05, P < 0.001) and
total hip T-scores (beta = -0.03, P = 0.04). BMI was associated with lumbar spine
(beta = 0.3), femoral neck (beta = 0.2) and total hip (beta = 0.2) T-scores (P < 
0.001) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with lumbar spine (beta = 0.5, P =
0.045) and femoral neck T-scores (beta = 0.4, P = 0.005). Increased plasma viral 
load was associated with lower total hip T-scores (beta = -0.2, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced BMD was prevalent in PHI men and was associated with
increased age, lower BMI and TSH levels, and higher levels of HIV-1 viremia.
