Oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers account for 75% of head and neck cancers and
are the fourth most spread cancer in men. Their incidence has decreased since
1980 in men (incidence from 2011 gives 13,930 for lip, oral cavity, pharyngeal
and laryngeal carcinomas) but has increased in women, linked to the more recent
smoking or alcohol intoxication in women. In addition to the smoking or alcohol
consumption risk factors, the EBV role in nasopharyngeal carcinomas, HPV in the
oropharyngeal carcinomas and professional exposures in paranasal sinuses cancers 
are recognized. Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer in men
mortality in France. Extended anatomical sites reflect the diagnostic's
complexity specific to some locations (sinuses, nasopharynx), possible therapies 
and prognosis depending on the affected site.
