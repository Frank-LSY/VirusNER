Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive bone
marrow failure and a predisposition to cancers. Mutations have been documented in
15 FA genes that participate in the FA-BRCA DNA repair pathway, a fundamental
pathway in the development of the disease and the presentation of its
characteristic symptoms. Certain symptoms such as oxygen sensitivity,
hematological abnormalities and impaired immunity suggest that FA proteins could 
participate in or independently control other pathways as well. In this study, we
identified 9 DNA repair genes that were down regulated in a genome wide analysis 
of 6 Indian Fanconi anemia patients. Functional clustering of a total of 233
dysregulated genes identified key biological processes that included regulation
of transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle and chromosomal organization. Microarray
data revealed the down regulation of ATXN3, ARID4A and ETS-1, which were
validated by RTPCR in a subsequent sample set of 9 Indian FA patients. Here we
report for the first time a gene expression profile of Fanconi anemia patients
from the Indian population and a pool of genes that might aid in the acquisition 
and progression of the FA phenotype.
