At the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015,
results of current trials dealing with nonsurgical primary treatment of locally
advanced head and neck cancer were presented. Regarding concomitant
chemoradiotherapy (CRT), studies focused on the dosage and sequence of cisplatin 
administration are currently particularly featured. Amongst these, a study on
dosage reduction in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive patients was presented. 
Other investigations addressed substances as alternatives for cisplatin,
particularly carboplatin and targeted therapeutic agents. The comparison of
concomitant and sequential CRT (induction chemotherapy (ICT) prior to CRT) is
still one of the main topics. In addition, studies modifying the ICT regimen or
combining subsequent radiotherapy (RT) with the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) antibody cetuximab were presented. A selection of the most important
trials are summarized in this article.
