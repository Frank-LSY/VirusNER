BACKGROUND: Surgical therapy for early oropharyngeal carcinoma leads to excellent
oncologic results but often requires adjuvant radiotherapy. The purpose of this
study was to identify prognostic factors that worsen the outcome of limited
oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with surgery ± adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-six patients were retrospectively evaluated between
1980 and 2007.
RESULTS: Overall 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was 88.7% and local
control (LC) was 93.3%. The univariate analysis showed a significant difference
in DSS between pT1 and pT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma (DSS, 94.0% vs 81.2%; p =
.008) and patients with tumor depth greater than 5 mm (DSS, 94.5% vs 78.9%; p =
.031). No difference could be found as to N classification, marginal status, p16 
human papillomavirus (HPV) status, type of treatment, and adjuvant radiotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Primary surgical treatment is an effective therapy of limited
oropharyngeal carcinoma. Patients with pT2 status and tumor depth of more than 5 
mm show a significantly worse survival rate and should be further investigated in
future clinical trials.
