OBJECTIVE: The objective was to report our experience with advanced stage
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated sequentially with induction
chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review identified 49 eligible patients with advanced
stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy
followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. HPV and p16(INK4A) testing was
performed on pathology specimens. Follow-up of over 11 months was required unless
a death or treatment failure occurred before that time.
RESULTS: Treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent
chemoradiotherapy resulted in 44/48 (90%) complete durable response. One death
occurred from pulmonary embolism. Toxicity profiles were comparable to other
published data. Average follow-up was 3.9 years. Oncologic failure rates among
subgroups showed 5.7% failure for HPV+/p16+ cancer, 9.1% failure for HPV-/p16+
cancer, 100% failure for HPV-/p16- cancer, 0% failure for nonsmokers, and 17.9%
failure for smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed favorable outcomes in terms of durable oncologic
response and acceptable toxicity profiles. It is notable that 36/49 patients were
HPV+/p16+ and 11/49 were HPV-/p16+. Only 2 patients were HPV-/p16-, and both died
as a result of oncologic failures. This highlights the importance of obtaining
HPV and p16 testing in studies evaluating the efficacy of treatments for
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
