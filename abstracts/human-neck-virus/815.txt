The encapsulation of Ad with SELP hydrogels sustained biological activity longer than Ad alone. Ad in SELP matrix showed 1.5-fold greater antitumor efficacy compared to that of naked Ad in human xenograft tumor models. Histological analysis demonstrated that treatment with Ad in a SELP matrix resulted in apoptosis in a wider area of tumor tissue and higher density of Ad infection compared to Ad administered alone.
