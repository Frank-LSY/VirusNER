CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify any strong associations between HPV-16 viral
load and any of the clinical or lifestyle factors.
OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of oropharyngeal SCC is changing, with an increasing 
proportion of HPV-positive cases seen in the last decade. It is known that a high
viral load is linked to the development of cervical cancer, the relation between 
viral load and oropharyngeal SCC is less clear. We sought to determine HPV-16
viral load in HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs using highly sensitive digital PCR 
and to identify clinical and lifestyle factors associated with viral load.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analysed 45 HPV-16 positive oropharyngeal SCCs diagnosed
between 2013 and 2015. All patients completed a lifestyle questionnaire and
clinical data were extracted from medical charts. Viral load was determined using
digital PCR assays for HPV-L1 and RNAseP.
RESULTS: We found large variations in HPV-16 viral load from 1 to 930 copies per 
cell (median 34 copies per cell).
