Age-related EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is a highly
aggressive lymphoma, and a standard therapy for this disease has not yet been
established. A 58-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of fever and
lymphadenopathy across the whole body. Neck lymph node biopsy showed hemorrhagic 
and geographic necrosis with Hodgkin-like large cells against a background of
small lymphocytes. The large cells were positive for CD30 and EBER. The patient
was diagnosed as having age-related EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorder. Although there was no response to CHOP therapy, he obtained partial
response after 3 courses of DeVIC therapy. Because his lymphoma was highly
aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant, he underwent autologous stem cell
transplantation with a conditioning regimen including ranimustine, etoposide,
cytarabine, and melphalan. After stem cell transplantation and subsequent
radiotherapy to the residual lesion, the patient achieved complete remission.
This is the first report of successful autologous stem cell transplantation for a
patient with age-related EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
