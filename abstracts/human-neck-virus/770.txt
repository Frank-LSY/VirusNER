OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the clinical value of
18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG
PET/CT) after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy (IC) in locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, single-arm, single center study was
performed, with patients enrolled between February 2010 and July 2013.Patients (n
= 49) with stage III/IVA-B LASCCHN who underwent IC with taxanes, cisplatin, and 
fluorouracil were recruited. Staging procedures included loco-regional and chest 
imaging, endoscopic examination, and PET/CT scan. On day 14 of the first cycle, a
second PET/CT scan was performed. Patients with no early increase in regional
lymph node maximum 18F-FDG standard uptake value (SUV), detected using 18F-FDG
PET/CT after first IC had better progression-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) =
0.18, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.056-0.585; p = 0.004) and overall survival 
(HR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.040-0.498; p = 0.002), and were considered responders. In
this subgroup, patients who achieved a reduction of ≥ 45% maximum primary tumor
SUV experienced improved progression-free (HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.062-0.854; p =
0.028) and overall (HR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.013-0.96; p = 0.046) survival.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for early response evaluation
with PET/CT examination in patients with LASCCHN undergoing IC. Increased
regional lymph node maximum SUV and insufficient decrease in primary tumor uptake
predict poorer outcomes.
