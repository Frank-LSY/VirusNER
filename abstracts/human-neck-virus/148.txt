DNA expressions of EBV, HBoV, polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV were investigated in children with chronic tonsillar and adenoidal diseases using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The patients were grouped as follows: adenoid, recurrent tonsillitis and hypertrophic tonsillitis group. The relationships of the expressions of these viruses with age, gender, recurrent infection and airway obstruction were also analyzed. Seasonal variations in rates of detection of these viruses in adenoid and tonsil tissues were also investigated.
