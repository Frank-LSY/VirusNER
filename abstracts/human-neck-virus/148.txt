OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate outcomes for patients with pathological N3
(pN3) neck disease from human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and determine variables predictive of survival.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series with chart review.
METHODS: This study was conducted between 1998 and 2013 and included patients
with HPV-related OPSCC treated with surgery with or without adjuvant therapy and 
who had pN3 nodal disease. The primary outcome was disease-specific survival
(DSS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival
(DFS), adverse events, and gastrostomy tube rates.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included, of whom 36 (90%) underwent adjuvant 
therapy. Median follow-up was 39 months (range, 2-147 months). Mean age was 56
years, and 87% were male. Seventeen patients (44%) underwent selective neck
dissection, whereas six (15%) underwent radical (n = 2) or extended radical
(n = 4) neck dissection. Ninety-two percent had extracapsular extension.
Five-year Kaplan-Meier estimated DSS, OS, and DFS were 89% (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 79%-99%), 87% (95% CI: 75%-99%), and 84% (95% CI: 72%-96%),
respectively. The disease recurrence rate was 10% (5% regional, 5% distant
metastasis). Patients with less than 5 pathologically positive lymph nodes
(P = .041) had improved DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPV-related OPSCC and pN3 nodal disease treated with
surgery and adjuvant therapy have very favorable long-term survival and regional 
control. Patients with five or more pathologically positive lymph nodes may be at
higher risk for recurrence.
