Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a major risk factor for a distinct
subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The current review
summarizes the epidemiology of HNSCC and the disease burden, the infectious cycle
of HPV, the roles of viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, and the downstream cellular
events that lead to malignant transformation. Current techniques for the clinical
diagnosis of HPV-associated HNSCC will also be discussed, that is, the detection 
of HPV DNA, RNA, and the HPV surrogate marker, p16 in tumor tissues, as well as
HPV-specific antibodies in serum. Such methods do not allow for the early
detection of HPV-associated HNSCC and most cases are at an advanced stage upon
diagnosis. Novel noninvasive approaches using oral fluid, a clinically relevant
biological fluid, allow for the detection of HPV and cellular alterations in
infected cells, which may aid in the early detection and HPV-typing of HNSCC
tumors. Noninvasive diagnostic methods will enable early detection and
intervention, leading to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity
associated with HNSCC.
