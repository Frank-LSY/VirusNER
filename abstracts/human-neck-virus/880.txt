Thirty-one patients (30.1%) were positive for HPV infection. The most frequent HPV types were types 16 (16 patients, 51.6%) and 18 (seven patients, 22.6%). HPV infection was not associated with tumor aggressiveness (pathological tumor stage or differentiation status), risk exposure (alcohol, cigarette, or areca quid chewing habit), or the treatment outcome (disease-free survival or overall survival). However, infection with HPV-18 was associated with the occurrence of a second primary cancers (P = 0.033), indicating the infection of HPV in OSCC enhances the susceptibility of developing secondary malignancy.
