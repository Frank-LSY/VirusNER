PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the radiation response of cancer stem cells 
(CSCs) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) differs and is not reflected in the radiation
response of the bulk tumor populations, that radiation therapy (RT) can
dedifferentiate non-stem HNSCC cells into CSCs, and that radiation-induced
dedifferentiation depends on the HPV status.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records of a cohort of 162 HNSCC patients were reviewed,
and their outcomes were correlated with their HPV status. Using a panel of
HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines expressing a reporter for CSCs, we
characterized HPV-positive and HPV-negative lines via flow cytometry,
sphere-forming capacity assays in vitro, and limiting dilution assays in vivo.
Non-CSCs were treated with different doses of radiation, and the
dedifferentiation of non-CSCs into CSCs was investigated via flow cytometry and
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for re-expression of
reprogramming factors.
RESULTS: Patients with HPV-positive tumors have superior overall survival and
local-regional control. Human papillomavirus-positive HNSCC cell lines have lower
numbers of CSCs, which inversely correlates with radiosensitivity. Human
papillomavirus-negative HNSCC cell lines lack hierarchy owing to enhanced
spontaneous dedifferentiation. Non-CSCs from HPV-negative lines show enhanced
radiation-induced dedifferentiation compared with HPV-positive lines, and RT
induced re-expression of Yamanaka reprogramming factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Supporting the favorable prognosis of HPV-positive HNSCCs, we show
that (1) HPV-positive HNSCCs have a lower frequency of CSCs; (2) RT can
dedifferentiate HNSCC cells into CSCs; and (3) radiation-induced
dedifferentiation depends on the HPV status of the tumor.
