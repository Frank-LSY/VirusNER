Elevated levels of circulating cell-free Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA have been
detected in plasma and serum samples from nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients by
quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) test. This qPCR test for circulating EBV DNA
was found to be useful in the clinical management of NPC patients. For instance, 
EBV DNA qPCR test has good sensitivity and specificity in the detection of NPC at
disease onset. Increase of the viral DNA load was found in NPC patients at late
stages of disease. High EBV DNA load at disease onset or detectable viral load
post-treatment was associated with poor survival or frequent relapse in NPC
patients. Residual EBV DNA load after primary treatment could be a useful
indicator to justify adjuvant chemotherapy. The qPCR test might also be applied
to define a poor prognostic group in patients at early stage (I/II) for
implementing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (chemo-RT) to improve patients'
outcome. The test is also useful to monitor distant metastases or response to
radiotherapy, chemo-RT or surgery. Supplementary tests, however, are needed to
pick up EBV negative WHO type I NPC and test improvement is needed to increase
sensitivity in detecting stage I disease and local recurrence.
