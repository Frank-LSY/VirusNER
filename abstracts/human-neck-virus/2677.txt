The objectives of our study was to review our current knowledge of the
etiopathogenesis of otosclerotic bone remodeling including genetics, viral
infection, autoimmunity and inflammation and to discuss disease pathogenesis with
relevance to pharmacotherapy. Relevant publications on the etiopathogenesis,
molecular biology, genetics and histopathology of otosclerosis from 1984 to 2009 
were analyzed. Otosclerosis is a bone remodeling disorder of the human otic
capsule; however, the etiopathogenesis remains unclear. Genetic predisposition,
disturbed bone metabolism, persistent measles virus infection, autoimmunity, and 
hormonal and environmental factors also may play contributing roles in the
pathogenesis of otosclerosis. Since diagnosis of otosclerosis is still based on
histopathological examination of the removed stapes footplate, systemic
prospective studies based on comprehensive histopathological and molecular
biological analysis are necessary to obtain further information on the background
of the disease.
