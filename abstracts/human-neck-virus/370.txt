Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the
oropharynx is a powerful predictive and prognostic biomarker. We describe how the
use of next-generation sequencing can provide a novel method for the detection of
HPV in DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Using this
methodology in a cohort of 44 head and neck tumors, we identified the samples
that contained HPV sequences, the viral subtype involved, and a direct readout of
viral load. Specificity of HPV detection by sequencing compared to traditional
detection methods using either PCR or p16 immunohistochemistry was 100%.
Sensitivity was 50% when either compared to PCR [confidence interval (CI) = 29%
to 71%] or 75% when compared to p16 (CI = 47% to 91%). In addition, we
demonstrate the ability of next-generation sequencing to detect other HPV
subtypes that would not have been detected by traditional methods, and we
demonstrated the ability to apply this method to any tumor and any virus in a
panel of eight human cancer cell lines. This methodology also provides a tumor
genomic copy number karyogram, and in the samples analyzed here, a lower level of
chromosome instability was detected in HPV-positive tumors compared to
HPV-negative tumors, as observed in previous studies. Thus, the use of
next-generation sequencing for the detection of HPV provides a multiplicity of
data with clinical significance in a single test.
