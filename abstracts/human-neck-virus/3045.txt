PROBLEM: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a potentially
fatal complication after solid organ transplantation. The majority of cases are
associated with Epstein Barr virus infection (EBV). The first manifestations of
PTLD are frequently observed in the ENT area with adenoidal and/or tonsillar
enlargement.
METHODOLOGY: We present the case of a 12-year old girl with a total nasal
obstruction and tonsillitis five months after a kidney transplantation for
bilateral congenital kidney hypoplasia.
RESULTS: The EBV genome was detected by polymerase reaction three months after
surgery. Fiberoptic examination revealed an obstructive necrotic mass in the
naso-pharynx. The anatomic-pathologic analysis revealed necrotic adenoids.
CONCLUSIONS: Necrotic tonsillitis is common. Necrosis of the adenoids, although
rarer, can also occur and explains the important respiratory distress. Since two 
thirds of PTLD patients present with clinical symptoms in the ENT area, the
otorhinolaryngologist should be aware of this complication.
