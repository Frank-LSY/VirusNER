In this report we describe a case in which a previously healthy 7 year-old male
developed acute epiglottitis secondary to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.
This patient required fiberoptic intubation and ICU stay. We discuss epiglottitis
diagnosis and management with EBV as the primary etiologic agent.
