The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing
despite a decrease in tobacco use. Almost 20-30% of patients with OPSCC do not
have the traditional risk factors of smoking and alcohol use and in a vast
majority of these patients, the human papilloma virus (HPV) appears to drive the 
malignant transformation. HPV induced malignant transformation is attributed to
two viral oncogenes and their non-structural protein products (E6 and E7). These 
two proteins appear to affect carcinogenesis by their inhibitory effects on p53
and retinoblastoma proteins (Rb). Patients with HPV mediated OPSCC seem to have a
better prognosis compared to their non-HPV counterparts. However, in the absence 
of strong evidence, standard of care at this time for OPSCC does not differ based
on HPV status. Current research is focused on the role of de-escalation of
treatment and elucidation of prognostic markers in this unique population. This
review focuses on the pathogenesis of HPV mediated OPSCC and details the current 
evidence in the management of these patients.
