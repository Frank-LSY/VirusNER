Almost all acquire a genital HPV infection at some point in their life. Oral
infections are also common. The majority of the infections are asymptomatic and
get cleared, spontaneously. There are 180 HPV genotypes, of which HPV16 is the
main cause of cervical cancer in addition to other carcinomas. HPV-related
oropharyngeal cancer incidence has almost tripled in the last 30 years in
Finland. Of the eight genes of HPV, E6 and E7 are the most important oncogenes.
HPV vaccinations have been effective in reducing female genital and anal
dysplastic lesions, but their effectiveness on head and neck infections requires 
further research.
