Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are important tumor suppressors whose
best-characterized function is repair of damaged nuclear DNA. Here, we describe
an essential role for FA genes in two forms of selective autophagy. Genetic
deletion of Fancc blocks the autophagic clearance of viruses (virophagy) and
increases susceptibility to lethal viral encephalitis. Fanconi anemia
complementation group C (FANCC) protein interacts with Parkin, is required
in vitro and in vivo for clearance of damaged mitochondria, and decreases
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammasome
activation. The mitophagy function of FANCC is genetically distinct from its role
in genomic DNA damage repair. Moreover, additional genes in the FA pathway,
including FANCA, FANCF, FANCL, FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2, are required for
mitophagy. Thus, members of the FA pathway represent a previously undescribed
class of selective autophagy genes that function in immunity and organellar
homeostasis. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis 
of FA and cancers associated with mutations in FA genes.
