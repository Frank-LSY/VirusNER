The pathology laboratory has a central role in providing human papillomavirus
(HPV) tests for patients with head and neck cancer. There is an extensive
literature around HPV testing and a large number of proprietary HPV tests, which 
makes the field difficult to navigate. This review provides a concise
contemporary overview of the evidence around HPV testing in head and neck cancer 
and signposts key publications, guideline documents and the most commonly used
methods in clinical practice.
