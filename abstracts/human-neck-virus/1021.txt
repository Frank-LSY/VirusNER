Reservoirs of infectious HIV-1 persist despite years of combination
antiretroviral therapy and make curing HIV-1 infections a major challenge. Most
of the proviral DNA resides in CD4(+)T cells. Some of these CD4(+)T cells are
clonally expanded; most of the proviruses are defective. It is not known if any
of the clonally expanded cells carry replication-competent proviruses. We report 
that a highly expanded CD4(+) T-cell clone contains an intact provirus. The
highly expanded clone produced infectious virus that was detected as persistent
plasma viremia during cART in an HIV-1-infected patient who had squamous cell
cancer. Cells containing the intact provirus were widely distributed and
significantly enriched in cancer metastases. These results show that clonally
expanded CD4(+)T cells can be a reservoir of infectious HIV-1.
