BACKGROUND: The study aimed to identify prognostic markers to improve the
management of patients with HPV positive OSCC Methods: We determined the ratio of
HPV E6*I and E6*II splice variants by quantitative RT-PCR in 177 HPV positive
OSCC and correlated the findings with other clinicopathological data Results:
There was no significant difference in locoregional recurrence (HR 1.72 p = 0.24)
and death (HR 1.65, p = 0.13) among patients whose tumors had an E6*I/*II ratio
≥1 compared with an E6*I/*II ratio of <1. Univariate analysis showed that
patients with E6*I/*II ≥1 OSCC were more likely to have an event. In the
multivariable analysis, there was a trend for more events in patients with
E6*I/*II ratio ≥1 (HR 1.70, 95% CI 0.95-3.03, p = 0.07) CONCLUSION: Our data
suggest that the use of HPV 16 spliced transcripts may help to predict for poorer
outcomes in patients with HPV positive OSCC.
