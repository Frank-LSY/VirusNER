BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need to improve outcomes for patients with
locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN),
especially in Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) negative and HPV positive subtypes with
a significant history of tobacco use. In animal models bearing SCCHN, Cabazitaxel
showed an excellent response rate compared to docetaxel and might prove useful in
treatment of patients. The primary objective of this study was to determine the
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cabazitaxel when
combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) in induction chemotherapy (IC)
for patients with SCCHN. Cabazitaxel-PF IC administered in 3 cycles (each 21
days) followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) or surgery has been evaluated
to assess overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) in this
population.
METHODS: This phase I study employed a standard 3+3 design. DLT was defined as
grade 4 or 5 toxicity or grade 3 toxicity lasting >7days. Out of 40 consented
patients with stage IV, curable, previously untreated, LA-SCHHN and poor
prognosis, 35 (32M, 3F) were enrolled and evaluated for toxicity: 19 oropharynx, 
10 larynx, 2 oral cancer, 1 nasopharynx and 3 hypopharynx. Five dose levels of
cabazitaxel (10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20mg/m2) were tested in combination with
cisplatin 100mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 800mg/m2/d×4days. Dose escalation
for cabazitaxel was terminated upon the occurrences of 2 DLTs and the
establishment of MTD. Cabazitaxel was then further escalated with cisplatin
75mg/m2 and 5-FU 800mg/m2/d×4days in the subsequent 3 dose levels (17.5, 20 and
22.5mg/m2). In the expansion cohort, 9 patients were enrolled at the 22.5mg/m2
dose level. Following 3 cycles of IC, patients were evaluated for clinical,
radiographic, and pathologic response to cabazitaxel-PF before beginning CRT or
surgery.
RESULTS: There were two DLTs (grade 4 hyperuricemia; neutropenic fever, sepsis,
and grade 4 thrombocytopenia) among 2 patients in cohort 5 at the dose of 20mg/m2
of cabazitaxel. There were no DLTs reported with cohorts using a lower dose of
cisplatin, even in the expansion cohort. The study was stopped at the dose of
22.5mg/m2 in accordance with the initial study design. With 33 evaluable patients
for response, the Overall Response Rate (ORR) rate was 57.6%: 9.1% Complete
Responses (CR) and 48.5% Partial Responses (PR) were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose for cabazitaxel in combination with
cisplatin 75mg/m2 and 5-FU 800mg/m2/d×4days is 22.5mg/m2 and for cisplatin
100mg/m2 and 5-FU 800mg/m2/d×4days is 17.5mg/m2. With a median follow-up of
39months, PFS for the entire non-metastatic population at 3years was
approximately 58%.
