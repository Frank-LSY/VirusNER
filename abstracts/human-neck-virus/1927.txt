BACKGROUND: Following chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) for human papilloma virus
positive (HPV+) locally advanced head and neck cancer, patients frequently
undergo unnecessary neck dissection (ND) and/or repeated biopsies for abnormal
PET-CT, which causes significant morbidity. We assessed the role of circulating
HPV DNA in identifying 'true' residual disease.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited test (n=55) and validation (n=33) cohorts.
HPV status was confirmed by E7 RT-PCR. We developed a novel amplicon-based next
generation sequencing assay (HPV16-detect) to detect circulating HPV DNA.
Circulating HPV DNA levels post-CCRT were correlated to disease response
(PET-CT).
RESULTS: In pre-CCRT plasma, HPV-detect demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 93%
specificity, and 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the test (27 HPV+) and 
validation (20 HPV+) cohorts, respectively. Thirty-six out of 37 patients (test
and validation cohort) with complete samples-set had negative HPV-detect at end
of treatment. Six patients underwent ND (3) and repeat primary site biopsies (3) 
for positive PET-CT but had no viable tumour. One patient had positive HPV-detect
and positive PET-CT and liver biopsy, indicating 100% agreement for HPV-detect
and residual cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that HPV16-detect is a highly sensitive and specific 
test for identification of HPV DNA in plasma at diagnosis. HPV DNA post-treatment
correlates with clinical response.
