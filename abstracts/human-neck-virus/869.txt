BACKGROUND: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a subtype of head-and-neck cancer with a
distinct clinical and prognostic profile. While there are calls to undertake HPV 
testing for oropharyngeal SCCs within the diagnostic setting and for clinical
trials, there are currently no internationally accepted standards.
METHODS: 142 tonsil SCCs were tested using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC),
high-risk HPV DNA in situ hybridisation (ISH) and HPV DNA polymerase chain
reaction (PCR; GP5+/6+ primers).
RESULTS: There were high levels of agreement between pathologists for p16 IHC and
HPV ISH scoring; however, around 10% of HPV ISH cases showed some interobserver
discrepancy that was resolved by slide review. The combination of p16 IHC and HPV
ISH classified 53% of the samples as HPV-positive, whereas the combination of p16
IHC and HPV PCR classified 61% of the samples as HPV-positive. By employing a
three-tiered, staged algorithm (p16 IHC/HPV ISH/HPV PCR), the authors were able
to classify 98% of the cases as either HPV-positive (p16 IHC+/HPV DNA+; 62%) or
HPV-negative (p16 IHC-/HPV DNA-; 35%).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that using a combination of p16 IHC/HPV
ISH/HPV PCR, in a three-tiered, staged algorithm, in conjunction with consensus
reporting of HPV ISH, leads to less equivocal molecular classification. In order 
to ensure consistent reporting of this emerging disease, it is increasingly
important for the head-and-neck oncology community to define the minimum
requirements for assigning a diagnosis of 'HPV-related' oropharyngeal SCC in
order to inform prognosis and for stratification in clinical trials.
