Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually secondary to alveolar rupture in the
pulmonary interstitium, associated with subcutaneous emphysema and occasionally
with pneumothorax, but is rarely associated with pneumorrhachis. The leaked air
into the pulmonary perivascular interstitium follows the path of least resistance
from the mediastinum to the fascial planes of the neck. Air freely communicates
via the neural foramina and collects in the epidural space. Pneumorrhachis is
defined as the presence of air in the spinal canal, either in the intradural
and/or extradural spaces. It is a very rare clinical entity and mostly
asymptomatic, hence most probably underdiagnosed. Many pathological and
physiological events can lead to alveolar rupture, and these clinical findings
can be related to various, mainly traumatic and iatrogenic etiologies. Herein we 
report three cases of pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, interstitial
emphysema and pneumorrhachis in two cases, which were related to rhinovirus,
human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection.
