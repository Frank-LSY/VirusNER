Epstein-Barr virus was detected in the oral exfoliated cells of 45.05% of OSCC patients and 18.08% of the non-cancer control (P < 0.001). Similarly, EBV was detected in 32.5% of the tumor lesions. Betel quid chewing was statistically significantly associated with EBV prevalence (OR = 2.08), whereas no association with tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing were significantly associated with OSCC (OR = 3.05 and OR = 5.05, respectively), but tobacco smoking was not associated. Interestingly, EBV was significantly associated with OSCC (OR = 3.76).
