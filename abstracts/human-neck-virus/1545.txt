OBJECTIVE: The current treatment for advanced head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma continues to result in poor outcomes. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the benefit of fibroblast growth factor 2-targeted
adenovirus-mediated mutant-Rad50 (FGF2-Ad-Rad50) gene transfer in enhancing
chemosensitization for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and reducing
chemotoxicity.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled laboratory study.
SETTING: University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor cells and
a mouse model with human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were used for this
study. There were five mice in each study group. FGF2-fab' molecule was
conjugated with an adenoviral mutant-Rad50 construct. FGF2-targeted transgene
expression efficiency was evaluated in vitro. Tumor cytotoxicity and growth
inhibition were examined after combined FGF2-Ad-Rad50 with cisplatin treatment in
vitro and in vivo. Anti-tumor mechanisms were investigated.
RESULTS: FGF2-targeted gene transfer approach significantly improved transgene
expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor cells over a
nontargeted approach (207.51+/-33.62 vs 51.44+/-8.28, respectively).
FGF2-Ad-Rad50 with cisplatin demonstrated a superior tumor suppression effect
(264.5+/-124.1 mm3 vs 567.1+/-267.6 mm3), increased DNA double-strand breaks
(1349+/-51.67 vs 774+/-28.56), and anti-angiogenesis (%ROI: 0.76%+/-0.38% vs
2.10%+/-1.66%) in tumor cells over nontargeted adenovirus.
CONCLUSION: Combination of FGF2-Ad-Rad50 with cisplatin significantly improves
anti-tumor effect by targeting DNA repair systems and tumor angiogenesis. The
great benefit of this strategy supports clinical trial for novel treatment of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
