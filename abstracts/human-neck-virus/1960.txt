A 29-year-old woman presented from another hospital with a 10-month history of an
enlarging left-sided facial mass. Computed tomographic scan revealed a mass in
the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland with left-sided cervical
lymphadenopathy. The patient received a total left parotidectomy and a selective 
neck dissection. Histopathologic slides revealed lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC)
that stained positive for cytokeratin, as well as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). An
LEC of the parotid is a rare salivary gland tumor accounting for less than 1% of 
all salivary gland tumors. As reaffirmed in our case, LEC is more common in
women, occurs primarily in the parotid gland, and has an ethnic predilection.
Histologic analysis reveals an infiltrative, poorly differentiated tumor nestled 
in a lymphoid stroma, with near 100% positivity for EBV in endemic areas.
Complete resection of this poorly differentiated carcinoma followed by
postoperative radiation is essential for local control.
