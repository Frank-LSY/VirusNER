Human papillomavirus has been identified as a causative factor for a subset of
head and neck carcinomas (HNSCC). The majority of the HPV-positive tumors arises 
in the oropharyngeal region, and at present, the infection of the human papilloma
type 16 is the major cause of the oropharyngeal cancer development. Patients with
HPV DNA-positive tumors have been shown to be younger in age and are less likely 
to have a history of tobacco smoking or alcohol use. The tumors referred to the
HPV positivity have been proven to more likely confer better prognosis. Seven
percent of the population between ages of 14 and 69 are infected by HPV at any
given time within the oral mucosa. However, only about 1Â % of those infections is
associated with the high-risk cancerogenous types of the virus. Up to date few
risk factors of HPV infection have been identified including age, gender and the 
sexual behavior. Tobacco smoking and immunosuppression have also been reported to
play a role in HPV infection.
