Forty-two fine-needle aspirate (FNA) specimens from 37 patients with cervical (n = 36) or mediastinal (n = 5) lymphadenopathy or a left parapharyngeal mass (n =1) were included in this prospective study. HR-HPV testing was performed on residual FNA material after direct smear preparation and, if positive, was further delineated into HPV 16/18 genotypes using the Roche cobas 4800 system. Follow-up included review of histologic material and/or electronic health records.
