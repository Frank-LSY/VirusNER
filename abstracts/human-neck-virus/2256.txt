AIM: To investigate whether the rise during the past decades in the incidence of 
tonsillar and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC and BOTSCC) and the
proportion of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cancer has continued in
Stockholm.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment biopsies (n=252) available from 280 patients 
diagnosed with TSCC and BOTSCC during 2008-2012 in the County of Stockholm were
tested for HPV DNA by a multiplex bead-based assay. Incidence records were
acquired from the Swedish Cancer Registry. The data obtained were evaluated
together with previous figures from 1970 to 2007.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was present in 186/252 (74%) of TSCC and BOTSCC biopsies
obtained during 2008-2012 in Stockholm. In this region the age-standardised
incidence, including the prevalence of HPV-positive and HPV-negative TSCC
stabilised 2007-2012 compared to 2000-2006, while for BOTSCC throughout 1998-2012
the same parameters increased moderately (p<0.05, for all). In parallel, from
2000 to 2006 through 2007-2012 in Sweden, the age-standardised incidence of both 
TSCC and BOTSCC continued to rise (p=0.012 and p=0.001 respectively).
CONCLUSION: During 2000-2012 the age-standardised incidence and the proportion of
HPV-positive TSCC have stabilised at a high level, while the proportion of
HPV-negative cancer has remained at a low level in Stockholm, whereas for BOTSCC 
all parameters are increasing moderately. In contrast, in Sweden the incidence of
both TSCC and BOTSCC is still increasing. We hypothesise that the HPV epidemic
could be stabilising, first for TSCC, but so far not for BOTSCC, in e.g. some
urban areas, while previous trends for both tumours persist at other geographic
locations.
