INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib is an oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is
currently the only evidence-based treatment recommended for advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of osteonecrosis of the jaw that
occurred during sorafenib therapy in a patient with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma not treated with bisphosphonates or other antiangiogenic drugs.
METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed yielded some cases of osteonecrosis of the
jaw in patients treated with antiangiogenic agents, alone or in combination with 
bisphosphonates, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The only case of
osteonecrosis observed during sorafenib therapy not combined with other
predisposing agents was described by Guillet et al.
RESULTS: A 74-year-old man diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma ensuing in
hepatitis C virus infection, who was treated with sorafenib at a daily dose of
400 mg, developed osteonecrosis of the right mandibular body. The lesion was
documented by a dental CT scan and surgical evaluation did not lead to an
indication for curettage treatment. Sorafenib was discontinued because of the
radiological and laboratory features of hepatocellular carcinoma progression and 
the high risk of jaw fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first description of osteonecrosis of 
the jaw detected in a cirrhotic patient on sorafenib therapy not combined with
bisphosphonates.
