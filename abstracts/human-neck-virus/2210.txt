BACKGROUND: Activation of the MET oncogene promotes tumor growth, invasion and
metastasis in several tumor types. Additionally, MET is activated as a
compensatory pathway in the presence of EGFR blockade, thus resulting in a
mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
METHODS: We have investigated the impact of HGF and MET expression, MET
activation (phosphorylation), MET gene status, and MET-activating mutations on
cetuximab sensitivity in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (HNSCC) patients.
RESULTS: A single-institution retrospective analysis was performed in 57
patients. MET overexpression was detected in 58% patients, MET amplification in
39% and MET activation (p-MET) in 30%. Amplification was associated with MET
overexpression. Log-rank testing showed significantly worse outcomes in
recurrent/metastatic, MET overexpressing patients for progression-free survival
and overall survival. Activation of MET was correlated with worse PFS and OS. In 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, p-MET was an independent prognostic
factor for PFS. HGF overexpression was observed in 58% patients and was
associated with MET phosphorylation, suggesting a paracrine activation of the
receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF/MET pathway activation correlated with worse outcome in
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC patients. When treated with a cetuximab-based regimen,
these patients correlated with worse outcome. This supports a dual blocking
strategy of HGF/MET and EGFR pathways for the treatment of patients with
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.
