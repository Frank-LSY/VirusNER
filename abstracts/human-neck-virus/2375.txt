Local delivery of therapeutic drugs into the inner ear is a promising therapy for
inner ear diseases. Injection through semicircular canals (canalostomy) has been 
shown to be a useful approach to local drug delivery into the inner ear. The goal
of this article is to describe, in detail, the surgical techniques involved in
canalostomy in both adult and neonatal mice. As indicated by fast-green dye and
adeno-associated virus serotype 8 with the green fluorescent protein gene, the
canalostomy facilitated broad distribution of injected reagents in the cochlea
and vestibular end-organs with minimal damage to hearing and vestibular function.
The surgery was successfully implemented in both adult and neonatal mice; indeed,
multiple surgeries could be performed if required. In conclusion, canalostomy is 
an effective and safe approach to drug delivery into the inner ears of adult and 
neonatal mice and may be used to treat human inner ear diseases in the future.
