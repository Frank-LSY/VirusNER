A 43-year-old man, admitted with a swollen right thigh, was diagnosed with a deep
vein thrombosis. On day 6 he became septic. A CT scan demonstrated a right-sided 
hydronephrosis and a large retroperitoneal collection. Blood cultures and
perinephric pus grew Escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin only. On day 12 a 
vesicular rash appeared on the neck and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) grew on
culture. On day 15 an upper leg collection was seen on CT scan. Thigh tissue
specimens grew extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E coli and HSV-1
was also detected by polymerase chain reaction in the tissue. On day 18 the
patient died. This case illustrates an unusual presentation and complication of a
perinephric abscess. In critically ill patients herpes simplex reactivation and
emergence of multiresistant organisms may occur resulting in treatment failure.
