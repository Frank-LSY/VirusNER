The rise in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) has elicited significant interest in the role of high-risk HPV 
in tumorigenesis. Because patients with HPV-positive HNSCC have better prognoses 
than do their HPV-negative counterparts, current therapeutic strategies for HPV‚Å∫ 
HNSCC are increasingly considered to be overly aggressive, highlighting a need
for customized treatment guidelines for this cohort. Additional issues include
the unmet need for a reliable screening strategy for HNSCC, as well as the
ongoing assessment of the efficacy of prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of
HPV infections in the head and neck regions. This review also outlines a number
of emerging prospects for therapeutic vaccines, as well as for targeted,
molecular-based therapies for HPV-associated head and neck cancers. Overall, the 
future for developing novel and effective therapeutic agents for HPV-associated
head and neck tumors is promising; continued progress is critical in order to
meet the challenges posed by the growing epidemic.
