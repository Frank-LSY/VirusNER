BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers are the commonest cancer in Southeast Asia.
Despite being a surface cancer, it is associated with significant morbidity as
despite early detection by the patients they often report for treatment late and 
hence are associated with poor prognosis. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
head and neck cancer is still under evaluation; there is a large subgroup of
population that does not respond to chemotherapy, and hence, most studies have
failed to show any survival benefit. This study evaluated the role of neoadjuvant
therapy with docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with oral cancer and
correlated the response to human papilloma virus, EGFR1, EGFR2, and GADD45
expression.
METHODS: A total of 24 locally advanced, non-metastatic oral cancer patients were
included in the study. Tumor biopsies were taken prior to the start of
neoadjuvant therapy for expression of EGFR, Her-2-Neu, and GADD45 by
immunohistochemistry and for HPV by PCR. The response was evaluated using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria after three cycles
of chemotherapy. Statistical analysis was performed using correlation and
Kaplan-Meier analysis; the difference in survival was calculated with log rank
test.
RESULTS: A total of 21 male and 3 female with a mean age of 53.12 years were
enrolled. Sixty-five percent of these received three cycles of chemotherapy. Five
patients were positive for HPV 16 and none for HPV 18. Twenty-two of 24 patients 
showed GADD45 expression, 3 showed expression of Her-2-Neu while all 24 showed
expression for EGFR1 protein. Two-year overall survival was 81%; GADD45
expressions were found to significantly affect the overall and disease-free
survival, while any of the other protein expression studied and HPV status was
not significant.
CONCLUSION: The result of the present study shows significant downgrading of the 
oral cancers with neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggesting its utility in borderline
operable cases. However, the response of chemotherapy does not appear to be
related to the expression of EGFR, Her-2-Neu, and GADD45 protein or presence of
HPV. Bone involvement, perineural invasion, and GADD45 expression significantly
predict OS and DFS. All patients who did not express Gadd45 died before 2 years. 
Study with more subjects and longer follow-up should be carried out to elucidate 
this relation further.
