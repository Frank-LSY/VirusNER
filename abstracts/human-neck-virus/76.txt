We explored the necessity of human papillomavirus (HPV) status-specific biomarkers in patients with head and neck cancer and identified an HPV status-specific gene set. The identified gene set was validated with the external microarray datasets. For this purpose, we used 4 microarray datasets obtained from a public database. One dataset was used for identifying the HPV status specific gene set, and the other datasets were used for validation.
