Despite declining smoking rates in the United States, the incidence of oral
squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC, including oral cavity and oropharynx) is rising
in young adults. The reasons have been attributed to changes in sexual behaviors 
and the increasingly prevalent infection of oncogenic subtypes of human
papillomavirus (HPV), principally type16 and occasionally type18. However, only
small proportion of individuals who have contracted HPV infection will develop
OSCC, suggesting that there is an inter-individual variation in susceptibility to
HPV infection and related OSCC. Identification of susceptible biomarkers for HPV 
status would be useful to identify those individuals who are susceptible to HPV
infection, to refine the prognostication of HPV associated OSCC, and ultimately
to improve prevention efforts for OSCC and potentially other HPV-associated
diseases. Our public health OSCC prevention paradigm will need to expand beyond
tobacco and alcohol control.
