BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a CMCSCC-1 cell line for
head and neck cancer research into new therapies for head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: The CMCSCC-1 cell line was isolated from a primary oral tongue tumor
specimen of a female patient. Tumor cells were evaluated for biomarkers
expression by Western blots, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), fluorescence activated cell sorter, and immunostaining. Cell
proliferation in response to radiation was measured by the WST-8 assay.
RESULTS: The characterization analyses revealed a typical epithelial morphology; 
a doubling time of approximately 24 hours, high tumorigenicity in immunodeficient
mice, and upregulated biomarkers. CMCSCC-1 cells were negative for human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection, but more sensitive to radiation compared with
those FaDu cell lines.
CONCLUSION: CMCSCC-1, a novel oral tongue SCC cell line, was established. It will
help in the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of HPV-negative
radiosensitive tumors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E542-E551,
