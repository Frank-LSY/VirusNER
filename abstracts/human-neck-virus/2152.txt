The presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA transcripts in a 
subset of sinonasal carcinomas is evidence of involvement of HPV in its
etiopathogenesis.

The aim of the study was to investigate prevalence of high-risk human
papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in sinonasal carcinomas by
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction,
detecting p16(INK4a) protein (p16) expression and presence of both HPV DNA and
HPV E6/E7 messenger RNA (mRNA). The study comprised 47 males and 26 females, aged
23-83 years (median 62 years), mostly (67 %) with a squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC). Of the tumors, 53 % arose in the nasal cavity, 42 % in the maxillary
sinus, and 5 % in the ethmoid complex. The follow-up period ranged 1-241 months
(median 19 months). HPV16, HPV18, or HPV35 were detected in 18/73 (25 %) tumors, 
17 SCCs, and 1 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. There was a strong
correlation between results of HPV detection methods and p16 expression
(p < 0.005). HPV-positive SCCs occurred more frequently in smokers (p = 0.04) and
were more frequently p16-positive (p < 0.0001) and nonkeratinizing (p = 0.02),
the latter occurring more commonly in nasal cavity (p = 0.025). Median survival
for HPV-positive SCC patients was 30 months, while for HPV-negative SCC patients 
was 14 months (p = 0.23). In summary, we confirm that HR-HPV is actively involved
in the etiopathogenesis of a significant subset of sinonasal SCCs. p16 may be
used as a reliable surrogate marker for determination of HPV status also in
sinonasal SCCs. Although we observed a trend toward better overall survival in
HPV-positive SCCs, the prognostic impact of HPV status in sinonasal carcinomas
needs to be elucidated by further studies.
