Interferon-α (IFN-α) and IFN-λ are structurally distinct cytokines that bind to
different receptors, but induce expression of similar sets of genes through Janus
kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways. 
The difference between IFN-α and IFN-λ signaling remains poorly understood. Here,
using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we examine the role of STAT1 and STAT2 in the
inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by IFN-α and IFN-λ. Treatment
with IFN-α increases expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as
double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and decreases viral RNA and
protein levels in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells. These responses are 
only partially attenuated by knockout of STAT1 but are abolished by knockout of
STAT2. In contrast, the inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-λ is abolished by
knockout of STAT1 or STAT2. Microarray analysis reveals that IFN-α but not IFN-λ 
can induce expression of the majority of ISGs in STAT1 knockout cells. These
findings suggest that IFN-α can inhibit HCV replication through a STAT2-dependent
but STAT1-independent pathway, whereas IFN-λ induces ISG expression and inhibits 
HCV replication exclusively through a STAT1- and STAT2-dependent pathway.
