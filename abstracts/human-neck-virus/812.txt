To evaluate the prevalence and meaning of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV)
types in HNSCC 51 patients were analyzed for the prevalence of cutaneous as well 
as mucosal HPV. HPV DNA was demonstrated in 18 (35%) of 51 tumors. The majority
of these HPV types belong to so-called cutaneous HPV types, whereas only HPV 6
and HPV 16 were from the mucosal HPV types. A possible role for cutaneous HPV
types as co-factors in the oncogenesis of HNSCC remains to be elucidated and may 
be relevant for future strategies of cancer prevention.
