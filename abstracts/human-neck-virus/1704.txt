PURPOSE: We investigated the prognostic factors for distant metastasis (DM) in
patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated with surgery
and adjuvant radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients treated between January 1995 and
August 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. Data regarding the pathological
tumour and nodal status, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, treatment
characteristics, and pretreatment maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of
18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan
(18F-FDG PET-CT) were evaluated, and their influence on DM and survival outcomes 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: Median follow-up period was 48.0 months. Recurrence was observed in 20
patients, including locoregional recurrence and DM. DM was observed in 13
patients. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the presence of lymphovascular
invasion (p=0.031), lower neck lymph node (LN) involvement (p=0.006), SUVmax ≥
9.7 (p=0.014), and tumour size ≥ 3 cm (p=0.037) significantly affected DM. HPV
status was not associated with DM. Perineural invasion (p=0.048), lower neck
LNinvolvement (p=0.008), SUVmax ≥ 9.7 (p=0.019), and tumour size ≥ 3 cm (p=0.033)
were also significant factors for the DM-free survival rate.
CONCLUSION: Lower neck LN involvement, high SUVmax in pretreatment 18F-FDG
PET-CT, and large tumour size were predictive factors for DM in patients of OPC.
