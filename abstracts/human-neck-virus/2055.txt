OBJECTIVE: Lymphoma is considered to be a kind of malignant tumour. Gene therapy 
and radiotherapy have been reported as treatment methods for head and neck
lymphoma. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety for the treatment
of head and neck lymphoma by a combination of recombinant adenovirus p53
(rAd-p53) and radiotherapy.
METHODS: A total of 156 patients with head and neck lymphoma were selected. All
patients received an intratumor injection of rAd-p53 of four different doses,
namely, 0, 1 × 1010 VP, 1 × 1011 VP and 1 × 1012 VP, once a week for 8 weeks, and
radiotherapy was administered 3 days after the rAd-p53 injection using the same
dosage and method. Four, eight and twelve weeks after treatment, tumor reduction 
and complete response (CR) rates, special laboratory examination and adverse
reaction assessment were detected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined
treatment with rAd-p53 injection and radiotherapy for head and neck lymphoma.
RESULTS: At week 4, 8 and 12 of treatment with rAd-p53 at the 1 × 1010 VP, 1 ×
1011 VP and 1 × 1012 VP doses, the average tumour reduction and CR rates were
evidently elevated, the anti rAd-p53 antibody in the serum of patients was
expressed positively, and the T cell subsets (CD3/CD4/CD8) increased and
interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) level decreased markedly. Additionally, rAd-p53
was proven to be clinically safe in the treatment.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, we conclude that rAd-p53 combined with radiotherapy
improves the efficacy and safety in treating head and neck lymphoma, which has a 
broad scope in future clinical application.
