Current Trends in the Incidence and Presentation of Oropharyngeal Cancer.

Younai FS.

The prevalence and behavior of oropharyngeal cancers have dramatically changed
over the past 30 years. It is now clear that human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a
major role in the incidence of head and neck cancers in the general population
and among patients with HIV infection. This article reviews the current knowledge
about oropharyngeal cancers for their epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical
behavior, treatment and prevention. This review further examines the subset of
oropharyngeal cancers among the HIV-seropositive patients.
