Recent studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with a certain subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-namely, those arising in the oropharynx. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, detection, and genotype of high-risk (HR) HPV using the Roche cobas 4800 system (Roche Molecular System, Pleasanton, CA).
