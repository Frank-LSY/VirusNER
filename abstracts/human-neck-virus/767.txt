It has been estimated that more than 50 million cases of dengue occur worldwide
each year, mostly in the tropics. In light of recent cases appearing in central
and southern Florida, dengue has reemerged as a public health issue in the United
States with respect to infection control and prevention. We review the course of 
dengue infection and its clinical presentation from the perspective of the
practicing otolaryngologist, and we outline tactics for prevention and
management.
