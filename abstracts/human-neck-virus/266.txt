The International Conference on Innovative Approaches in Head and Neck Oncology
is a biennial joint meeting under the auspices of the European Society for
Radiotherapy and Oncology, the European Head and Neck Society and the European
Society of Medical Oncology. The conference focuses on recent developments in
head and neck oncology. The main topics of this year were new insights in the
epidemiology of head and neck cancer, the emerging role of human papillomavirus
in head and neck cancer, update on randomized trials and new management
approaches. The format of the meeting included invited key note lectures,
interactive symposia, updates on large randomized trials, proffered paper
sessions, poster presentations and tumor boards. The meeting was very well
balanced, with abundant information and opportunities for interdisciplinary
interaction.
