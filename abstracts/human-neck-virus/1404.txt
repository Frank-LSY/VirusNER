Human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) 
remains increasing worldwide. We aimed to investigate if the HPV-prevalence of
OPSCC in the Netherlands is rising as well, also in female patients. In addition,
we evaluated the association between HPV-positive OPSCC and suspicious Pap
results of the cervix in these female patients. Patients with OPSCC treated in
the period 2000-2015 at the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, were included
(n = 926). The presence of an oncogenic HPV infection was determined by
p16-immunostaining, followed by a high-risk HPV general primer 5+/6+ DNA PCR on
the p16-immunopositive cases. A review of pathology reports in all female
patients (n = 305) was undertaken to identify cytological signs of HPV-related
(pre)cancer of the cervix. In total 281 of 926 (30.3%) OPSCCs were HPV-positive. 
Moreover, a significant increase in the prevalence of HPV-positive OPSCCs was
observed from 14.0% in 2000 to 48.1% in 2015 (p < 0.001). Among the female
patients with an HPV-positive OPSSC (n = 70), the results of cervical smears were
available in 56 of 70 patients (80.0%). Of the female patients with HPV-positive 
OPSCC, 9 of 56 (16.1%) patients had a vaginal cuff Papanicolaou (Pap) test ≥3b in
their medical history compared to 7 of 168 (4.2%) in the HPV-negative group
(p = 0.003). In conclusion, a continuous increase in the HPV-attributable
fraction of OPSCC was demonstrated in the period 2000-2015 in the Amsterdam
region. HPV-positive OPSCC has a significant association with a history of
suspicious Pap results of the cervix in female patients.
