BACKGROUND: The management of patients with advanced stages of head and neck
cancer requires a multidisciplinary and multimodality treatment approach which
includes a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. These toxic
treatment protocols have significantly improved survival outcomes in a distinct
population of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancer. HPV
negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a challenge to
treat because there is only a modest improvement in survival with the present
treatment regimens, requiring innovative and new treatment approaches. Oncolytic 
viruses used as low toxicity adjunct cancer therapies are novel, potentially
effective treatments for HNSCC. One such oncolytic virus is Respiratory Orphan
Enteric virus or reovirus. Susceptibility of HNSCC cells towards reovirus
infection and reovirus-induced cell death has been previously demonstrated but
has not been compared in HPV positive and negative HNSCC cell lines.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the infectivity and oncolytic activity of reovirus in HPV 
positive and negative HNSCC cell lines.
METHODS: Seven HNSCC cell lines were infected with serial dilutions of reovirus. 
Two cell lines (UM-SCC-47 and UM-SCC-104) were positive for type 16 HPV.
Infectivity was measured using a cell-based ELISA assay 18 h after infection.
Oncolytic activity was determined using an alamar blue viability assay 96 h after
infection. Non-linear regression models were used to calculate the amounts of
virus required to infect and to cause cell death in 50% of a given cell line
(EC50). EC50 values were compared.
RESULTS: HPV negative cells were more susceptible to viral infection and
oncolysis compared to HPV positive cell lines. EC50 for infectivity at 18 h
ranged from multiplicity of infection (MOI) values (PFU/cell) of 18.6 (SCC-9) to 
3133 (UM-SCC 104). EC50 for cell death at 96 h ranged from a MOI (PFU/cell) of
1.02×10(2) (UM-SCC-14A) to 3.19×10(8) (UM-SCC-47). There was a 3×10(6) fold
difference between the least susceptible cell line (UM-SCC-47) and the most
susceptible line (UM-SCC 14A) EC50 for cell death at 96 h.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV negative HNSCC cell lines appear to demonstrate greater reovirus
infectivity and virus-mediated oncolysis compared to HPV positive HNSCC. Reovirus
shows promise as a novel therapy in HNSCC, and may be of particular benefit in
HPV negative patients.
