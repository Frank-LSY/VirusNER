Acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EDV) is a rare condition occurring in
patients with depressed cellular immunity, particularly individuals with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Acquired EDV is less commonly reported in
recipients of stem cell or solid organ transplantation. This condition typically 
manifests within 5 years of initial immunosuppression and can present as multiple
hypopigmented to red, tinea versicolor-like macules or as multiple verrucous,
flat-topped papules distributed over the trunk, arms, and legs. Human
papillomavirus (HPV) types 5 and 8 are the most commonly isolated EDV-HPV
subtypes as well as the most oncogenic subtypes, carrying the greatest risk for
malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We present the case 
of a 44-year-old renal transplant recipient who developed multiple hypopigmented 
papules on the chest and neck with histopathology showing characteristic changes 
of EDV.
