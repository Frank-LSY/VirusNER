Approximately 90 % of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC),
and the overall 5-year survival rate is not higher than 50 %. There is much
evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may influence the expression
of commonly studied HNSCC markers. Our study was focused on the possible
HPV-specificity of molecular markers that could be key players in important steps
of cancerogenesis (MKI67, EGF, EGFR, BCL-2, BAX, FOS, JUN, TP53, MT1A, MT2A,
VEGFA, FLT1, MMP2, MMP9, and POU5F). qRT-PCR analysis of these selected genes was
performed on 74 biopsy samples of tumors from patients with histologically
verified HNSCC (22 HPV-, 52 HPV+). Kaplan-Meier analysis was done to determine
the relevance of these selected markers for HNSCC prognosis. In conclusion, our
study confirms the impact of HPV infection on commonly studied HNSCC markers
MT2A, MMP9, FLT1, VEGFA, and POU5F that were more highly expressed in
HPV-negative HNSCC patients and also shows the relevance of studied markers in
HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC patients.
