human papilloma virus (HPV) is a major risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and knowledge of a patient's HPV status is clinically important in terms of treatment and prognosis. The practicality of using oral gargle samples to reliably detect HPV in patients with OPSCC remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of HPV detection in gargle samples of OPSCC patients using an HPV-dedicated nucleic acid amplification test (cobas 4800 HPV Test; Roche Diagnostics K.K.).
