OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize deep neck infections (DNI) in adult
intravenous drug users (IDUs) who injected illicit substances to their neck, in
comparison to DNI in non-IDUs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical charts of adult DNI patients in a
secondary hospital during 2000-2013. Clinical, radiologic, and microbial data
were extracted and tabulated following categorization into 2 patient groups: IDUs
and non-IDUs.
RESULTS: Of the 136 patients identified with DNI, 20 (15%) were IDUs; of them 80%
were males. IDUs were significantly younger than non-IDUs (mean age, 35 ± 10 vs. 
44 ± 16 years, P = .01). All IDUs had multiple comorbidities. IDUs presented for 
medical examination and hospitalization later in the course of their disease, and
the most common involved neck spaces were consistent with areas where cervical
injections are commonly performed. Abscess formation was more common in IDUs than
non-IDUs (16 [80%] vs. 79 [68%], respectively, P = .04). Despite later
presentation of IDUs and their higher rate of comorbidities, laboratory data,
microbiology cultures, and disease course were similar to non-IDUs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although IDU and non-IDU differ in DNI presentation, both groups had
good outcomes. DNI in IDUs frequently evolved into abscesses, and most were found
in the anterior triangle deep to sternocleidomastoid (SCM), posterior triangle,
and anterior triangle superficial to SCM, in concordance with the injection
sites.
