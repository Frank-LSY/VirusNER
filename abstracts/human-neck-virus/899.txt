HPV-positive head and neck tumours, a distinct clinical entity.

Nevens D, Nuyts S.

A worldwide rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer has been 
recorded over the past decade. This rise has been attributed to an increase in
oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) infections. The biology of HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancer is distinct; it includes p53 degradation, retinoblastoma
pathway inactivation, and p16 upregulation. The best method for detecting HPV in 
tumour material is controversial; both in-situ hybridisation and PCR are commonly
used. However, p16 can serve as a potential surrogate marker, and therefore, p16 
immunohistochemistry is widely used in clinical practice. Compared to
HPV-negative cancers, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer appears to be more
responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, p16 can serve as a prognostic 
marker for enhanced overall survival and disease-free survival. In this review,
we aimed to highlight the current understanding of the epidemiology, biology,
detection, and management of HPV-related oropharyngeal head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma.
