Cowpox viruses are orthopoxviruses that may survive in the environment for years.
Rodents are regarded as the primary hosts, but transmission to other species has 
been reported. This report describes a cowpox virus infection in a cat with
subsequent transmission to its owner leading to protracted, atypical and severe
clinical signs. A young cat presented with multiple crusts and plaques on the
neck, muzzle and tail base. The owner developed an erythematous lesion with
elevated margins, central necrosis and crust formation below the left breast, a
neurogenic inflammation, enlarged regional lymph nodes, a colliquative
lymphadenitis and concomitant flu-like symptoms. Cultures were taken at the first
visit from the cat's lesional skin and the patient's skin, and polymerase chain
reaction with sequencing of the haemagglutinin region of both were positive for
cowpox virus. The patient was treated with various antibiotics and
methylprednisolone and was in clinical remission after 7 months.
