rVTT-TA35-TJ, an attenuated vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (VTT), was constructed
by knocking out two non-essential gene fragments (TA35R and TJ2R) related to
virulence, immunomodulation, and host range; and by combining double marker
screening with exogenous and endogenous selectable marker knock-out techniques.
Here, the shuttle plasmids pSK-TA35 and pSK-TJ were constructed, containing two
pairs of recombinant arms: early and late strong promoter pE/L and EGFP as an
exogenous selectable marker. The recombinant vaccinia virus rVTT-TA35-TJ without 
exogenous selection markers was then obtained through homologous recombination
technology and the Cre/loxP system. Knocking out the two gene fragments does not 
affect the replication ability of the virus and displays a good genetic
stability. Furthermore, a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate 
that although virulence of rVTT-TA35-TJ is attenuated significantly, high
immunogenicity was maintained. These results support the potential development of
rVTT-TA35-TJ as a safe viral vector or vaccine.
