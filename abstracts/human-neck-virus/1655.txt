BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
status and to establish the histologic correlates in oropharyngeal cancer
(OPSCC).
METHOD: The medical records of 78 patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for
OPSCC before surgery were reviewed.
RESULTS: The positive rate of high-risk HPV in situ hybridization was 36% (28 of 
78). The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax ) of negativity for the
high-risk HPV subtypes (10.29 ± 4.30) and positivity (6.69 ± 4.17) were found to 
be significantly different (p = .001). The SUVmax cutoff value for
differentiating negativity for the high-risk HPV subtypes from positivity was
7.10, with the sensitivity of 78% and the specificity of 68%. A median SUVmax
(using 7.10 as a cutoff) (p = .041) and high-risk HPV status (p = .040) were
found to be associated with 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS).
CONCLUSIONS: Median (18)F-FDG PET/CT SUVmax cutoff values 7.10 or greater are
associated with a high-risk HPV negativity in OPSCC patients.
