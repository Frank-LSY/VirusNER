Reduced engraftment by HPV + tumors lacking PNI likely results in selection biases in HNSCC PDX models. Formation of EBV + lymphomas in NSG mice further reduces the generation of HPV + models and must be ruled out before long-term use of PDXs. Nevertheless, the retention of distinctive pathologic traits and viral oncogene expression by HPV + PDXs provides a viable in vivo platform for basic and translational studies as well as a resource for generating advanced in vitro models.
