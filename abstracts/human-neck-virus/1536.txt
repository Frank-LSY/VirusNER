AIM OF THE STUDY: The induced expression of the transcription factors neurogenin1
(Neurog1) or neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) has previously been shown to
initiate neuronal differentiation in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Human bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are ethically non-controversial
stem cells. However, they are not pluripotent. In cochlear implantation,
regeneration or replacement of lost spiral ganglion neurons may be a measure for 
the improvement of implant function. Thus, the aim of the study was to
investigate whether the expression of Neurog1 or NeuroD1 is sufficient for
induction of neuronal differentiation in hBMSCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human BMSCs were transduced with lentivirus expressing
NeuroD1 or Neuorg1. Transduced cells were then treated with small molecules that 
enhanced neuronal differentiation. Markers of neuronal differentiation were
evaluated.
RESULTS: Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR, the up-regulation of
transcription factors expressed by developing primary auditory neurons, such as
BRN3a (POU4F1) and GATA3, was quantified after induction of Neurog-1 expression. 
In addition, the expression of the receptor NTRK2 was induced by treatment with
its specific ligand BDNF. The induction of expression of the vesicular glutamate 
transporter 1 was identified on gene and protein level. NeuroD1 seemed not
sufficient to induce and maintain neuronal differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Induction of neuronal differentiation by overexpression of Neurog1
initiated important steps for the development of glutamatergic neurons such as
the spiral ganglion neurons. However, it seems not sufficient to maintain the
glutamatergic spiral ganglion neuron-like phenotype.
