OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to investigate the relevance of
immunohistochemical p53 expression in carcinomas of the oral cavity and of the
head and neck region. Long-term clinical and histopathological follow-up findings
as well as HPV status are correlated with the results of this examination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections made from two tissue arrays composed of 222 oral 
squamous cell carcinomas and 427 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck
region, respectively, were examined for p53 expression and Ki-67 index by means
of immunohistochemistry. Correlation of long-term clinical findings of the
patients and pathological features of tumours with laboratory results were
examined statistically.
RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between the p53 immunohistochemical
expression in the 207 oral carcinomas and features of the tumours and patient
outcomes. There was no significant association between the Ki-67 labelling index 
and the p53 expression.
DISCUSSION: Our failure in detecting any association of the p53
immunohistochemical expression regardless of HPV status with clinical features of
these tumours suggests it lacks a prognostic value for squamous cell carcinomas
of the oral cavity.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prognostic value of p53 immunostaining in oral squamous
carcinoma is not clarified yet. In the present study, there is no impact on any
prognostical item nor even a correlation with cell proliferation (Ki-67)
regardless of HPV status.
