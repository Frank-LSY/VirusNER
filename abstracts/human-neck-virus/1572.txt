Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is now
recognised as a subtype of head and neck cancer with distinct clinical, molecular
and histological characteristics. The majority of these carcinomas are of
non-keratinising squamous type but there is a growing number of histomorphologic 
variants of this disease. Here we describe the clinical, histomorphologic and
immunophenotypic features of two cases of human papillomavirus-associated
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma demonstrating a clearly delineated biphasic
differentiated and undifferentiated phenotype.
