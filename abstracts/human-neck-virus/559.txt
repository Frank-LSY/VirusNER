PURPOSE: HPV-related locally advanced head and neck cancers (LA-HNCs) show a good
prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the HPV prevalence in LA-HNCs and
compare the prognostic value of E1, E6 and L1 genomic viral fragments and p16,
individually and in combination, in order to find the best prognosticator in
terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HPV16 was searched in 255 LA-HNC formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor tissues, 89 oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs), and 166
non-OPCs by DNA-PCR with 3 primer pairs. p16 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry
in 235 patients.
RESULTS: The prevalence of positive samples decreased constantly from E6 to L1
and E1 in both OPCs and non-OPCs. Each LA-HNC patient highlighted variable
positivity for each fragment. OPCs showed a higher prevalence of positive samples
compared to non-OPCs.Positive coexistence of all the fragments was more common in
OPCs (31.5%) than non-OPCs (4.2%), and E1 detection was always associated with E6
and L1. E1-positive OPCs showed improved OS (p = 0.012) and PFS (p = 0.036),
while L1- or E6-positive ones did not. p16-positive patients were more prevalent 
in the OPC (29.8%) than the non-OPC group (7.3%) (p&lt;0.0001) and its prognostic
value was not superior to that of E1. However, the multivariate Cox analysis
which included E1, L1, E6 status and p16 expression did not show a significant p 
value.
CONCLUSIONS: Though HPV16 positivity measured by DNA-PCR was higher for L1 and
E6, they performed weakly as prognosticators; E1 might become a strong prognostic
marker for OS and PFS in OPCs.
