Cancers of the head and neck that arise from habitual exposure to carcinogens
have lower cure rates than those that arise from infection with human
papillomavirus (HPV), and intensification of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation
has not improved outcomes. HPV-negative head and neck cancers abundantly express 
EGFR, and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, directed against EGFR, is the only
targeted therapy that has improved disease survival so far. However, response
rates to single-agent cetuximab are lower than 15%, and cetuximab given with
chemotherapy or radiation leads to only a modest effect on survival. Thus,
investigating the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibition in HPV-negative
head and neck cancer might help identify novel and active therapies. In this
Review, we focus on therapies in development that target redundant receptor
tyrosine kinases (eg, HER2 and MET), reduce or abrogate nuclear functions of
EGFR, affect cellular trafficking by inhibition of histone deacetylase, or
treatments that might address resistance that arises in the EGFR signalling
stream (eg, aurora-kinase inhibitors and STAT decoys).
