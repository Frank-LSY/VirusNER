A 43-year-old lady with type 2 diabetes mellitus and bronchial asthma presented
with varicella zoster infection, dyspnea, and neck fullness. An urgent computed
tomography scan revealed a mediastinal abscess with superior vena cava thrombus. 
Blood, mediastinal pus, and swab from a vesiculopustule on the neck cultured
group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus. She recovered with a combination of broad
spectrum antimicrobials, antivirals, and surgical drainage. This case illustrates
the rare occurrence of mediastinal abscess and acute superior vena cava
obstruction caused by group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus complicating adult
varicella zoster.
