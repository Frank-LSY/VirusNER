OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of archived and
fresh fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens from metastatic head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for the molecular detection and genotyping of
high-risk (HR) HPV.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-seven specimens from 26 patients diagnosed by FNA with
metastatic SCC were included as retrospective specimens [19 slides stained with
Papanicolaou (Pap) and 18 with Diff-Quik® (DQ)]. Twenty fresh FNA specimens from 
18 patients were included as prospective specimens. These specimens were analyzed
using the standard protocol for ThinPrep® cervical specimens, with a Cervista HR 
HPV detection kit. The positive specimens were tested for the HPV 16 and 18
genotypes.
RESULTS: Forty-four of 57 specimens (77%) had sufficient cells to yield a valid
HPV result. The adequacy rate for Pap-stained slides was 15/19 (79%), for
DQ-stained slides it was 13/18 (72%), and for fresh needle aspirates it was 16/20
(80%). HR HPV was detected in 23/44 (52%) specimens. Among the 23 HPV-positive
specimens, 19 were genotyped as HPV 16 and 1 as HPV 18.
CONCLUSIONS: HR HPV detection and genotyping can be performed on FNA specimens of
head and neck SCC prospectively collected in PreservCyt as well as on archival
slides with either Pap or DQ stain.
