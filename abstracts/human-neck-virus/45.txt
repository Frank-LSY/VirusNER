There is considerable debate within the literature about the significance of
human papilloma virus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and its potential
influence on the prevention, diagnosis, grading, treatment and prognosis of these
cancers. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption have traditionally been cited 
as the main risk factors for head and neck cancers. However, human papilloma
virus, normally associated with cervical and other genital carcinomas, has
emerged as a possible key aetiological factor in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, especially oropharyngeal cancers. These cancers pose a significant
financial burden on health resources and are increasing in incidence. The recent 
introduction of vaccines targeted against human papilloma virus types 16 and 18, 
to prevent cervical cancer, has highlighted the need for ongoing research into
the importance of human papilloma virus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
