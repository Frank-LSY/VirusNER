Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a recently identified causative agent for a subset 
of head and neck cancers, primarily in the oropharynx, and is largely responsible
for the rising worldwide incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). Patients with
HPV-positive OPC have distinct risk factor profiles and generally have a better
prognosis than patients with traditional, HPV-negative, head and neck cancer.
Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is a widely accepted primary treatment
modality for many patients with HPV-positive OPC. However, recent advances in
surgical modalities, including transoral laser and robotic surgery, have led to
the reemergence of primary surgical treatment for HPV-positive patients. Clinical
trials are under way to determine optimal treatment strategies for the growing
subset of patients with HPV-positive OPC. Similarly, identifying those patients
with HPV-positive cancer who are at risk for recurrence and poor survival is
critical in order to tailor individual treatment regimens and avoid potential
undertreatment.
