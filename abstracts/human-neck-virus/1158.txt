BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in sinonasal squamous cell
carcinoma (SNSCC) is not well understood.
METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for cases of SNSCC with known
HPV status. Demographics, socioeconomic variables, TNM stage, histology, grade,
treatment modalities, and overall survival (OS) through 5 years were compared
between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. Cox proportional hazard regression 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy (770) cases were identified; 526 were HPV-negative
(68.3%) and 244 (31.7%) were HPV-positive. Patients with HPV-positive tumors were
younger (58.0 vs 63.7 years, p < 0.0001). Nasal cavity (49.4%) tumors were more
likely to be HPV-positive (p < 0.05) than maxillary (18.8%), ethmoid (18.8%), and
frontal (18.2%) sinus tumors. Large cell nonkeratinizing (42.4%), papillary
(42.1%), and basaloid (56.5%) tumors were more likely than keratinizing (25.2%)
tumors to be HPV-positive (p < 0.05). Well-differentiated (grade I) tumors (9.0%)
were less likely than higher grade tumors to be HPV-positive (p < 0.05). Gender, 
race, facility type, insurance type, median income, education level,
Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, overall stage, T stage, N stage, M stage, tumor 
size, treatment modality, surgical approach, and surgical margins did not vary by
HPV status (p ≥ 0.05). HPV-positive tumors had higher OS than HPV-negative tumors
(p < 0.0001). At 5 years, OS was 68.1% and 51.5% for HPV-positive and
HPV-negative tumors, respectively. On multivariate analyses, HPV positivity
remained a favorable prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence
interval, 0.34-0.70).
CONCLUSION: HPV positivity is more common in nasal cavity SCC and nonkeratinizing
SNSCC. It is also a favorable prognostic factor in SNSCC. Future studies on SNSCC
should take HPV positivity into consideration.
