BACKGROUND: Pulmonary colonization with antibiotic-resistant organisms in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is often preceded by upper-airway infections. 
Although there is a well-described relationship between pulmonary respiratory
viral infections and overall disease progression of CF, the pathogenicity of
respiratory viral infections in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF remains
unknown. With recent advances in respiratory virus detection techniques, this
study sought to detect the presence of respiratory viruses in the paranasal
sinuses of patients with CF in comparison with healthy controls and to correlate 
the viral presence with clinical measures of sinonasal disease.
METHODS: This prospective individual cohort study compared 24 patients with CF
with 14 healthy controls. Basic demographics, clinical measures of disease and
respiratory viral screens (commercial multiplex) obtained directly from the
paranasal sinuses were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 33% of patients with CF (8/24)
compared with 0% of the healthy controls (0/14) (p = 0.017). Respiratory viruses 
were only detected during the winter months, and the most commonly identified
were influenza A and human rhinovirus strains. There was no statistical
difference in the 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores (p = 0.93) or 
modified Lund-Kennedy scores (p = 0.74) between patients with CF with a positive 
viral test and those without a positive result.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral detection is more commonly detected in the
paranasal sinuses of patients with CF compared with healthy controls. Although
respiratory viral presence did not correlate with a worse clinical severity of
sinonasal disease, these findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of
CF and open new avenues for potential targeted therapy.
