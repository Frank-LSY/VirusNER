BACKGROUND: Circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA is a predictor of disease
recurrence in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Circulating human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in the sera of some patients with
HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPC). The goal of the
current study was to determine whether pretreatment serum HPV DNA is a useful
biomarker for disease recurrence in patients with HPV-positive OPC.
METHODS: The study included patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated
OPC. Tumor HPV status was determined by polymerase chain reaction; serum HPV DNA 
was detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differences in clinical
characteristics between patients who were positive and negative for pretreatment 
serum HPV DNA were described using standard descriptive statistical methods.
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to detect
statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were included. Patients with high N category and
those with TNM stage IV disease were found to have higher rates of detectable
pretreatment serum HPV DNA. Patients with HPV-positive tumors had better PFS than
patients with HPV-negative tumors. Among patients with HPV-positive tumors, those
who were negative for pretreatment serum HPV DNA had better PFS than those who
were positive for pretreatment serum HPV DNA, but this result was not
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment serum HPV DNA was associated with higher N category and
overall disease stage. However, pretreatment serum HPV DNA does not appear to
have clinical usefulness as a marker for disease recurrence among patients with
OPC.
