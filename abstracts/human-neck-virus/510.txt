Overall, health professionals had good knowledge of HPV (mean score: 9.97 out of 12). Oncologists had significantly greater knowledge than specialist nurses, speech and language therapists and 'other' health professionals. Most were willing to discuss HPV with patients (mean=4.3 out of 5). Willingness to discuss HPV in the future was associated with higher HPV knowledge (r=0.35, p<0.001), fewer negative and more positive attitudes towards discussing HPV (r=-0.23 and r=0.20 respectively, both p<0.001), fewer personal barriers (r=-0.49, p<0.001) and greater confidence (r=0.58, p<0.001).
