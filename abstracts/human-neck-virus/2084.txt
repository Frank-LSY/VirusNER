Importance: An escalating incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been reported predominantly
among middle-aged adults. However, HPV infection is believed to occur many years 
before cancer develops, and tissue studies suggest that HPV DNA is found in the
majority of OPSCC diagnosed in patients 65 years or older.
Objective: To update the trends in OPSCC incidence using US cancer registry data,
with an emphasis on age-specific trends.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) database (2000-2012) were queried to compare changes in
incidence and survival trends in OPSCC with selected tobacco-related cancers
(larynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, lung) and an HPV-related cancer (anus). A
total of 40 264 patients who received a diagnosis of OPSCC from 2000 to 2012 were
included. Elderly patients were defined as those 65 years or older.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The annual percentage change in OPSCC incidence from 
2000 to 2012, stratified according to age group.
Results: Among the 40 264 patients who received a diagnosis of OPSCC from 2000 to
2012, 13 313 (33.1%) were aged 65 years or older and 80.3% were male. Significant
increases in the age-adjusted incidence of OPSCC were observed during the study
period for both younger adults aged 45 to 64 years (annual percentage change
[APC], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.76-2.86; P < .001) and patients 65 years or older (APC,
2.92; 95% CI, 2.32-3.51; P < .001). These changes were driven predominantly by
base-of-tongue and tonsil cancers in men. Concomitantly, the incidence of
tobacco-associated head and neck cancers decreased for elderly patients (larynx: 
APC, -1.54; 95% CI, -2.00 to -1.08; P < .001; oral cavity: APC, -1.23; 95% CI,
-1.84 to -0.62; P = .001; hypopharynx: APC, -2.44; 95% CI, -3.01 to -1.86;
P < .001), whereas the incidence of anal cancer significantly increased (APC,
4.42; 95% CI, 3.28 to 5.57; P < .001). Furthermore, improved overall and
cause-specific survival over time were observed for both younger and elderly
patients with OPSCC. Nevertheless, absolute cause-specific survival remained
worse for elderly patients (3-year CSS, 60.8%; 95% CI, 59.6%-61.9%) in comparison
with those aged 45 to 64 years (75.7%; 95% CI, 75.1%-76.4%; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of OPSCC is increasing among elderly
patients in the United States, likely driven by HPV-associated cancers. Given the
unique challenges related to treating elderly patients with OPSCC, their limited 
enrollment in clinical trials, and the aging US population, clinical studies
investigating improved therapeutic strategies for elderly patients with
HPV-positive OPSCC should be performed.
