PURPOSE: Advances in tumor biology and clinical trials indicate that p53 transfer
is an alternative therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of
this phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and biologic 
activity of multiple intraepithelial injections of recombinant adenovirus
(rAd)-p53 in patients with dysplastic oral leukoplakia (OLK), the most common
precursor of the oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen Chinese patients clinically and
histopathologically diagnosed as having dysplastic OLK were recruited for this
study. On a 15-day cycle, intraepithelial injections of rAd-p53 were administered
once every 3 days at dose levels of 1 x 10(8) virus particles/cm(2). During
treatment, patients were monitored for adverse events, and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay was used to detect the serum antiadenoviral immunoglobulin
(Ig) G/IgM. Incisional biopsies were performed 24 to 48 hours after the last
injection, and immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expression of
p53, p21, and bcl-2. The patients were followed up for 6 months to observe the
initial clinical effect.
RESULTS: All 18 patients received a total cycle without dose-limiting toxicity,
and administration was feasible and well tolerated. Adenovirus IgG/IgM turned
from negative to positive after the 4 injections with rAd-p53. After treatment,
p53 protein expression and p21 protein expression were significantly enhanced
(100% and 89.9%, respectively), yet bcl-2 protein presented low expression
(16.7%). During the treatment and follow-up, 13 patients (72.2%) showed a
clinical response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraepithelial injections of Gendicine (SiBiono GeneTech, Shenzhen,
China) were safe, feasible, and biologically active for patients with dysplastic 
OLK. It may be a promising treatment for OLK.
