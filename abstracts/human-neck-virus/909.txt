Necrotising fasciitis is a rare severe infection of the soft tissues and deep
fascia, which is associated with a significant level of mortality. Involvement of
the head and neck is uncommon, and necrotising fasciitis of the periorbital area 
even rarer. We present a case of bilateral periorbital necrotising fasciitis
following shingles in an otherwise healthy immunocompetent patient.
