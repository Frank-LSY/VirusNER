Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) accounts for 3% of all
cancers. Most patients present with locally advanced disease, where multimodality
therapies are used with curative intent. Despite favorable early local treatment 
results, about one third of the patients will eventually develop metastatic
disease. Immunotherapy offers a novel therapeutic strategy beyond cytotoxic
chemotherapy, with initial approvals in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. 
HPV-associated SCCHN is a distinct subset, with unique epidemiology and treatment
outcomes. Both subsets of SCCHN (HPV-related or not) are particularly favorable
for immunotherapy, as immune evasion and dysregulation have been shown to play a 
key role in the initiation and progression of disease. This review focuses on the
latest developments in immunotherapy in SCCHN, with a particular focus on
DNA-based approaches including vaccine and adoptive cellular therapies.
