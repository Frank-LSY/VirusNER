OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes in
nasal inverted papilloma (NIP), and to evaluate the relationship between HPV and 
NIP.
METHODS: Twenty-one HPV subtypes were detected in paraffin-embedded tissues of
101 cases of NIP by flow through hybridization and gene chip (HybriMax), 24 cases
of normal nasal mucosa were used as controls.
RESULTS: HPV positive rates of NIP were 64.36% (65/101). Benign NIP group, NIP
with atypical hyperplasia group, NIP with cancerous group of HPV positive rates
were 59.7% (46/77), 81.8% (18/22) and 50% (1/2) respectively. The control group
was negative (0/24). The comparison between NIP group and control group was
statistically significant (chi(2) = 32.178, P < 0.05). Benign NIP group and NIP
with atypical hyperplasia group were compared, but no statistically significance 
(chi(2) = 3.649, P = 0.056) was found. The constituent ratio of benign NIP group 
and NIP with atypical hyperplasia group in high, low-risk HPV subtypes infections
was compared, a statistically significance (chi(2) = 10.412, P < 0.05) was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of NIP was related with HPV infection. High-risk HPV 
subtype infections or multiple infections will prompt benign NIP to NIP with
atypical hyperplasia. Understanding the distribution of HPV subtypes in the NIP
is helpful to predict the clinical behavior.
