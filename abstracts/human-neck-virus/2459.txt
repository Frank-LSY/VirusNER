BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who are infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) are less likely to receive cancer treatment compared with
HIV-uninfected individuals. However, to the authors' knowledge, the impact of
insurance status and comorbidities is unknown.
METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base were used to study nonelderly
adults diagnosed with several common cancers from 2003 to 2011. Cancer treatment 
was defined as chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or any combination during the
first course of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine
associations between HIV status and lack of cancer treatment, and identify
predictors for lack of treatment among HIV-infected patients.
RESULTS: A total of 10,265 HIV-infected and 2,219,232 HIV-uninfected cases were
included. In multivariate analysis, HIV-infected patients with cancer were found 
to be more likely to lack cancer treatment for cancers of the head and neck
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09-2.01),
upper gastrointestinal tract (aOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.04-3.37), colorectum (aOR,
1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.48), lung (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.19-2.76), breast (aOR, 2.14;
95% CI, 1.16-3.98), cervix (aOR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.77-4.45), prostate (aOR, 2.16;
95% CI, 1.69-2.76), Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.66-2.22), and diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.65-2.00). Predictors of a lack of
cancer treatment among HIV-infected individuals varied by tumor type (solid tumor
vs lymphoma), but black race and a lack of private insurance were found to be
predictors for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, HIV-infected patients with cancer appear to be
less likely to receive cancer treatment regardless of insurance and
comorbidities. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest study 
of cancer treatment in HIV-infected patients with cancer in the United States and
provides evidence of cancer treatment disparities even after controlling for
differences with regard to insurance status and comorbidities. Further work
should focus on addressing differential cancer treatment. Cancer
