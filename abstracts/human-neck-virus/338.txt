AIM: To assess whether poorly differentiated tumors and non-keratinizing tumors
have similar demographic and clinical characteristics as human papilloma virus
(HPV)-positive tumors in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort included patients diagnosed with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2012 identified in the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database.
RESULTS: Poorly differentiated tumors were associated with early T stage (odds
ratio (OR)=1.23), nodal metastasis (OR=1.66) and tonsil fossa origin (OR=1.22).
Non-keratinizing tumors were associated with early T stage (OR=1.23), nodal
metastasis (OR=1.66) and tonsil fossa origin (OR=1.22). Poorly differentiated
tumors were associated with improved overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio
(HR)=0.78, p<0.001). Non-keratinizing tumors were associated with improved OS
(HR=0.71, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Histological grade and keratinization may be useful surrogates to
adjust for the effects of HPV status in oropharyngeal cancer studies utilizing
population-based cancer databases.
