HPV-positive OPC appears to have increased worldwide. HPV status has a strong prognostic effect, and, in combination with smoking status, primary, and nodal stage, is useful in the risk stratification of OPC. HPV-positive OPC responds better to chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and postoperative chemoradiotherapy than HPV-negative tumours, with improved survival outcomes. There remain concerns regarding the efficacy of HPV detection assays in clinical practice. HPV-negative head and neck cancer still accounts for the largest subset of patients that we treat and carries poor survival outcomes.
