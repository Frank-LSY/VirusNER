OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of fever and facial and dental pain in 
adults suspected of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.
REVIEW METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on March 18,
2013. We included articles reporting studies on the diagnostic value of fever or 
facial and dental pain in patients suspected of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
For included articles, the reported study design was assessed for directness of
evidence and risk of bias. Prevalences, positive predictive values, and negative 
predictive values were extracted.
RESULTS: Of 3171 unique records, we included 1 study with a high directness of
evidence and a moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial
rhinosinusitis was 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.35). We could not
extract posterior probabilities with accompanying positive and negative
predictive values. The study reported an odds ratio from univariate analysis for 
fever of 1.02 (0.52 to 2.00) and 1.65 (0.83 to 3.28) for facial and dental pain. 
In subsequent multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of facial and dental pain was
1.86 (1.06 to 3.29).
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: There is 1 study with moderate risk of bias,
reporting data in such a manner that we could not assess the value of fever and
facial and dental pain in adults suspected of an acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. 
Therefore, these symptoms should not be used in clinical practice to distinguish 
between a bacterial and viral source of acute rhinosinusitis or for decision
making about prescribing antibiotic treatment.
