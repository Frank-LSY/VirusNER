Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been shown to represent a major independent risk
factor for head and neck squamous cell cancer, in particular for oropharyngeal
carcinoma. This type of cancer is rapidly evolving in the Western world, with
rising trends particularly in the young, and represents a distinct
epidemiological, clinical, and molecular entity. It is the aim of this review to 
give a detailed description of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and
posttranscriptional changes that underlie the phenotype of this deadly disease.
The review will also link these changes and examine what is known about the
interactions between the host genome and viral genome, and investigate changes
specific for the viral genome. These data are then integrated into an updated
model of HPV-induced head and neck carcinogenesis.
