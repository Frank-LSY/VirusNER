BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important cause of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), especially in young people. These tumours
overexpress p16 and respond well to treatment. The rapid detection of HPV in
patients with HNSCC may expedite treatment when p16 status is not immediately
available.
METHODS: Saliva-based DNA collection kits and nested polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) were used to determine the HPV status of 62 individuals with biopsy-proven 
HNSCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine tumour p16 status.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. Twenty-nine samples
(47%) were positive for HPV DNA, the majority of which were high risk (HR)
subtypes (79%). Patients who tested positive for HR HPV were more likely to have 
a tumour arising in the oropharynx compared to a non-oropharyngeal site (74 vs
26%; p = 0.003). A positive HR HPV saliva assay was 100% specific (95% CI
59-100%) and had a 100% positive predictive value (95% CI 75-100%) for a p16
positive tumour arising in the oropharynx. In contrast, a negative HR HPV assay
had a 96% negative predictive value (95% CI 80-100%) for tumours arising in a
non-oropharyngeal site. Independent of site, the saliva assay had a sensitivity
of 77% (95% CI 54-91%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 77-99%), respectively,
for a p16 positive tumour.
CONCLUSION: We show that a saliva based assay is an effective method for
detecting HPV in patients with HNSCC and that a positive HR HPV test is highly
specific for p16 positive tumours arising in the oropharynx. This simple and
rapid test could be used in cases where a biopsy of the primary tumour is not
readily available.
