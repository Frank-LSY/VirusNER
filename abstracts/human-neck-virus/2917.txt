Tonsillitis and pharyngitis are among the most common infections in the head and 
neck. Viral tonsillitis is usually caused by enterovirus, influenza,
parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (causing infectious 
mononucleosis). Acute bacterial tonsillitis is most commonly caused by group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci. On the other hand, pseudomembranous and necrotizing 
tonsillitis are usually caused by fusiform bacilli and spirochetes. Here we
report what is, to our knowledge, the first case of necrotizing tonsillitis
caused by group C beta-hemolytic streptococci.
