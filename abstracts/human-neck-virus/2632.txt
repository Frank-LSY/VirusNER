We report here the clinical presentation and subsequent autopsy of a 90-year-old 
man who developed small papules with pain and swelling in his right ear. On
admission, he exhibited right facial nerve paralysis, neck stiffness and Kernig's
sign. The cell count was elevated and the varicella-zoster virus-PCR was positive
in the CSF. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense lesions in the
left pons and left temporal lobe, in FLAIR images. We diagnosed the patient with 
Ramsay Hunt syndrome and meningoencephalitis due to varicella-zoster virus.
Although the symptoms of meningitis improved following treatment with intravenous
acyclovir (750 mg/day initially, raised to 1,125 mg/day), 16 days after
admission, he died suddenly due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The autopsy
findings included lymphocytic infiltration of the leptomeninges and perivascular 
space of the cerebrum, and slight parenchyma in the left temporal lobe and
insula, as the main histological features. Encephalitis due to varicella zoster
virus has been recognized as a vasculopathy affecting large and small vessels.
Pathological confirmation is rare in varicella zoster virus meningoencephalitis.
