Objective To determine the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in the larynx without the bias of
other sublocations, and to describe the different serotypes of HPV and their
impact on overall and disease-free survival after 10-year follow-up. Study Design
Retrospective case series with chart review of ear, nose, and throat oncologic
database. Setting Academic tertiary care hospital. Subjects A total of 123
samples of larynx squamous cell carcinoma were included, only from the glottis
and treated only with surgery between 1977 and 2005. Methods DNA extraction was
carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent visualization was
performed in low-density arrays. Results were compared with histologic,
clinicopathologic, and survival parameters, with a 10-year follow-up. Results HPV
DNA was detected in 22.76% (n = 28) of the samples. Eleven genotypes were
detected, 2 of which had never been described in the larynx (HPV43 and HPV62). No
increasing trend of HPV was observed over time. HPV presence did not correlate
with better survival during the follow-up. Smoking was proven as an independent
factor in relation to the presence of HPV. Conclusion HPV may represent a notable
factor in the development of a subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
without significant influence on overall and disease-free survival. More studies,
including oncogene transcription proteins, would be necessary to draw more
relevant conclusions about the relevance of HPV infection in the larynx.
