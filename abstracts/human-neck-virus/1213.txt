OBJECTIVES: Despite several randomized trials, the optimal chemotherapy paradigm 
for locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPSCC) is controversial. This
population-based analysis assessed the overall survival (OS) benefit of induction
chemotherapy (IC) for patients with stage III-IVB OPSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients in the National Cancer Database with stage
III-IVA-B OPSCC treated with curative-dose radiotherapy and IC or concurrent
chemotherapy (CRT) between 2003 and 2011 were eligible. The primary outcome was
OS, and secondary endpoints included OS for high-risk (T4 and/or N3 disease) and 
human papillomavirus (HPV) subsets.
RESULTS: Of the 14,856 analyzed patients, 78% and 22% received CRT and IC,
respectively. With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 44 months, the
5-year OS probability for the entire cohort was 66% (66% CRT vs. 64% IC,
p=0.022). Multivariable survival analysis showed no significant difference
between CRT and IC (hazard ratio, HR, 0.95 for IC, p=0.255), and sensitivity
analyses to adjust for immortal time bias brought the HR to 1.0 (p=0.859). There 
was also no OS difference for high-risk patients. There was a trend in favor of
CRT for HPV-positive OPSCC (HR 1.63 with IC, p=0.064), with a significant OS
benefit for HPV-negative, high-risk OPSCC (HR 0.63, p=0.048).
CONCLUSION: For the vast majority of patients, including HPV-positive
individuals, there was no difference in OS with IC, arguing for CRT to remain as 
the standard therapy. Subset analysis revealed a small cohort of aggressive
cancer (T4/N3 HPV-negative) which may benefit from from IC, although selection
bias could not be ruled out.
