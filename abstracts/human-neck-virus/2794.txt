aggressive breast cancer.

Periostin (POSTN), a secreted homodimeric protein that binds integrins αvβ3,
αvβ5, and α6β4, was originally found to be expressed in fetal tissues and in the 
adult upon injury particularly bone fractures due to its role in remodelling and 
repair. Recently it was found to be over-expressed in human breast cancer and a
variety of other tumour types including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
where its overexpression correlates with increased tumour invasion. Progress in
studying its functional role in tumour pathogenesis has been hampered by the
paucity of antibodies for its specific and sensitive detection. It has proven
very difficult to obtain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against this highly
conserved protein but we report here that combining infection of mice with
lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), a B cell activating arterivirus,
with conjugation of human POSTN to ovalbumin as an immunogenic carrier, enabled
us to develop six mAbs recognizing both human and mouse POSTN and inhibiting its 
binding to αvβ3 integrin. Two of the mAbs, MPB4B1 and MPC5B4, were tested and
found to inhibit POSTN-induced migration of human endothelial colony forming
cells. All six mAbs recognized amino acids 136-51 (APSNEAWDNLDSDIRR) within the
POSTN fascilin (FAS) 1-1 domain revealing the functional importance of this
motif; this was further highlighted by the ability of aa 136-151 peptide to
inhibit integrin-mediated cell migration. Immunohistochemistry using MPC5B4,
indicated that breast tumour cell POSTN expression was a strong prognostic
indicator, along with tumour size, lymph node, and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) status.
