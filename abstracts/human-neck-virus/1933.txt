Immunohistochemistry analysis of p16INK4a in head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC) tumor samples revealed that 28% of tumors showed
nuclear/cytoplasmic p16INK4a localization, while 37% of tumors had cytoplasmic
p16INK4a. Our previous study showed that p16INK4a inhibits the DNA repair
response independently of its function in the cell cycle, suggesting that
p16INK4a subcellular localization should be considered during stratification of
HNSCC patients.Using p16INK4a mutants with different localization signals, we
found that expression of nuclear p16INK4a, but not cytoplasmic p16INK4a impaired 
RAD51 foci formation, indicating that nuclear localization of p16INK4a is crucial
for its function in DNA repair. We next investigated the role of p16INK4a
subcellular localization in radiation response in a retrospective cohort of 261
HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. We found that only HNSCC patients
expressing nuclear p16INK4a expression showed better outcome, locoregional
control and disease free survival, after chemoradiation. In concordance with the 
patient data, only expression of nuclear p16INK4a increased radiosensitivity of
HNSCC cells. These results implicate nuclear p16INK4a expression as a potent
marker to predict radiation response of HNSCC patients and should be taken into
account in intensification or de-escalation studies.
