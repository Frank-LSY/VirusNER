BACKGROUND: Tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status is an important prognostic
factor in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(SCCHN). Prognostic value in recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) disease remains to
be confirmed. This retrospective analysis of the EXTREME trial, comparing
chemotherapy plus cetuximab with chemotherapy first line in R/M SCCHN,
investigated efficacy and prognosis according to tumor p16 and HPV status.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paired tissue samples were used: p16INK4A expression was
assessed by immunohistochemistry, and HPV status determined in extracted DNA
samples using oligonucleotide hybridization assays.
RESULTS: Altogether, 416 of 442 patients had tumor samples available for p16 and 
HPV: 10% of tumors were p16 positive and 5% were HPV positive. Adding cetuximab
to chemotherapy improved survival, irrespective of tumor p16 or HPV status. This 
pattern remained in a combined analysis of p16 and HPV. p16 positivity and HPV
positivity were associated with prolonged survival compared with p16 negativity
and HPV negativity. Subgroup analysis of patients with oropharyngeal cancer
demonstrated a similar pattern to all evaluable patients.
CONCLUSION: The results from this analysis suggest that p16 and HPV status have
prognostic value in R/M SCCHN and survival benefits of chemotherapy plus
cetuximab over chemotherapy alone are independent of tumor p16 and HPV status.
