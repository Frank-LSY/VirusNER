Human papillomavirus is an established cause of oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma. Similar to cervical cancer, these cancers are usually caused by
high-risk human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and are associated with high-risk 
sexual behaviors. Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma typically affects the palatine and lingual tonsils and frequently
results in cystic neck metastases. The histopathology of this subset of head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma is unique and typically characterized by poorly
differentiated, nonkeratinizing morphology with a basaloid appearance. These
tumors occur in younger patients and are more often seen in nonsmokers compared
with conventional oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. The
incidence of human papillomavirus-associated squamous cell carcinoma is
increasing. Recognition of this unique clinicopathologic subset of head and neck 
carcinoma is important because these patients typically respond more favorably to
organ-sparing treatment modalities and have an improved prognosis.
