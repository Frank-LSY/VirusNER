PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to combine gene expression profiles and
clinical factors to provide a better prediction model of local control after
chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression data were available for a series of 92
advanced stage head and neck cancer patients treated with primary
chemoradiotherapy. The effect of the Chung high-risk and Slebos HPV expression
profiles on local control was analyzed in a model with age at diagnosis, gender, 
tumor site, tumor volume, T-stage and N-stage and HPV profile status.
RESULTS: Among 75 patients included in the study, the only factors significantly 
predicting local control were tumor site (oral cavity vs. Pharynx, hazard ratio
4.2 [95% CI 1.4-12.5]), Chung gene expression status (high vs. Low risk profile, 
hazard ratio 4.4 [95% CI 1.5-13.3]) and HPV profile (negative vs. Positive
profile, hazard ratio 6.2 [95% CI 1.7-22.5]).
CONCLUSIONS: Chung high-risk expression profile and a negative HPV expression
profile were significantly associated with increased risk of local recurrence
after chemoradiotherapy in advanced pharynx and oral cavity tumors, independent
of clinical factors.
