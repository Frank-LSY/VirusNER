Replication-selective tumor-specific viruses present a novel approach for treatment of neoplastic disease. They are designed to induce lysis after propagation within the tumor. Human telomerase is active in over 85% of primary cancers and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression.
