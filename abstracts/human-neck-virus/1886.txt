The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is on the rise.
This is largely due to the rapid increase in HPV positive OPSCC, which has been
shown to confer a survival advantage. HPV negative OPSCC, however, has a more
aggressive tumor biology and is a challenge to treat with standard current
therapies. Chemoradiation has demonstrated poor locoregional control in HPV
negative OPSCC, and open surgeries are associated with high morbidity. Transoral 
robotic surgery (TORS) has been proposed as an option to both intensify treatment
and decrease surgical morbidity for patients with HPV negative OPSCC. TORS can be
utilized as a primary treatment or in persistent, recurrent, or second primary
OPSCC. There is emerging data showing improved functional outcomes with TORS
versus open surgery or chemoradiation. Unfortunately, there have been no
randomized trials comparing TORS to chemoradiation in HPV negative OPSCC. This
article will review utility of TORS for HPV negative OPSCC.
