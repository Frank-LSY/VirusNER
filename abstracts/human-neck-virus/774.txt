Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is defined as herpes zoster infection of the head and 
neck that involves the facial nerve. Immunocompromised people, such as those
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are predisposed to herpes
zoster. However, reports of RHS in patients with HIV are rare. We report two
cases of RHS in patients with HIV at our hospital, located in southern Brazil. We
hope this report will increase the awareness of this condition among doctors
caring for patients with HIV.
