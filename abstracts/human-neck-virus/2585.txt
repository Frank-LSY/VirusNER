OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients treated with radiation therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series without comparison group.
METHODS: Patients who underwent radiation therapy for oropharyngeal or laryngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma completed a 3-night home sleep test (HST), Epworth
Sleepiness Scale, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, and University of
Washington Quality of Life questionnaire. Exclusion criteria included oncologic
surgical procedures, active disease, history of tracheotomy, history of OSA, or
completion of radiation therapy within the last 3 months.
RESULTS: Sixteen HNSCC patients completed the HST, with 50% (8) demonstrating
objective evidence of OSA ranging from mild to severe (range 5.6-38.8, median
13.9). Median age was 61.6 years, with a median body mass index (BMI) of 29.8,
and 13 of the subjects were male. There were no differences in age, BMI, median
radiation dose, tumor primary site or stage, human papilloma virus status, or
comorbidity status between the OSA and non-OSA groups. Self-reported
questionnaire scores were no different between the two groups. OSA patients had a
nonsignificant shorter time interval between the completion of radiation and the 
HST date (1.8 vs. 3.4 years, P = 0.065) and higher rate of gastrostomy tube
placement during radiation (62.5% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.059).
CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the prevalence of 
OSA is increased in the head and neck irradiated patient when compared to the
general population. Self-report of sleep symptoms alone may be unreliable to
determine risk of OSA in the HNSCC population.
