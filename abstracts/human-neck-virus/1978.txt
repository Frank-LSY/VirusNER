OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing surgical
management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCCA) with transoral
robotic surgery (TORS) and neck dissection.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, consecutive patient series from two
separate protocols in a tertiary academic medical center.
METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment for OPSCCA were selected from a
prospective protocol evaluating functional and oncologic outcomes following TORS 
with a comparator group of OPSCCA patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy
(CRT) participating in a separate prospective protocol.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients represented the TORS group and 38 the CRT group.
Twenty (48%) of the TORS patients received surgery only, whereas nine (21%)
underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and 13 (31%) adjuvant CRT. Adjuvant therapy
patients had a higher overall T (P =.0007) and N (P < .0001) stage than the
TORS-only group. Surgery resulted in stage changes in 18 (43%) patients, leading 
to alteration in therapy for nine (21%) patients. The 3-year overall survival
(OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and locoregional control was 74% versus
90% (P = .30), 94% versus 94% (P = .91), and 72% versus 91% (P = .19) for the
TORS-alone versus TORS plus adjuvant therapy groups, respectively. Comparison
with the CRT group revealed a survival benefit in the TORS group approaching
significance, with a 3-year OS of 83% versus 57% (P = .06) and DSS of 94% versus 
85% (P = .08), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary surgical management of OPSCCA with TORS and neck dissection 
provides accurate staging information, which can lead to the appropriate
selection of subsequent therapy. This approach does not compromise survival and
warrants additional investigation.
