BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in oropharyngeal
cancer (SCC) is well established. The annual incidence of oropharyngeal SCC in
Israel is considerably lower than that in the United States. The purpose of this 
study was to assess the rate of HPV-related oropharyngeal SCC in Israel.
METHODS: The cohort included patients with oropharyngeal SCC who were treated
during 1999 to 2011 in Israel. HPV typing was carried out using reverse
hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Of the 74 patients analyzed, 25 (33.7%) had detectable HPV DNA. Patients
in the HPV-positive group tended to be younger, with a higher rate of nodal
metastases, and no history of smoking (p < .02).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a rate of HPV-related oropharyngeal SCC in
Israel as approximately 3-fold lower than in Western countries. Low exposure to
HPV-16, a lower rate of transformation, to cancer or protective genetic factors
may contribute to the lower rate of oropharyngeal SCC in Israel. © 2015 Wiley
