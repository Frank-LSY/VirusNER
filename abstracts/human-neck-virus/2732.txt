Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world and is
caused by four distinct viruses (type 1 to 4) that are closely related
antigenically. Infection by dengue virus may be asymptomatic or may lead to
undifferentiated fever, dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever. Recent
observations indicate that the clinical profile of dengue is changing and the
neurological complications are being reported more frequently. The neurological
features includeheadache, seizures, neck stiffness, depressed sensorium,
behavioural disorders, delirium, paralysis and cranial nerve palsies. Such
neurological symptoms in dengue fever wereattributed to cerebral oedema,
haemorrhage, haemoconcentration due to increasing vascular permeability,
coagulopathy and release of toxic substances. Cerebral oedema, encephalitis-like 
changes (oedema and scattered focal lesions), intracranial haemorrhages as well
as selective involvement of bilateral hippocampus in dengue infection have been
reported previously on selective neuro-imaging but thalamic involvement is rare. 
We here report a case of a typical presentation of encephalopathy with left sided
complete hemiplegia due to thalamic involvement in dengue infection.
