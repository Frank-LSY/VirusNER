Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) related to human
papillomavirus (HPV) represent a growing and distinct patient cohort with unique 
molecular and epidemiologic characteristics. These patients have markedly
improved survival outcomes compared to those with traditional HNC, leading some
to advocate for treatment dose reduction. In this article, we review ongoing
clinical trials investigating several ways to reduce therapeutic intensity for
patients with HPV-positive HNC, discuss the risks and benefits associated with
these trials, and summarize the data underlying the advancement of dose reduction
trials for patients with HPV-positive HNC.
