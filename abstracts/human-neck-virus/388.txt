We report an unusual case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), presenting initially
as a retropharyngeal collection. We discuss the investigation, diagnosis and
management of NPC and furthermore review the literature of NPC, emphasising the
varied presentation. A 44-year-old Caucasian male ex-smoker presented with a
10-day history of a painless left-sided neck lump; progressive dysphagia and
unintentional weight loss. Examination demonstrated a large left posterior
pharyngeal swelling with soft palatal effacement, confirmed on nasoendoscopy. A
CT scan revealed a fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space, which partially
occluded the nasopharynx, and numerous satellite lesions were identified along
with cervical lymphadenopathy. The suspected abscess was drained in theatre and
nasopharyngeal biopsies were taken. These revealed Epstein-Barr virus-positive
NPC. Staging investigations revealed a T4N2M0l carcinoma. Treatment consisted of 
radical chemoradiation therapy with curative intent. NPC is known for its varied 
and late presentation, and is an important condition to be aware of when
considering a differential diagnosis of pharyngeal masses.
