Cancer of unknown primary of the head and neck is a challenging entity for the
oncologist. The role of human papilloma virus/p16 in carcinogenesis and in
prognosis is well established in certain HNSCC especially in that of the
oropharynx. In the case of occult primary of the head and neck the role of
HPV/p16 positivity is not well defined regarding prognosis and localization of
the primary. An independent review of PubMed and ScienceDirect database was
performed up to May 2014 using combinations of terms such as "occult primary of
the head and neck", "CUP of the head and neck" "metastatic cervical squamous cell
carcinoma of unknown primary", "HPV" and "HPV and head and neck cancer".
Literature review shows a strong association between HPV/p16 positivity and
primary location in the oropharynx in patients with CUP of the head and neck as
well as a better clinical outcome. HPV positivity and p16 overexpression could be
used as surrogate markers in the search of the primary site of patients with CUP 
of the head and neck therefore maybe guiding treatment decisions.
