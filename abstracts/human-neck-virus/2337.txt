PURPOSE: The optimal roles for imaging-based biomarkers in the management of
head-and-neck cancer remain undefined. Unresolved questions include whether
functional or anatomic imaging might improve mortality risk assessment for this
disease. We addressed these issues in a prospective institutional trial.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-eight patients with locally advanced
pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell cancer were enrolled. Each underwent pre- and
post-chemoradiotherapy contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging.
Imaging parameters were correlated with survival outcomes.
RESULTS: Low post-radiation primary tumor FDG avidity correlated with improved
survival on multivariate analysis; so too did complete primary tumor response by 
CT alone. Although both imaging modalities lacked sensitivity, each had high
specificity and negative predictive value for disease-specific mortality risk
assessment. Kaplan-Meier estimates confirmed that both CT and FDG-PET/CT stratify
patients into distinct high- and low-probability survivorship groups on the basis
of primary tumor response to radiotherapy. Subset analyses demonstrated that the 
prognostic value for each imaging modality was primarily derived from patients at
high risk for local treatment failure (human papillomavirus [HPV]-negative
disease, nonoropharyngeal primary disease, or tobacco use).
CONCLUSIONS: CT alone and FDG-PET/CT are potentially useful tools in
head-and-neck cancer-specific mortality risk assessment after radiotherapy,
particularly for selective use in cases of high-risk HPV-unrelated disease. Focus
should be placed on corroboration and refinement of patient selection for
imaging-based biomarkers in future studies.
