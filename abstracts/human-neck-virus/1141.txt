PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major risk factor for specific cancers
of the head and neck, particularly malignancies of the tonsil and base of the
tongue. However, the role of HPV in the development of laryngeal cancer has not
been definitively established. We conducted a population-based, cancer registry
study to evaluate and characterize the genotype-specific prevalence of HPV in
invasive laryngeal cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S.
METHODS: The presence of genotype-specific HPV DNA was evaluated using the Linear
Array HPV Genotyping Test and the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Assay in
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from 148 invasive laryngeal cancer cases 
diagnosed in 1993-2004 within the catchment area of three U.S. SEER cancer
registries.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 31 of 148 (21%) invasive laryngeal cancers.
Thirteen different genotypes were detected. Overall, HPV 16 and HPV 33 were the
most commonly detected types. HPV was detected in 33% (9/27) of women compared
with 18% (22/121) of men (p = 0.08). After adjustment for age and year of
diagnosis, female patients were more likely to have HPV-positive laryngeal tumors
compared to males (adjusted OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.07-7.51). Viral genotype
differences were also observed between the sexes. While HPV 16 and 18 constituted
half of HPV-positive cases occurring in men, among women, only 1 was HPV 16
positive and none were positive for HPV 18. Overall 5-year survival did not vary 
by HPV status.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV may be involved in the development of a subset of laryngeal
cancers and its role may be more predominant in women compared to men.
