OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to analyze the effect of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-associated T1-2 node-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) on nodal response, recurrent disease, and survival in patients 
treated according to the Rotterdam protocol.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: In total, 77 patients with T1-2 OPSCC with nodal disease, treated
between 2000 and 2012, were included in this study. Patients were treated
according to the Rotterdam protocol: 46 Gy of IMRT followed by a local boost
using cyberknife or brachytherapy (22 Gy) and neck dissection. The presence of
HPV was determined by p16INK4A immunostaining. Outcomes were overall survival,
disease-free survival, and the extent of nodal response. Nodal stage was
determined following the 7th and 8th American Joint Cancer Committee/Union for
International Cancer Control classification.
RESULTS: Overall, 68.4% of patients had p16-positive disease, and 35.4% of all
patients achieved complete nodal response (pN0) after 46 Gy of
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Based on the 7th TNM classification,
nodal response (partial or complete) was significantly associated with HPV status
(P = .002). Patients with p16-positive OPSCC had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.6 to
achieve complete nodal response. However, smoking interacted with this effect.
Applying the 8th TNM classification, complete or partial response was associated 
with HPV status but was not significant (OR: 1.7, P = .138). Complete nodal
response led to 100% overall survival in p16-positive OPSCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV-related OPSCCs are associated with complete nodal response after
46 Gy of IMRT. Patients with full regional control (pN0) after IMRT and
subsequent neck dissection show a significantly better overall survival, but
smoking negatively interacts with this effect.
