INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk and prognostic factor for
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). Determining whether the incidence of HPV-associated
OPC is rising informs health policy.
METHODS: HPV status was ascribed using p16 immunohistochemistry in 683/1474 OPC
patients identified from the Princess Margaret Hospital's Cancer Registry (from
2000 to 2010). Missing p16 data was estimated using multiple (n=100) imputation
(MI) and validated using an independent OPC cohort (n=214). Non-OPC head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (n=3262) were also used for time-trend
comparison. Regression was used to compare HNSCC subsets and time-trends. The
c-index was used to measure the predictive ability of MI.
RESULTS: The incidence of OPC rose from 23.3% of all HNSCC in 2000 to 31.2% in
2010 (p=0.002). In the subset of OPC tested for p16, there was no change in p16
positivity over time (p=0.9). However, p16 testing became more frequent over time
(p<0.0001), but was nonetheless biased, favouring never-smokers [OR 1.87 (95% CI 
1.29-2.70)] and tumors of the tonsil [OR 2.30 (1.52-3.47)] or base-of-tongue [OR 
1.72 (1.10-2.70)]. These same factors were also associated with p16-positivity
[ORs 3.22 (1.27-8.16), 7.26 (3.50-15.1), 5.83 (2.70-12.7), respectively].
Following MI and normalization, the proportion of OPC that was p16-associated
rose from 39.8% in 2000 to 65.0% in 2010, p=0.002, fully explaining the rise in
OPC in our patient population.
CONCLUSION: The rise in HNSCC referrals seen from 2000 to 2010 at our institution
was driven primarily by p16-associated OPC. MI was necessary to derive reliable
conclusions when cases with missing data are considerable.
