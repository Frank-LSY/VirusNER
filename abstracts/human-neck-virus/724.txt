Poorly differentiated tumors were associated with early T stage (odds ratio (OR)=1.23), nodal metastasis (OR=1.66) and tonsil fossa origin (OR=1.22). Non-keratinizing tumors were associated with early T stage (OR=1.23), nodal metastasis (OR=1.66) and tonsil fossa origin (OR=1.22). Poorly differentiated tumors were associated with improved overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.78, p<0.001). Non-keratinizing tumors were associated with improved OS (HR=0.71, p<0.001).
