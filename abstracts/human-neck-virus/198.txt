An increasing subset of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCCA) is positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). Patients tend
to be younger, have a minimal or absent tobacco and ethanol abuse history,
increased number of lifetime sexual partners (particularly oral-genital sex), and
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCAs) arising in the oropharynx. The most common
HR-HPV associated with HNSCCA is HPV-16. HR-HPV positivity is associated with
decreased expression of the p53 and Rb genes, overexpression of p16, decreased
expression of EGFR, and a different genetic expression pattern compared with
patients with HR-HPV-negative SCCAs, leading to the conclusion that this is a
distinct clinical entity. Patients who have HR-HPV-positive HNSCCAs have an
improved prognosis, particularly those with oropharyngeal SCCAs, leading some to 
speculate that the intensity of treatment might be decreased. At present, whether
this can be done safely remains unclear.
