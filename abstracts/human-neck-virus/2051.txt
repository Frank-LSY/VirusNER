BACKGROUND: In this retrospective review, the authors examined
demographic/clinical characteristics and overall survival in patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx at a tertiary cancer center, and they
report the characteristics that influenced any observed survival trends over
time.
METHODS: The study included 3891 newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients
who presented at the authors' institution between 1955 and 2004.
RESULTS: Over time, patients presented at younger ages and were more likely to
have base of tongue or tonsil tumors and to be never-smokers or former smokers.
Patients who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2004 were almost half as likely to
die as those who were diagnosed before 1995 (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence
interval, 0.6-0.8). In both multivariable and recursive partitioning survival
analyses, the TNM staging system predicted the survival of patients who received 
treatment before 1995 but did not predict the survival patients treated during
the period from 1995 to 2004.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival among patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
oropharynx improved substantially over the past 50 years. The main contributing
factors were changes in clinical characteristics, in particular surrogates for
positive human papillomavirus status. The current TNM staging system for squamous
cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is inadequate. The incorporation of human
papillomavirus status and perhaps smoking status into the TNM system is
encouraged.
