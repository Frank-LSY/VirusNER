OBJECTIVE: Although whole-body fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron 
emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (18F-FDG PET/CT) is commonly
used for M staging of newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), some
patients may not benefit from this procedure. The present study investigated
which patients require this modality for M staging.
METHODS: Whole-body 18F FDG PET/CT results and clinical data were collected for
264 patients with newly diagnosed NPC. The relationships between distant
metastasis and age, gender, pathological type, lesion size, SUVmax-T, T staging, 
N staging, SUVmax-N and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) quantity were retrospectively
analysed to identify factors associated with increased risk.
RESULTS: Of the 264 patients, only 37 (14.0%) were diagnosed with distant
metastasis. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, EBV-positivity (OR=13.1;
95% CI:1.61,106.80), N staging (OR=3.05; 95% CI:1.41,6.63) and T staging
(OR=2.16; 95% CI:1.10, 4.24) were significantly related to distant metastasis
(all P<0.05). EBV DNA levels≥9000copies/ml, N3 stage and T4 stage were identified
as high risk factors. A low risk of distant metastasis was found in patients with
0-1 risk factors and in those with 2 specific risk factors, T3/T4 and N2/N3
staging. Patients with EBV DNA levels ≥9000copies/ml and N3 or T4 staging and
those with 3 risk factors had a medium or high risk, with a much higher incidence
of distant metastasis (χ2=29.896, P=0.000), and needed a whole-body 18F FDG
PET/CT for M staging.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the low incidence of distant metastasis, only patients with
medium or high risk need to undergo a whole-body scan.
