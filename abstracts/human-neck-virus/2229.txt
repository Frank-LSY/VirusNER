Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) can play a causative role in the development of
sinonasal tract malignancies. In fact, HPV may be the most significant causative 
agent implicated in sinonasal tumorigenesis and is implicated in as many as 21%
of sinonasal carcinomas. To date, there are no definitive, reliable and
cost-effective, diagnostic tests approved by the FDA for the unequivocal
determination of HPV status in head and neck cancers. We followed an exhaustive
algorithm to correctly test HPV infection, including a sequential approach with
p16INK4a IHC, viral DNA genotyping and in situ hybridization for E6/E7 mRNA.
Here, we report a case of sinonasal carcinoma with discordant results using HPV
test assays. The tumor we describe showed an irregular immunoreactivity for
p16INK4a, and it tested positive for HPV DNA; nevertheless, it was negative for
HR-HPV mRNA. We discuss the possible meaning of this discrepancy. It would be
advisable to test HPV transcriptional status of sinonasal carcinoma on a
diagnostic routine basis, not only by p16INK4a IHC assay, but also by HPV DNA
genotyping and HR-HPV mRNA assessment.
