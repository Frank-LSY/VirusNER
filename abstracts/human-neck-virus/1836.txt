Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) exhibit complex interactions with
the host immune system that may simultaneously explain resistance to various
therapeutic modalities and that may also provide opportunities for therapeutic
intervention. Discoveries in immunologic research over the last decade have led
to an increased understanding of these interactions as well as the development of
a multitude of investigational immunotherapies. Here, we describe the interaction
between HNSCC and the immune system, including a discussion of immune cells
involved with tumor carcinogenesis and the role of immune-modulating factors
derived from tumors. We also describe the current immunotherapeutic approaches
being investigated for HNSCC, including a discussion of the successes and
limitations. With this review, we hope to present HNSCC as a model to guide
future research in cancer immunology.
