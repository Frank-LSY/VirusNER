OBJECTIVE: The reported range of involvement of human papillomavirus (HPV) in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is wide because of the methods used to
detect HPV.
DATA SOURCES: A computerized Medline study was carried out using the following as
key words: "Papillomavirus Infections"[Mesh] and "Laryngeal Neoplasms"[Mesh].
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies that were included were written in English and
reported results of HPV DNA with RNA in laryngeal SCC.
RESULTS: There were six reported HPV mRNA extraction. Among these studies, Lewis 
et al reported that out of the 31 cases analyzed, only 2 were HPV DNA+ and of
these only 1 was mRNA HPV+ (3%). Halec et al reported 102 cases of which 32 were 
HPV DNA+ cases and of which only 6 were mRNA+ (5%). Chernock et al reported 76
cases of which 13 were HPV DNA+ cases and of which 4 were mRNA+ (5%). Masand
et al reported 8 cases of which 1 was HPV DNA+ case and none was mRNA+. Gheit
et al reported 43 cases of which 4 were HPV DNA+ cases and of which 2 were mRNA+ 
(4%). Castellsagné et al reported 1042 cases of which 59 were HPV DNA+ case and
of which 51 were mRNA+ (4.8%) CONCLUSIONS: When determining the role of HPV in
laryngeal SCC, evidence of HPV DNA warrants further examination for E6/E7 mRNA as
simple assays such as p16 are nonspecific in laryngeal SCC. Further studies of
HPV and its role in laryngeal SCC are warranted.
