BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus that is pathogenic
in birds but causes only mild flulike symptoms in human beings. NDV(F3aa)-GFP is 
a genetically modified, fusogenic NDV. We assessed the utility of NDV(F3aa)-GFP
in treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS AND RESULTS: At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, NDV(F3aa)-GFP
infection of 3 cell lines supported strong GFP expression by 36 hours. Four cell 
lines were highly sensitivite to viral cytotoxicity, with >75% of cells lysed by 
day 6 at MOI 0.1, and 2 other cell lines were partially susceptible. Murine SCC25
flank tumors exhibited robust GFP expression after a single intratumoral viral
injection and showed near-complete tumor regression over 34 days. There were no
adverse effects attributable to therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a fusogenic NDV exerts potent oncolytic effects 
against human head and neck cancer and support its continued investigation for
clinical application.
