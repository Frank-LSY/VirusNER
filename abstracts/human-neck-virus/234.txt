Human papilloma virus (HPV), usually type 16, has emerged as an aetiological and prognostic marker of oropharyngeal carcinomas, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with carcinoma of the head and neck. This makes the identification of cancers associated with these biomarkers important in the management of patients. We surveyed UK head and neck multidisciplinary teams by email using an online form to assess the use of biomarker testing. Overall 33 cancer networks were contacted and 28 (85%) responded. HPV tests were used in departments by 22 (79%) of our respondents, while only 3 (11%) used EGFR tests. The commonest reasons for not using them were lack of availability and lack of clinical indication.
