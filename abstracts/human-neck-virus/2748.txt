This study aims to identify the crucial miRNAs in Epstein-Barr virus-positive
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and their target genes. Gene expression profile
data (GSE12452) that included 31 NPC and 10 normal nasopharyngeal tissue
specimens were downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
using significance analysis of microarrays. The underlying function of DEGs was
predicted via Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
enrichment analyses. The miRNA sequencing dataset GSE14738 was also downloaded,
and expression levels of miRNA were calculated by the number of reads mapped to
each miRNA. The selected miRNAs were integrated into the miRecords database to
obtain their target genes. Target genes associated with DEGs were used to
construct the interaction network via Cytoscape. A total of 1437 DEGs between NPC
and control were identified, most of which were enriched in cell cycle and
extracellular matrix-receptor interaction signaling pathways. Furthermore, 112
miRNAs were considered upregulated in NPC samples. A total of 2228 relationships 
between 39 miRNAs and 1247 target genes were obtained, of which 182 relationships
between 32 miRNAs and 97 target genes were chosen to construct an interaction
network. The interactions between DEGs and the let-7 or miR-29 families appeared 
strongest in this network, where CDC25A, COL3A1, and COL1A1 were regulated by
several let-7 family members, while COL4A1 and COL5A2 were regulated by several
miR-29 family members. The let-7 and miR-29 families may be related to the
development of NPC by regulating the genes involved in cell cycle and
ECM-receptor interaction.
