Rapid and sensitive detection of influenza virus is of soaring importance to
prevent further spread of infections and adequate clinical treatment. Herein, an 
ultrasensitive colorimetric assay called magnetic nano(e)zyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (MagLISA) is suggested, in which silica-shelled magnetic
nanobeads (MagNBs) and gold nanoparticles are combined to monitor influenza A
virus up to femtogram per milliliter concentration. Two essential strategies for 
ultrasensitive sensing are designed, i.e., facile target separation by MagNBs and
signal amplification by the enzymelike activity of gold nanozymes (AuNZs). The
enzymelike activity was experimentally and computationally evaluated, where the
catalyticity of AuNZ was tremendously stronger than that of normal biological
enzymes. In the spiked test, a straightforward linearity was presented in the
range of 5.0 × 10-15-5.0 × 10-6g·mL-1 in detecting the influenza virus A (New
Caledonia/20/1999) (H1N1). The detection limit is up to 5.0 × 10-12 g·mL-1 only
by human eyes, as well as up to 44.2 × 10-15 g·mL-1 by a microplate reader, which
is the lowest record to monitor influenza virus using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay-based technology as far as we know. Clinically isolated human serum samples
were successfully observed at the detection limit of 2.6 PFU·mL-1. This novel
MagLISA demonstrates, therefore, a robust sensing platform possessing the
advances of fathomable sample separation, enrichment, ultrasensitive readout, and
anti-interference ability may reduce the spread of influenza virus and provide
immediate clinical treatment.
