PURPOSE: To analyze functional outcomes for patients treated on a phase 2 trial
of de-escalated chemoradiation therapy for human papillomavirus-positive
oropharyngeal cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient eligibility included p16-positive, stage III or IV
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1. 
Treatment was induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2, and carboplatin,
area under the curve (AUC) of 6 mg/ml/min, for 2 cycles every 21 days, followed
by concurrent paclitaxel, 30 mg/m2, every 7 days with dose-reduced radiation
therapy of 54 or 60 Gy. Trends in body weight and body mass index (BMI) were
analyzed with gastrostomy tube and narcotic use rates. Functional outcomes were
assessed using the University of Washington Quality of Life Scale and the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Scale.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were registered, of whom 40 were evaluable. Only 1
patient had a BMI deemed unhealthy at the completion of treatment. For the 15
patients (38%) with a normal BMI (18-25 kg/m2) before treatment, recovery back to
baseline occurred at approximately 18 months (average BMI, 23.2 kg/m2 vs
22.3 kg/m2; P=.09). In 2 patients (5%), gastrostomy tubes were placed during
treatment. No patient was enteral feeding tube-dependent at 6 months after
treatment. Ninety-five percent of patients tolerated a normal regular diet at
last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: De-escalated chemoradiation therapy may improve functional outcomes 
as indicated by the relatively low incidence of gastrostomy tube placement and
long-term dysphagia. In patients with a normal BMI prior to chemoradiation
therapy, BMI recovered to baseline levels.
