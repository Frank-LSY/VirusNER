BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: When treated by radiotherapy, patients with squamous cell
carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) possess a
clearly favorable prognosis as compared to those with HPV-negative HNSCC. The aim
of this work was to study whether the better outcomes might be caused by an
enhanced cellular radiosensitivity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiation response of five HPV/p16(INK4a)-positive and
five HPV-negative cell lines was characterized with regard to cellular
radiosensitivity by colony formation assay. Furthermore G1- and G2-arrest,
apoptosis and residual DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were analyzed by the
colcemid-based G1-efflux assay, propidium iodide staining, the detection of PARP 
cleavage, the fluorescence-based detection of caspase activity and the
immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci.
RESULTS: On average, the cellular radiosensitivity of the HNSCC cell lines
positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) was higher as compared to the sensitivity of a
panel of five HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines (SF3=0.2827 vs. 0.4455). The higher
sensitivity does not result from increased apoptosis or the execution of a
permanent G1-arrest, but is rather associated with both, elevated levels of
residual DSBs and extensive G2-arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased cellular radiosensitivity due to compromised DNA repair
capacity is likely to contribute to the improved outcome of patients with
HPV/p16(INK4a)-positive tumors when treated by radiotherapy.
