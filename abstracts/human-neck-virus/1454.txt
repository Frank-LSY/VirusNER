BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MCPyV in
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) primaries versus lymph node metastasis and to
evaluate possible prognostic factors.
METHODS: Samples of MCC primaries and lymph node metastases were stained
immunohistochemically for the MCPyV large T-antigen and expression was compared
to patientsÂ´ clinical outcome.
RESULTS: 41 MCC patients were included. 33 (61%) out of 54 specimens were
MCPyV-positive in the immunohistochemistry. 15 (47%) out of 32 primary tumors
were positive compared to 18 (82%) out of 22 lymph node metastases. Eleven
patients with positive polyomavirus expression died from the carcinoma compared
to 4 patients without virus expression. Cox regression analysis showed worse
disease-free survival in patients with MCPyV compared to virus-negative lymph
nodes (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study to describe a negative
prognostic effect of the MCPyV expression in lymph node metastasis in MCC
patients.
