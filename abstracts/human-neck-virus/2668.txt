Salivary gland disorders include inflammatory, bacterial, viral, and neoplastic
etiologies. The presentation can be acute, recurrent, or chronic. Acute
suppurative sialadenitis presents as rapid-onset pain and swelling and is treated
with antibiotics, salivary massage, hydration, and sialagogues such as lemon
drops or vitamin C lozenges. Viral etiologies include mumps and human
immunodeficiency virus, and treatment is directed at the underlying disease.
Recurrent or chronic sialadenitis is more likely to be inflammatory than
infectious; examples include recurrent parotitis of childhood and sialolithiasis.
Inflammation is commonly caused by an obstruction such as a stone or duct
stricture. Management is directed at relieving the obstruction. Benign and
malignant tumors can occur in the salivary glands and usually present as a
painless solitary neck mass. Diagnosis is made by imaging (e.g., ultrasonography,
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and biopsy (initially with
fine-needle aspiration). Overall, most salivary gland tumors are benign and can
be treated with surgical excision.
