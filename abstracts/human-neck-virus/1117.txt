PURPOSE: Retropharyngeal adenopathy (RPA) is poor prognostic factor in head and
neck (HN) cancer. However, the prognostic significance of RPA in Human
Papillomavirus-related (HPV+) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 185 patients with HPV+OPC were assessed. Pre-therapy images
reviewed by a HN radiologist to determine presence of RPA. Doses to the RPAs were
determined from treatment plans. Outcomes analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method,
log-rank tests, and correlations determined using Spearman's rank analyses.
RESULTS: 29 (16%) of the HPV+patients had RPA. At median follow-up 49months,
5-year overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS) and distant
failure-free survival (DFFS) were 57% vs. 81% (P=0.02), 63% vs 80% (P=0.015) and 
70% vs 91% (P=0.002) for patients with/without RPA, respectively. No differences 
observed in local/ regional control rates, exceeding 90% in both groups, and No
RPA recurrences were observed. In multivariable analysis, stages T4 or N3, and
RPA, were independently, statistically significantly associated with both OS and 
distant failure, while N2c, age, disease site, and smoking status, were not.
CONCLUSION: RPA in HPV+OPC is an independent prognostic factor for distant
failure, translating into worse OS. Patients with RPA may not be suitable
candidates for trials of systemic treatment de-escalation.
