BACKGROUND: There is no study reporting the influence of the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection on the biomarkers of gastric function like pepsinogen (PG) I and 
II in patients with gastric cancer, and the relationship between the infection of
EBV and Helicobacter pylori (HP) is unclear. This study focused on these issues.
METHODS: In this study, we detected the serum levels of PGI, PGII, anti-HP
(immunoglobulin G) IgG antibodies and EBV DNA load in a total of 189 gastric
cancer patients confirmed to be EBV positive or negative in tissue using in situ 
hybridization of EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs).
RESULTS: Compared to 123 EBV negative gastric cancer patients, the 66 patients
infected with EBV exhibited significant higher levels of PGI and PGI/II ratio and
meanwhile, had remarkably lower levels of anti-HP IgG. The prevalence of HP
infection in EBV positive patients was 13.6%, and 52.8% in EBV negative patients.
In subsequent analysis concerning the EBV DNA load, the patients were divided
into two groups by a cutoff value of 1000 copies/ml. The EBV DNA load showed
highly consistent association with PGI, PGI/II ratio and HP.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV infection in situ increased the serum levels of PGI and ratio of
PGI/PGII in gastric cancer patients. Moreover, the EBV infection exclusively
exists with HP infection in the patients with gastric cancer.
