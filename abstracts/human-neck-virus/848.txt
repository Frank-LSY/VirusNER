Influenza A virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It is an enveloped
virus that contains a segmented and negative-sense RNA genome. Influenza A
viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional major pandemics, are a major cause 
of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and have a significant financial impact on 
society. Assembly and budding of new viral particles are a complex and multi-step
process involving several host and viral factors. Influenza viruses use lipid
raft domains in the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells as sites
of budding. Two viral glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase,
concentrate in lipid rafts, causing alterations in membrane curvature and
initiation of the budding process. Matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms the inner
structure of the virion, is then recruited to the site followed by incorporation 
of the viral ribonucleoproteins and matrix protein 2 (M2). M1 can alter membrane 
curvature and progress budding, whereas lipid raft-associated M2 stabilizes the
site of budding, allowing for proper assembly of the virion. In the later stages 
of budding, M2 is localized to the neck of the budding virion at the lipid phase 
boundary, where it causes negative membrane curvature, leading to scission and
virion release.
