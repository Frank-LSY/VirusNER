We have identified a signature composed of 224 genes, which discriminates HPV16-induced OPSCC from their HPV-negative counterparts. After the blind classification of the 14 tumours, the viral status was revealed: 13 out of 14 tumors were correctly classified according to tumor etiology, 1/14 was not determined and none were misclassified. Several of the differentially expressed genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication and repair, transcription regulation, immune response and apoptosis.
