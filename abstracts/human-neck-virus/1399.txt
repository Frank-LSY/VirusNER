OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the prevalence of human papillomavirus
(HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and compared patient 
profiles and outcomes between HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study included all patients treated for OPSCC in
the University Hospitals of Leuven between 2004 and 2012. Paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue was available for all patients. Patient characteristics, treatment, and
follow-up data were retrieved from medical files. HPV status was determined by
immunohistochemical staining for the p16 epitope.
RESULTS: Among 94 patients, the prevalence of HPV-positive OPSCC was 22.34%.
Compared with HPV-negative tumors, HPV-positive tumors were correlated with less 
smoking and alcohol consumption, tonsillar sublocalization (P < .05), and younger
age. HPV-positive OPSCC was associated with better overall survival (62.2%)
compared with HPV-negative OPSCC (42.5%; P = .0588).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with OPSCC, those with HPV exhibited profiles
different from those without HPV. HPV-positive OPSCC was associated with better
overall survival compared with HPV-negative OPSCC. HPV-positive OPSCC prevalence 
increased over time.
