Mosquitoes are vectors of devastating pathogens and parasites, causing millions
of deaths every year. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in
tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Recently, dengue transmission 
has strongly increased in urban and semiurban areas, becoming a major
international public health concern. Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) is a
primary vector of dengue. Shedding light on genetic deviation in A. aegypti
populations is of crucial importance to fully understand their molecular ecology 
and evolution. In this research, haplotype and genetic analyses were conducted
using individuals of A. aegypti from 31 localities in the north, southeast,
northeast and central regions of Tamil Nadu (South India). The mitochondrial DNA 
region of cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene was used as marker for the analyses. 
Thirty-one haplotypes sequences were submitted to GenBank and authenticated. The 
complete haplotype set included 64 haplotypes from various geographical regions
clustered into three groups (lineages) separated by three fixed mutational steps,
suggesting that the South Indian Ae. aegypti populations were pooled and are
linked with West Africa, Columbian and Southeast Asian lineages. The genetic and 
haplotype diversity was low, indicating reduced gene flow among close populations
of the vector, due to geographical barriers such as water bodies. Lastly, the
negative values for neutrality tests indicated a bottle-neck effect and supported
for low frequency of polymorphism among the haplotypes. Overall, our results add 
basic knowledge to molecular ecology of the dengue vector A. aegypti, providing
the first evidence for multiple introductions of Ae. aegypti populations from
Columbia and West Africa in South India.
