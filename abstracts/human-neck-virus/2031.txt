PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays an important role in 
inflammation and immune responses, which control the human papillomavirus (HPV)
clearance and escape of immune surveillance, and may contribute to genetic
susceptibility to HPV16 infection.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this case series study, we analyzed the HPV16 status in
tumor specimens and genotyped three TGF-beta1 polymorphisms using genomic DNA
from the blood of 200 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) cases. We
calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in univariate
and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association between
the TGF-beta1 polymorphisms and HPV16 status in SCCOP.
RESULTS: Compared with those with the common homozygous genotype, the TGF-beta1
T869C variant genotypes were significantly associated with HPV16-positive tumor
status among patients with SCCOP (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.03-3.76), but no
significant association was observed for the TGF-beta1 C509T or G915C
polymorphism. When all variant genotypes were combined, however, SCCOP patients
carrying genotypes with any of these TGF-beta1 variants were more than twice as
likely to have an HPV16-positive tumor (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.16-4.50) as patients 
with no variant genotypes. The stratified analysis showed that those under 54
years of age, non-Hispanic white patients, never smokers, and never drinkers with
any variant TGF-beta1 genotypes were also more likely to have HPV16-positive
tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: TGF-beta1 polymorphisms may serve as a susceptibility marker for
tumor HPV16 status among SCCOP patients, particularly those who were never
smokers and never drinkers. Large studies are needed to validate our findings.
