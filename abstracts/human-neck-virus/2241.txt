OBJECTIVE: Congenital Cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is a well-defined cause for neonatal
mortality and morbidity, particularly sensorineural hearing loss and other
neurodevelopmental disruption. We present a retrospective study which provides an
overview of the assessment and preoperative work-up for patients diagnosed with
cCMV and their cochlear implant (CI) outcomes.
METHOD: This was a retrospective case series study of all children with a
confirmed diagnosis of cCMV who underwent cochlear implantation at St Thomas'
Hospital from 2003 to 2015. Data were collected on the preoperative audiology,
imaging findings, and neurological assessment. CI outcomes were measured using
the Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR), Category of Auditory Performance (CAP), 
and Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS).
RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent cochlear implantation, 45% had
severe-to-profound hearing loss, and 55% had bilateral profound hearing loss. The
mean age at initial assessment was 2.1 years (median 1.7, range 0.6-7.5) and the 
mean age of implantation was 4.0 years (median 2.5, range 0.9-11.8). The mean
length of follow-up was 4.8 years (median 2.3, range 1.5-14). Six patients had
bilateral simultaneous implantation (55%), four bilateral sequential (36%), and
one unilateral (9%). Nine patients had white matter changes on magnetic resonance
imaging, largely in the periventricular and cortical regions. Of the 11 patients,
4 (36%) had associated neurological comorbidities and 3 (27%) had additional
neurocognitive developmental delay of varying severity. The majority of patients 
showed improvement in auditory outcomes. No statistically significant correlation
was found between age of implantation, neurocognitive, and neurological
comorbidities or length of follow-up and hearing outcomes.
CONCLUSION: While the overall outcomes were mixed, most children in our cohort
were found to benefit from cochlear implantation. Our data also highlight the
significant neurodevelopmental comorbidities associated with cCMV and their
negative impact on CI outcomes. With the recent advances in medical treatment,
this underlines the importance of multidisciplinary management of these patients.
