BACKGROUND: To report a single institutional experience with definitive radiation
therapy alone for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck cancer.
METHODS: A total of 67 patients were treated by radiation therapy alone to a
median dose of 70 Gy (range, 66-72 Gy) for squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed pretreatment tumor tissues were used 
to establish HPV-positivity using standardized techniques of immunohistochemistry
for p16 and polymerase chain reaction for HPV.
RESULTS: In all, 23 patients with HPV-positive cancers were identified. With a
median follow-up of 28 months (range, 6-85 months), the 3-year actuarial rates of
overall survival, locoregional control, and distant metastasis-free survival were
83%, 90%, and 88%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: These findings attest to the exquisite radiosensitivity of
HPV-positive head and neck cancer. The clinical outcomes observed from this
selected series compare favorably with historical controls treated by more
intensive chemoradiotherapy strategies.
