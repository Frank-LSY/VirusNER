INTRODUCTION: A survey was conducted to assess the level of knowledge on oral
cancer among different medical fields, in particular about diagnostic items and
risk factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to physicians 
from various fields, such as otorhinolaryngology, general practice, internal
medicine, and dermatology.
RESULTS: 388 of the 2,952 questionnaires were returned (13.1%), subdivided into
otorhinolaryngology (n = 33), internal medicine (n = 135), dermatology (n = 28), 
and general practice (n = 192). The average knowledge of risk factors was similar
in the specialisations, ranging from 68% for internal medicine to 76% for
otorhinolaryngology and 77% for dermatology. The three main risk factors: tobacco
(93%-100%), alcohol (79%-100%), and prior oral cancer lesions (91%-100%) were the
most commonly known. Regarding the diagnostic items, the average percentage of
correct answers ranged from 69% for internal and general medicine to 77% for
dermatologists. Continuous courses of education and the year of graduation were
the only two variables that significantly related to a better level of knowledge 
of risk factors and diagnostic items.
CONCLUSIONS: The average knowledge among the different medical fields was
satisfying. These results demonstrated a robust base for all healthcare providers
to continue working together to improve the early detection of oral cancer.
