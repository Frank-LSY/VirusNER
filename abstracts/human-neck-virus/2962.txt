OBJECTIVE: Some epidemiological evidence, particularly concerning the role of
Epstein Barr Virus implies that multiple sclerosis (MS) may be transmissible and 
if correct, this might be revealed by increased prevalence of MS in cohabiting
partners.
METHODS: We addressed this problem by neurological assessment, visual-evoked
potentials (VEP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 112 partners of patients
with MS in comparison to a control group of 93 individuals with clinically
non-significant head or neck pain and in comparison to UK prevalence.
RESULTS: We found one instance of conjugal definite MS. Including this case, VEP 
were abnormal in five instances with either significant delay (n = 3) or
increased interocular latency difference (IOLD) (n = 2) in partners of MS
patients thus raising the possibility of subclinical optic nerve demyelination.
The mean absolute value of IOLD in partners was greater than the value in
controls (P = 0.033). There were no significant differences in MRI findings
between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The finding of one conjugal pair and abnormal VEP in a further four
MS partners could have several explanations. It is compatible with the concept of
a transmissible agent, although our observations could be due to several biases
as well as the play of chance alone.
