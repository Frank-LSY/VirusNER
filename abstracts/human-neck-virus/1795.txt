The mammalian inner ear consists of diverse cell types with important functions. 
Gene mutations in these diverse cell types have been found to underlie different 
forms of genetic hearing loss. Targeting these mutations for gene therapy
development represents a future therapeutic strategy to treat hearing loss.
Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have become the vector of choice for gene
delivery in animal models in vivo. To identify AAV vectors that target inner ear 
cell subtypes, we systemically screened 12 AAV vectors with different serotypes
(AAV1, 2, 5, 6, 6.2, 7, 8, 9, rh.8, rh.10, rh.39, and rh.43) that carry a
reporter gene GFP in neonatal and adult mice by microinjection in vivo. We found 
that most AAVs infect both neonatal and adult inner ear, with different
specificities and expression levels. The inner ear cochlear sensory epithelial
region, which includes auditory hair cells and supporting cells, is most
frequently targeted for gene delivery. Expression of the transgene is sustained, 
and neonatal inner ear delivery does not adversely affect hearing. Adult inner
ear injection of AAV has a similar infection pattern as the younger inner ear,
with the exception that outer hair cell death caused by the injection procedure
can lead to hearing loss. In the adult, more so than in the neonatal mice, cell
types infected and efficiency of infection are correlated with the site of
injection. Most infected cells survive in neonatal and adult inner ears. The
study adds to the list of AAV vectors that transduce the mammalian inner ear
efficiently, providing the tools that are important to study inner ear gene
function and for the development of gene therapy to treat hearing loss.
