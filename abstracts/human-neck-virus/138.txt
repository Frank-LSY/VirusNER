The viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) of influenza A virus is formed by virion RNA
(vRNA), viral polymerase complex, and nucleoprotein (NP). The NP plays an
important role in facilitating the replication and stabilization of viral RNA. To
explore host factors that may be involved in the regulation of viral replication 
through interactions with NP, we conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment
followed by mass spectrometry to identify NP-associated cellular proteins. Here, 
we demonstrate that NP can interact and colocalize with heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 in mammalian cells and that the interaction may
occur via direct binding to the glycine-rich domain (GRD) of hnRNP A2/B1. In
addition, two residues in the tail loop of NP, F412 and R422, are required for
the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1. Because the knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 expression
reduces viral RNP activity, hnRNP A2/B1 may act as a positive regulator in viral 
RNA synthesis of influenza A virus. More importantly, the findings in this
research demonstrate that host proteins can regulate the replication of influenza
A virus by interacting with NP.
