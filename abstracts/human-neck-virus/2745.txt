Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the skin is a rare malignant
epithelial neoplasm, which shows histological resemblance of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (Schmincke-Regaud tumor). Similar tumors have been reported at a
variety of sites, including salivary gland, tonsil, thymus, stomach, and uterus. 
Extracutaneous LELC shows frequently an association with Epstein-Barr virus,
whereas Epstein-Barr virus in LELC of the skin has been described only once till 
now. LELC of the skin usually presents as a papulonodular lesion on the head or
neck of patients above 50 years of age. Here, we describe a collision tumor with 
an LELC and a marginal zone lymphoma of the skin in a 75-year-old female patient.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an association between these
2 malignancies, and the possibility of a causal relationship is discussed.
