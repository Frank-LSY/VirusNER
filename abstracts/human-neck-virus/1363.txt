Head neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are a significant cause of morbidity 
and mortality all around the world. Just like tobacco and alcohol, Human
papilloma virus (HPV) infection is now recognized to play a role in the
pathogenesis of a subset of HNSCCs. Unprotected sexual behaviours with the HPV
carrier plays an important role in transmission of this virus. The global
incidence of head and neck cancers is declining, but the incidence of HPV related
head and neck cancers is rapidly increasing over the last few decades. However,
most institutions do not mandate documentation of sexual history or counselling
of patients regarding sexual practices like they do for tobacco and alcohol
addictions in HNSCC patients. The aim of this review of literature is to analyse 
if there is a strong evidence to correlate oral sex with HPV related HNSCC and
counsel the patient's regarding sexual behaviours.
