PURPOSE: Oropharyngeal carcinoma positive for human papillomavirus type 16
(HPV16) has a significantly better prognosis than oropharyngeal carcinoma
unrelated to HPV. Within HPV16-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma, biomarkers of
prognosis are urgently needed to individualize care. We hypothesized that serum
antibodies specific to HPV16, the major HPV type causing oropharyngeal carcinoma,
have biologic relevance and are potential biomarkers for improved prognosis among
patients with HPV16-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: IgG antibodies to the HPV16 antigens E1, E4-E7, L1, L2, and 
the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of E2 (NE2, CE2) were quantified using a 
custom programmable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sera were obtained at
diagnosis from 209 oropharyngeal carcinoma patients (96 HPV16-positive). The
ratios of median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each antigen to MFI for control 
GST protein were determined. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional
hazards regression were used to determine survival differences between groups.
ROC curves were used to determine the best combination of E antibodies to predict
disease recurrence.
RESULTS: E1, NE2, and E6 antibody positivity were all strongly associated with
improved overall and progression-free survival in the entire cohort and in
patients with known HPV16-positive tumors (P < 0.05). For both overall and
progression-free survival among HPV-positive patients, hazard ratios were 0.2 for
NE2, 0.3 for E1, and 0.3 for E6 antibody positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified three HPV16-specific antibodies that are associated
with improved overall and progression-free survival in patients with HPV-related 
oropharyngeal carcinoma. These results suggest that differential serologic
responses in patients may reflect differential biologic processes within the host
and tumor and may have prognostic value.
