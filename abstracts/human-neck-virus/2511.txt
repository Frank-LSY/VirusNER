Tuberculosis (TB) remains a real public health concern in Africa; thyroid
localisation of the disease is a very rare form of extrapulmonary TB. We
conducted a descriptive and cross-sectional study on all histologically proved
cases of thyroid TB diagnosed in Togo over the last 20 years. Eleven cases of TB 
of the thyroid were identified, of which nine were in women, with an average age 
of 29.4 ± 0.2 years. The clinical signs were the presence of a nodule in seven,
an abscess in three and a swelling with cutaneous fistulisation in one. Thyroid
involvement alone was found in four, associated with pleuropulmonary TB in six
and mammary TB in one. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection was
present in six. All histopathology results showed inflammatory granulomata with
caseous necrosis. The clinical features are often misleading and pose a real
diagnostic problem, especially with differentials of simple abscess and cancer.
