BACKGROUND: In the absence of clear evidence on the efficacy of concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over conventional radiotherapy (RT) for HPV+ve and for
HPV-ve oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), this study compares the treatments and
outcomes from pre-CRT years to post-CRT years.
METHODS: A population-based retrospective treatment-effectiveness study based on 
all patients with OPC treated in Ontario Canada in 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2004.
Charts were reviewed, tissue samples were requested and tissue was tested for p16
or in situ hybridisation. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival
(DSS) were compared by treatment era and by treatment type for all 1028 patients,
for 865 treated for cure and for 610 with HPV status.
RESULTS: There was no improvement in OS comparing pre-CRT to post-CRT eras for
the HPV+ve patients (P=0.147) or for the HPV-ve patients (P=0.362). There was no 
difference in OS comparing CRT to RT for the HPV+ve cohort (HR=0.948
(0.642-1.400)) or for the HPV-ve patients (HR=1.083 (0.68-1.727)).
CONCLUSIONS: In these 'real-world' patients what appeared to be improvements in
OS with CRT in clinical trials were confounded by HPV status in Ontario. CRT did 
not improve outcomes for HPV+ve or for HPV-ve patients.
