OBJECTIVE: To assess for the presence of human herpesvirus (HHV) using
immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in surgically
excised vestibular schwannoma (VS) samples.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: A retrospective laboratory-based study of tumors from patients with
vestibular schwannoma.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) representing sporadic and
NF2-associated VS from 121 patients, as well as appropriate positive and negative
controls, were studied. TMA sections were immunostained using antibodies directed
against HHV-1, HHV-2, HHV-3, HHV-4, HHV-5, and HHV-8. PCR was used for the
detection of all 8 known human herpesviruses.
RESULTS: There was no detectable HHV (HHV-1, HHV-2, HHV-3, HHV-4, HHV-5, HHV-8)
by immunohistochemistry in any of the 121 cases of sporadic and NF2 cases
analyzed. These data were further validated by DNA sequence analyses using PCR in
a subset of the VS samples, all of which were found to be negative for all HHV.
CONCLUSIONS: The data offer no support for an association between HHV and the
development of sporadic or NF2-associated VS in humans.
