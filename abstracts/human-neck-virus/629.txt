In September 2015, a Wyoming woman was admitted to a local hospital with a 5-day 
history of progressive weakness, ataxia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Because of
respiratory failure, she was transferred to a referral hospital in Utah, where
she developed progressive encephalitis. On day 8 of hospitalization, the
patient's family told clinicians they recalled that, 1 month before admission,
the woman had found a bat on her neck upon waking, but had not sought medical
care. The patient's husband subsequently had contacted county invasive species
authorities about the incident, but he was not advised to seek health care for
evaluation of his wife's risk for rabies. On October 2, CDC confirmed the patient
was infected with a rabies virus variant that was enzootic to the silver-haired
bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). The patient died on October 3. Public
understanding of rabies risk from bat contact needs to be improved; cooperation
among public health and other agencies can aid in referring persons with possible
bat exposure for assessment of rabies risk.
