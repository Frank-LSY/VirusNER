Rugby Union (rugby) is a sport that evolved from and resembles other forms of
football but is unique in many respects and presents distinctive clinical
challenges. This article discusses those aspects of rugby that are different from
other sports and those injuries that have specific significance to the game as a 
result of it being a global collision sport with an increasing focus on serious
injury prevention. Injury screening and intervention programs, neck injuries,
rugby's contribution to evolving concussion protocols, contact and travel-related
illnesses, and rugby's drug intervention protocols are discussed.
