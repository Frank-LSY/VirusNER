BACKGROUND: This study investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for oral
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with multiple genotypes in the United
States.
METHODS: Data were from the nationally representative 2009-2012 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey. This analysis comprised 9257 participants for
whom data on oral HPV (37 genotypes) and associated risk factors were available.
RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of multitype (2-6 types) oral HPV infection was 
1.5% (2.5% for men, 0.4% for women) in the whole sample and 19.7% (22.0% for men,
12.1% for women) in those who had any type of oral HPV positivity. Most multitype
oral HPV cases (83.8%) harbored one or more oncogenic types. In the adjusted
multinominal logistic regression model, being male (relative risk ratio [RRR] =
3.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-8.65), being a current cigarette smoker 
(RRR = 2.57; 95% CI, 1.23-5.36), and having a new sex partner in the past year
(RRR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.03-4.28) were associated with an increased risk of
multitype oral HPV infection over single-type HPV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Men, smokers, and those who had new sexual partners were at a
significantly higher risk for multitype oral HPV infection.
