BACKGROUND: This study investigated prospectively the role of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in paranasal inverted papilloma (IP).
METHODS: HPV presence and viral load and physical status of HPV-16 were examined 
by polymerase chain reaction-based methods using fresh frozen samples obtained
from 13 patients with IP (IP group), 11 with squamous cell carcinoma in the
maxillary sinus (SCC group) and 39 with chronic inflammatory lesions
(inflammatory group).
RESULTS: The presence of the HPV genome was detected in 46.1%, 27.3% and 7.6% of 
patients in the IP, SCC and inflammatory groups, respectively. The IP group
showed significantly higher HPV-positive rates than the inflammatory group. All
types of HPV detected were high-risk HPV, especially HPV-16. The relative HPV-16 
copy numbers varied from 2.5 to 1524.1 per 50 ng genomic DNA. The viral load was 
higher in the IP and SCC groups than in the inflammatory group. In the IP group, 
no significant relationship was found between HPV-16 viral load and clinical
characteristics, or between physical status and clinical characteristics. One
patient with IP and concomitant squamous cell carcinoma, however, showed high
viral load and integration.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection is involved in the pathogenesis of IP, and high viral 
load and integration of HPV have an important role in malignant lesion in
association with IP.
