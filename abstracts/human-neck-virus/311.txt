When the Kampo medicine, Hochuekkito (Hochu), was administered to normal mice for
2 weeks, influenza virus titer was reduced. The mechanism of action of Hochu was 
examined using the plaque assay method. It was suggested that Hochu may either
obstruct the first stage of the infection process (adsorption and entry) or may
directly target viral particles. Using the plaque assay method, these 2 modes of 
action could not be differentiated. Virus RNA in the infected cell was verified
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. An equal inhibition effect
was obtained when Hochu was preprocessed for normal cells and when they were made
to act simultaneously with virus adsorption. The viral load at the cell surface
following UV irradiation was higher in the Hochu-administered group as compared
with that of the control. Moreover, the affinity of Hochu for the influenza virus
was hundred times higher than its affinity for the host cell. The effect of entry
obstruction by Hochu was observed via image analysis, where the amount of virus
nucleocapsid protein (NP) invading the cell was visualized with FITC-labeled NP
antibody. Hochu does not seem to have an effect on nucleic acid synthesis, viral 
release from infected cells, and on the subsequent second round of infection. In 
conclusion, Hochu binds to viral particles and forms complexes that can obstruct 
the entry of influenza virus into cells.
