Iatrogenic complications associated with current treatment protocols for
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are noted to cause high rates of acute and 
chronic morbidity. The aims of this study are to provide an overview of the
current de-escalation trials for human papillomavirus positive (HPV+)
oropharyngeal carcinoma and to evaluate the evidence supporting improved response
to treatment of patients within this viral cohort. This study reviewed all
completed or in progress randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing clinical
interventions for human papillomavirus-associated locally advanced oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma. We utilised a validated 'risk of bias' tool to assess
study quality. We identified nine RCTs that met the full inclusion criteria for
this review (all of which are currently on-going and will report from 2015
onwards). Five RCTs performed a post hoc analysis by HPV status, which allowed
meta-analysis of 1130 patients. The data reveal a significant difference in
overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI)
0.35-0.69]), loco-regional failure (HR 0.43 [95% CI 0.17-1.11]) and disease
specific survival (0.41 [95% 0.3-0.56]) in favour of the HPV+ category. In
considering de-escalation treatment protocols, nine studies are currently
ongoing. Our meta-analysis provides strong evidence for an improved prognosis in 
the viral associated cohort when treated by platinum based chemotherapy in
combination with radiotherapy or primary radiotherapy. So far, one trial (with
moderate to high risk of bias) suggests a reduced survival outcome for the HPV+
population when using the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor
cetuximab.
