Recent data demonstrate that human papillomavirus also plays a role in cancers
other than ano-genital cancers, specifically head and neck cancers, and
non-cancerous conditions such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. As more
and more information about the role of infection in non-cervical diseases is
amassed, additional questions about whether prophylactic human papillomavirus
vaccines will effectively prevent these conditions are raised. This article
reviews the epidemiology of oral human papillomavirus infection and the role of
human papillomavirus in head and neck cancers. In addition, it will review the
known clinical indications for human papillomavirus vaccination, and highlight
other potential clinical targets for the vaccine that have not yet been
demonstrated in clinical trials but for which there is biologic plausibility.
