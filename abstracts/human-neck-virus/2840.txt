Virus-associated malignancies and sarcomatoid cancers correlate with high PD-L1
expression, however, underlying mechanisms remain controversial. We evaluated the
correlation between PD-L1 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).Tumor tissues from 50 patients 
with HNSCC were evaluated for PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry, which showed 32
(64.0%) were PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+). Interestingly, PD-L1 expression was
significantly associated with EMT (P = 0.010), as assessed by low E-cadherin and 
high vimentin expression. The overall survival of PD-L1+ patients with EMT
features was significantly worse than those without EMT features (P = 0.007). In 
an independent validation cohort (N = 91), as well as in HNSCC cases of The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, high PD-L1
expression was also associated with the high probability of an EMT signature,
referred from the GEO dataset, GSE4824. Survival analysis confirmed PD-L1+/EMT+
patients had a poorer prognosis than PD-L1+/EMT- patients in the TCGA cohort.
PD-L1 positivity can thus be divided into two categories according to the absence
or presence of EMT. PD-L1 expression is also independently associated with EMT
features in HNSCC.
