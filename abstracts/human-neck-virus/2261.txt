BACKGROUND: The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in oropharyngeal
squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) tissue appears to be a strong predictor of improved 
prognosis, but this observation has not been explored in a population-based
sample with generalisable findings.
METHODS: Follow-up data from a large sample of OPSCC patients identified through 
six population-based cancer registries in the United States of America (USA) were
used to characterise the association of tumour HPV status with survival.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in tumour tissue from 71% (378 in 529) of the OPSCC
patients. A total of 65% of patients with HPV16-associated tumours survived 5
years compared to 46% of patients with other HPV types and 28% of patients with
HPV-negative tumours (p log-rank test <0.0001). The OPSCC patients with
detectable HPV16 DNA had a 62% reduced hazard of death at 5 years, and patients
with other HPV types had a 42% reduced hazard of death at 5 years compared to
HPV-negative patients. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks with OPSCC had a
2.6-fold greater risk of death at 5 years after adjustment for HPV status and
other prognostic variables. Both surgery and radiation therapy were associated
with a reduced 5-year risk of death, but no evidence was found for an interaction
between HPV status and radiotherapy or surgery on survival time.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this US study suggest that HPV16-positive OPSCC patients
survive longer than HPV-negative patients regardless of treatment, highlighting
the prognostic importance of HPV status for this malignancy. Optimal treatment
regimens for OPSCC could be tailored to each patient's HPV status and prognostic 
profile.
