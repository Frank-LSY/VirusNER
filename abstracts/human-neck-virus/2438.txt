BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evaluate the prognostic and predictive impact of
HPV-associated p16-expression and assess the combined prognostic impact of p16
and smoking on altered fractionated radiotherapy (AFRT) for oropharyngeal cancer 
(OPC) within the frames of the update of the Meta-Analysis of Radiotherapy in
Carcinomas of Head and neck (MARCH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with OPC, known tumor p16-status and smoking
history were identified from the MARCH update, resulting in a dataset of 815
patients from four randomized trials (RTOG9003, DAHANCA6&7, RTOG0129, ARTSCAN).
Analysis was performed using a Cox model stratified by trial and adjusted on
gender, age, T-stage, N-stage, type of radiotherapy fractionation, p16, smoking. 
Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: In total, 465 patients (57%) had p16-positive tumors and 350 (43%)
p16-negative. Compared to p16-negative, p16-positive patients had significantly
better PFS (HR = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.34-0.51], 28.9% absolute increase at 10 years)
and OS (HR = 0.40 [0.32-0.49], 32.1% absolute increase at 10 years). No
interaction between p16-status and fractionation schedule was detected. Smoking
negatively impacted outcome; in the p16-positive subgroup, never smokers had
significantly better PFS than former/current smokers (HR = 0.49 [0.33-0.75],
24.2% survival benefit at 10 years).
CONCLUSIONS: No predictive impact of p16-status on response to AFRT could be
detected but the strong prognostic impact of p16-status was confirmed and
especially p16-positive never smoking patients have superior outcome after RT.
