The distribution of the neurotropic alphaherpesviruses-herpes simplex virus type 
1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV)-was determined in
autonomic and sensory ganglia of the head and neck obtained from formalin-fixed
human cadavers. HSV-1 and VZV DNA were found in 18 of 58 and 16 of 58 trigeminal,
23 of 58 and 11 of 58 pterygopalatine, 25 of 60 and 14 of 60 ciliary, 25 of 48
and 11 of 48 geniculate, 15 of 50 and 8 of 50 otic, 14 of 47 and 4 of 47
submandibular, 18 of 58 and 10 of 58 superior cervical, and 12 of 36 and 1 of 36 
nodose ganglia, respectively. HSV-2 was not detected at any site. Viral DNA
positivity and location were independently distributed among autonomic and
sensory ganglia of the human head and neck.
