OBJECTIVES: In recent years, the incidence of Human Papilloma Virus
(HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has markedly
increased. Our aim was to design a novel therapeutic agent through the use of
conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) that are targeted to the HPV E6
and E7 oncoproteins.
METHODS: Each adenovirus included small deletion(s) in the E1a region of the
genome (Δ24 or CB016) intended to allow for selective replication in HPV-positive
cells. In vitro assays were performed to analyze the transduction efficiency of
the vectors and the cell viability following viral infection. Then, the UPCI
SCC090 cell line (HPV-positive) was used to establish subcutaneous tumors in the 
flanks of nude mice. The tumors were then treated with either one dose of the
virus or four doses (injected every fourth day).
RESULTS: The transduction analysis with luciferase-expressing viruses
demonstrated that the 5/3 fiber modification maximized virus infectivity. In
vitro, both viruses (5/3Δ24 and 5/3CB016) demonstrated profound oncolytic
effects. The 5/3CB016 virus was more selective for HPV-positive HNSCC cells,
whereas the 5/3Δ24 virus killed HNSCC cells regardless of HPV status. In vivo,
single injections of both viruses demonstrated anti-tumor effects for only a few 
days following viral inoculation. However, after four viral injections, there was
statistically significant reductions in tumor growth when compared to the control
group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: CRAds targeted to HPV-positive HNSCCs demonstrated excellent in vitro
and in vivo therapeutic effects, and they have the potential to be clinically
translated as a novel treatment modality for this emerging disease.
