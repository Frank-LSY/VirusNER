Sexually transmitted oral cancer/head and neck cancer is increasing rapidly.
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is playing a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of 
squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Paclitaxel is a widely used
anticancer drug for breast, ovarian, testicular, cervical, non-small cell lung,
head and neck cancer. However, it is water insoluble and orally inactive. We
report the synthesis of water soluble nanosize conjugates of paclitaxel, branched
PEG, and EGFR-targeting peptide by employing native chemical ligation. We
performed a native chemical ligation between the N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS)
ester of paclitaxel succinate and cysteine at pH 6.5 to give the
cysteine-conjugated paclitaxel derivative. The thiol functionality of cysteine
was activated and subsequently conjugated to multiarm thiol-PEG to obtain the
paclitaxel branched PEG conjugate. Finally, we conjugated an EGFR-targeting
peptide to obtain conjugates of paclitaxel, branched PEG, and EGFR-targeting
peptide. These conjugates show anticancer activity against squamous cell
carcinoma of head and neck cells (SCCHN, Tu212).
