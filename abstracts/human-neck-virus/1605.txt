OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to validate the applicability of new TNM 
classification for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) 
in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for
International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging system in Japan.
METHODS: A total of 91 OPC patients treated with radiation-based therapy between 
November 2001 and July 2015 were analyzed retrospectively in this study. HPV
infection status was evaluated using tumor p16 expression.
RESULTS: 40 OPC patients (44.0%) had HPV-positive disease in this study. The
distribution of disease stage of HPV-positive OPC patients dramatically changed
from the 7th edition to the 8th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM classification. However,
neither the 8th edition nor the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system
could adequately predict outcomes of HPV-positive OPC patients in our patient
series. On the other hand, our multivariate analysis indicated that matted nodes 
and age ≥63 were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival. In
addition, HPV-positive OPC patients with stage I without matted nodes showed
significantly better overall and progression-free survival compared with those
with stage I with matted nodes and stages II and III in the 8th edition of the
AJCC/UICC TNM staging system (P=0.008, and P=0.043, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that matted nodes of HPV-positive OPC patients 
might be additionally examined to apply the 8th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM
classification for more adequate predicting outcomes of HPV-positive OPC
patients.
