Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTL) is a rare but highly
aggressive Epstein-Barr virus-related malignancy, which mainly occurs in
nasopharyngeal and nasal/paranasal areas. In addition to its high prevalence in
Asian, Central American and South American populations, its incidence rate has
been gradually increasing in Western countries. The current mainstay of treatment
is a combination of multiple chemotherapies and irradiation. Although
chemoradiotherapy can cure NKTL, it often causes severe and fatal adverse events.
Because a growing body of evidence suggests that immunotherapy is effective
against hematological malignancies, this treatment could provide an alternative
to chemoradiotherapy for treatment of NKTL. In this review, we focus on how
recent findings could be used to develop efficient immunotherapies against NKTL.
