BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence exists that tumor volume may be a superior
prognostic model than traditional TNM staging. It has been observed that
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oropharyngeal SCC) in the setting of human
papillomavirus (HPV) positivity have a greater propensity for cystic nodal
metastases, and, thus, presumably larger volume with relatively smaller primary
tumors. The influence of HPV status on the predictive value of tumor volume is
unknown.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC were treated
with definitive chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
RESULTS: The estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
(DFS) was 92.2% and 83.6%, respectively. Nodal classification did not predict OS 
(p = .096) or DFS (p = .170). Similarly, T classification did not predict OS
(p = .057) or DFS (p = .309). Lower nodal volume was associated with greater DFS 
(p = .001).
CONCLUSION: Nodal tumor volume was found to be predictive of DFS. DFS was best
predicted by nodal gross tumor volume (GTV) at 24 months. © 2015 Wiley
