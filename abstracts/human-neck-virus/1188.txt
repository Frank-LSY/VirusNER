Papillomaviruses are small DNA viruses that infect and multiply in cutaneous or
mucosal epithelial tissue. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 cause more than
99% of cervical carcinomas. Simultaneous presence of HPV is found in cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal and anal
cancer. Invasive vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in younger women under the age of
50 are also associated with HPV. Most of the penile lesions are subclinical and
the high prevalence of high-risk HPV suggests that they constitute a reservoir
for high-risk HPV. Bowens disease and Buschke-Lowenstein tumors are associated
with particular low- and high-risk HPV types. The potential role of HPV infection
in the carcinogenic steps of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers should
be further tested. HPV-DNA might be transported from the original site of
infection to the breast tissue by the bloodstream, and therefore is possibly
involved in the carcinogenesis of breast neoplasia in some patients. HPV-DNA is
detected in 40-70% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and in only 1% in
normal epithelial cells. In this paper we propose the hypothesis that many
epithelial normal cells are susceptible to HPV infection, which are the most
sexually transmitted viruses. Experimental and epidemiological data imply a
causative role for HPVs and they appear to be the second most important risk
factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco usage.
