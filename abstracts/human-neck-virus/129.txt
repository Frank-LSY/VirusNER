OBJECTIVE: Although Japan is a non-endemic area with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), the proportion of WHO type I NPC in Japan are different from that in
non-endemic areas such as North America and Europe. Recently, it is said that not
only Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but also human papillomavirus (HPV) has an
influence on NPC in non-endemic areas. The aim of this study is to clarify the
influence of HPV on NPC in Japan.
METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were available for 59 patients with
NPC diagnosed between 1996 and 2015. We detected the virus status by p16
immunohistochemistry, HPV PCR, and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-encoded RNA. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the overall survival 
by viral status.
RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 49 (83%) were EBV-positive/HPV-negative, 2 (3%)
were EBV-positive/HPV-positive, and 8 (16%) were EBV-negative/HPV-negative. All
HPV-positive NPCs were co-infected with EBV. There were no significant
differences between the overall survival in the three groups (p=0.111).
CONCLUSION: In Japan, HPV was detected in a few patients with NPC, and we suggest
that HPV has no influence on NPC carcinogenesis in this population.
