Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are stromal cells in secondary lymphoid
organs, the major sites for HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. Although FRCs
regulate T cell survival, proliferation, and migration, whether they play any
role in HIV-1 spread has not been studied. Here, we show that FRCs enhance HIV-1 
spread via trans-infection in which FRCs capture HIV-1 and facilitate infection
of T cells that come into contact with FRCs. FRCs mediate trans-infection in both
two- and three-dimensional culture systems and in a manner dependent on the virus
producer cells. This producer cell dependence, which was also observed for virus 
spread in secondary lymphoid tissues ex vivo, is accounted for by CD44
incorporated into virus particles and hyaluronan bound to such CD44 molecules.
This virus-associated hyaluronan interacts with CD44 expressed on FRCs, thereby
promoting virus capture by FRCs. Overall, our results reveal a novel role for
FRCs in promoting HIV-1 spread.
