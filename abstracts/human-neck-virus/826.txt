By multivariable analysis, high HPV 16 E7 viral load (≥15.0 copies/genome); high HPV 18 E7 viral load (≥15.0 copies/genome); pathological N2 status (pN2); tumor depth ≥11 mm; extracapsular spread (ECS); and level IV/V metastases were independent risk factors for DM. We further identified three prognostic groups. In the high-risk group (level IV/V metastases or high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load plus pN2, tumor depth ≥11 mm, or ECS), the 5-year distant metastasis rate was 74%. In the intermediate-risk group (high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load, pN2, tumor depth ≥11 mm, or ECS), the 5-year DM rate was 17%. Finally, the 5-year DM rate was 1% in the low-risk group (no risk factors). The value of the C statistics was 0.78.
