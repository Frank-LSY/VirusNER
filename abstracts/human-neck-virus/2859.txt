Cancer occurrence can be understood as the result of dysfunctions in immune
tumoral microenvironment. Here we review the recent understandings of those
microenvironment changes, regarding their causes and prognostic significance in
head and neck (HN) carcinoma. We will focus on HN squamous cell cancer (SCC) and 
nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC). Their overall poor prognosis may be improved
with immunotherapy in a subset of patients, as supported by current clinical
trials. However, finding reliable markers of therapeutic response is crucial for 
patient selection, due to potential severe adverse reactions and high costs. Half
of HNSCC exhibit PD-L1 expression, this expression being higher in HPV-positive
tumors. In recent clinical trials, a better therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 was
obtained in patients with higher PD-L1 expression. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved the use of these therapeutics without stating a
need for patient selection regarding PD-L1 status. Activation status, density and
localization of TIL as well as PD-L2, γ-interferon, inflammatory cytokines,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype and mutational burden may all be
potential therapeutic response markers. In Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-induced
nasopharyngeal non-keratinizing cancer, PD-L1 is over-expressed compared to
EBV-negative tumors. A 22% response rate has been observed under anti-PD-1
treatment among PD-L1-positive NPC patients. A better understanding of immune
checkpoint regulation processes may allow patients to benefit from these
promising immunotherapies.
