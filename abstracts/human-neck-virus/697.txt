Muscle-derived progenitor cell (myoblast) therapy has promise for the treatment
of denervated, weakened, and fibrotic muscle. The best methods for injecting
myoblasts to promote fusion and retention have yet to be determined, however.
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells have also been reported to have beneficial effects
in restoring damaged tissue, through increasing vascularization and reducing
inflammation. The interactions between human primary skeletal myoblasts and bone 
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells were examined using time-lapse
images put into video format. Of interest, there is a high degree of cell-to-cell
interaction with microparticles transferring between both cell types, and
formation of nanotubules to bridge cytoplasmic contents between the two types of 
cell. This model provides an in vitro platform for examining mechanisms for
cell-to-cell interaction preceding myoblast fusion.
