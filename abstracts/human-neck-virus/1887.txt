PURPOSE: A subset of head and neck cancers is associated with the human
papillomavirus (HPV). Viral infection is closely correlated with expression of
p16(INK4A) in these tumors. We evaluated p16(INK4A) as a prognostic marker of
treatment response and survival in a well-defined and prospectively collected
cohort of patients treated solely with conventional radiotherapy in the Danish
Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) 5 trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of p16(INK4A) was analyzed
in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from 156 patients treated with
conventional primary radiotherapy alone. The influence of p16(INK4A) status on
locoregional tumor control, disease-specific survival, and overall survival after
radiotherapy was evaluated.
RESULTS: p16(INK4A) positivity was found in 35 tumors (22%). Tumor-positivity for
p16(INK4A) was significantly correlated with improved locoregional tumor control 
(5-year actuarial values 58% v 28%; P = .0005), improved disease-specific
survival (72% v 34%; P = .0006), and improved overall survival (62% v 26%; P =
.0003). In multivariate analysis, p16(INK4A) remained a strong independent
prognostic factor for locoregional failure (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19
to 0.64), disease-specific death (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.64), and overall
death (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.68).
CONCLUSION: Expression of p16(INK4A) has a major impact on treatment response and
survival in patients with head and neck cancer treated with conventional
radiotherapy.
