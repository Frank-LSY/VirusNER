A 39-year-old Philipino man presented with acute onset fever and headache.
Neurological examination was normal except for neck stiffness. There was no
history of chest pain, cough or breathlessness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 
a mild increase in protein with normal sugar and lymphocytic pleocytosis. CSF PCR
for herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus was negative. He developed acute
right haemiplegia a week after hospitalisation. MRI showed acute infarct in the
left centrum semiovale. His angiogram showed aneurysm in the left subclavian
artery and aortic arch. The mycoplasma antibody test came positive with very high
titres, while rest of the workup was negative. He was treated with azithromycin
and his symptoms improved completely.He was asymptomatic on follow-up after a
month. His repeat immunoglobulin G mycoplasma antibody titre showed elevation.
Mycoplasma infection is a treatable cause of meningoencephalitis and stroke
secondary to vasculitis. Arterial aneurysms are known to occur with mycoplasma
infection although rare.
