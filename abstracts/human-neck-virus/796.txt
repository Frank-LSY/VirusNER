Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
are radiosensitive tumors and have a better prognosis than the conventional
keratinizing HNSCC. Despite extensive radiographic and clinical evaluation in
approximately 3% to 5% of patients who present with cervical lymph node
metastases, the primary tumor remains occult. The lack of a clinically
identifiable primary tumor usually leads to more aggressive therapy, which can
result in higher morbidity. Herein, we report a case of a patient with an occult 
HPV-related HNSCC, diagnosed detecting HPV in a fine needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC) of metastatic laterocervical lymph nodes.
