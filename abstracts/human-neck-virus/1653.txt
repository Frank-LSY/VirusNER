PURPOSE: Compare functional outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) concurrent with
cetuximab (cet-RT) or with chemotherapy (chemo-RT) for comparable, good prognosis
patients with human papillomavirus related (HPV+) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).
METHODS: Outcomes of patients with stage III/IV HPV+ OPC patients with minimal
smoking history and non-T4/N3/N2C, treated on prospective protocol of RT
concurrent with cetuximab (cet-RT), were compared to similar patients on
prospective chemo-RT protocols. In both groups, videofluoroscopy (VF), observer
rated dysphagia (ORD), and validated QOL questionnaires: xerostomia questionnaire
(XQ), head and neck QOL, and University of Washington QOL, were performed
periodically and compared to pretreatment. Mixed effects models with adjustment
for baseline assessed differences between groups.
RESULTS: 26 cet-RT patients were compared to 27 chemo-RT patients with similar
baseline characteristics. In the chemo-RT group, no recurrences occurred. In the 
cet-RT group, 1 patient had persistent microscopic disease on salvage neck
dissection and 1 distant failure. Both groups had mild VF-based swallowing
dysfunction pre-treatment, worsened at 3 months (P<0.02) and persisted at 12
months, not differing between groups (P>0.11). For both groups ORD was very low
pretreatment, worsened at 3 months and improved at 12 months, without differences
between treatment groups (P=0.26). QOL Summary and domain scores for eating were 
good pretreatment, worse at 3 mo, and then improved to near baseline at 12
months, without differences between the groups in any QOL domains (P>0.10).
CONCLUSION: Both groups had excellent clinical outcomes without significant
differences in objective or subjective functions. These data question using
cetuximab instead of chemotherapy for treatment de-intensification for HPV+ OPC.
