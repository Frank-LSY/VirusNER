BACKGROUND: Disparities in prevalence, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and
mortality rates for head and neck cancer have been described between African
American and European American patients.
METHODS: We studied the HPV status and gene expression profiles in 56
oropharyngeal/oral cavity tumors and 9 normal tissue samples from European
American and African American patients treated in South Carolina between 2010 and
2012.
RESULTS: Overall, 59% of tumors were HPV DNA-positive, but only 48% of those
expressed E7 mRNA (HPV-active). The prevalence of HPV-active tumors was 10% in
African American patients and 39% in European American patients. Tumors positive 
for HPV DNA but negative for HPV mRNA exhibited gene expression profiles distinct
from those of both HPV-active and HPV-negative cancers, suggesting that HPV
DNA-positive/RNA-negative tumors may constitute a unique group.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a direct assessment of differential expression
patterns in HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer arising from African American and
European American patients, for which there is a paucity of data. © 2015 Wiley
