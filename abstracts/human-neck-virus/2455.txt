Mouth Cancer for Clinicians Part 5: Risk Factors (Other).

Kalavrezos N, Scully C.

A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck
cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer. Not all
publications contain robust evidence. We endeavour to encapsulate the most
important of the latest information and advances now employed in practice, in a
form comprehensible to healthcare workers, patients and their carers. This series
offers the primary care dental team, in particular, an overview of the
aetiopathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and multidisciplinary care of mouth
cancer, the functional and psychosocial implications, and minimization of the
impact on the quality of life of patient and family. Clinical Relevance: This
article offers the dental team an overview of other cancer risk factors agents,
such as human papilloma viruses (HPV) and irradiation.
