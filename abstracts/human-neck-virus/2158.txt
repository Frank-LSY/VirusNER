OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to see long-term oncological outcome of
Transoral Robotic Surgery as single modality treatment for cT1-T2 N0 HPV negative
oropharyngeal malignancies.
METHOD: From March 2013 to October 2015, 57 patients with early stage
oropharyngeal carcinoma underwent Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with neck
dissection using daVinci® Surgical system. Patients were evaluated for disease
free survival, overall survival, locoregional and distant metastasis.
RESULTS: 57 patients (48 males and 9 females) underwent TORS for early stage
oropharyngeal carcinoma. All patients underwent ipsilateral neck dissection and
12 patients underwent bilateral neck dissection. 49 patients with final
histopathology suggestive of stage I and II disease did not received any adjuvant
treatment. Mean age at presentation was 59.4years (37-88years). Most common site 
of involvement was the base of tongue (BOT) in 31 (54.8%) patients. Twenty-four
(42.1%) patients were cT1 and 33 (57.9%) were cT2 at presentation. During
follow-up, 2 (4.2%) patients recurred locoreginally and 1 (2.1%) patient had
distant metastasis. Two patients expired due to causes other than malignancy.
Forty-three (89.6%) patients were disease free on an average follow-up of
29months with an overall survival of 93.8% at mean follow-up of 29months.
CONCLUSION: Transoral Robotic Surgery as a single modality treatment is a good
option for cure in HPV negative early resectable oropharyngeal malignancies which
are relatively unresponsive to radiation. TORS can be used to de-intensify the
treatment of early stage oropharyngeal carcinoma and thus avoid the early and
late toxicities associated with Radiotherapy/Chemoradiotherapy.
