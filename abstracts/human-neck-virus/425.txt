Herpes zoster is a secondary reactivation of primary contagious varicella-zoster 
virus in the dorsal root ganglia. While thoracic zona is common, cervical
dermatomal zona is a rare segmental complication of herpes zoster and can be
easily misdiagnosed as other diseases. This article describes a patient with
initial neuralgia without dermatomal lesions that was treated as ulnar nerve
entrapment syndrome until manifestation of herpetiform cutaneous lesions
appeared. It is important that clinicians should be aware of the possibility of
zoster infection when evaluating the onset of neuralgia in a dermatomal
distribution in the upper limb, especially without rash.
