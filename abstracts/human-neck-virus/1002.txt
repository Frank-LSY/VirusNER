BACKGROUND: In human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC), reported rates of HPV integration into the host genome vary.
Among patients with oropharyngeal SCC, we determined differences in demographic, 
clinical, and survival characteristics between those with integrated and episomal
HPV.
METHODS: The analysis included patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal SCC
presenting to one institution during 1996 to 2011. HPV-positive samples were
classified according to HPV physical state as integrated, episomal, or mixed.
Overall, progression-free, and disease-specific survival, distant metastasis
rate, and second primary malignancy rate were calculated.
RESULTS: Among 307 patients, 179 had HPV-positive tumors. Of these, 22 (12%) had 
episomal, 42 (24%) had integrated, and 115 (64%) had mixed HPV. Among the 3
subgroups, there were no significant differences in demographic, clinical, or
survival characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The majority of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs have either
integrated or both episomal and integrated HPV with no significant differences in
survival among the groups. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:1139-1144,
