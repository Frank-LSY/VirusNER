BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related versus -unrelated head and neck cancer after
pathological positive planned neck dissection.
METHODS: Positive planned neck dissection for head and neck cancers from 1998 to 
2010 were included in this study. Outcomes after planned neck dissection were
compared between HPV-related versus -unrelated cohorts. Multivariate analysis
identified survival predictors.
RESULTS: HPV-related head and neck cancer (n = 32) had better 5-year overall
survival (48% vs 27%; p = .021), marginally lower second malignancy (7% vs 16%; p
= .13), but similar local, regional, and distant control (87% vs 89%; 94% vs 89%;
62% vs 58%, respectively) versus HPV unrelated (n = 38). HPV status conferred
reduced risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; p = .038) after adjusting for age,
smoking, and initial T and N classifications.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that positive planned neck dissection for
HPV-related head and neck cancer represents a biologic unfavorable subset of the 
HPV population with unsatisfactory survival attributable to distant metastasis.
The longer survival compared to the HPV-unrelated counterpart is likely related
to a marginally lower second malignancy rather than better disease control.
