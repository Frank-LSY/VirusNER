BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been identified as
a relevant risk for the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs). As HPV status has also gained a role as a prognostic and predictive
biomarker for this entity, there is a growing demand for valid HPV testing in
HNSCC patients
METHODS: Liquid-based cytological smears from 45 HNSCC and 20 control patients
were collected and used for simultaneous immunocytochemical p16(INK4a) /Ki67
staining using a CINtec PLUS kit after the presence of tumor cells was verified
in a Papanicolaou-stained slide. The same cytological suspension was used for the
detection of HPV DNA by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Tumor cells were detected in the swab material of 44 HNSCC patients
corresponding to a sensitivity of 98% (44 of 45). PCR analysis revealed the
presence of HPV DNA in the cytological suspension of 13 patients (13 of 65, 20%) 
with simultaneous p16(INK4a) /Ki67 expression by the tumor cells in 11 of these
HPV DNA-positive samples (11 of 13, 85%) - a staining pattern that is strongly
associated with a carcinogenic HPV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: A simultaneous immunocytochemical detection of p16(INK4a) and Ki67
can reliably be performed on liquid-based cytological smears from HNSCC patients 
using a CINtec PLUS kit. In addition, the same cytological material can be used
for the detection of HPV DNA by specific PCR. The combined results of both
techniques enable better discrimination between latent and carcinogenic HPV
infections as well as HPV-negative cases and thus can provide information on the 
prognosis of HNSCC patients and facilitate therapeutic decisions.
