Persistent infection with the high-risk Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is 
the causative event for the development of cervical cancer and other malignant
tumors of the anogenital tract and of the head and neck. Despite many attempts to
develop therapeutic vaccines no candidate has entered late clinical trials. An
interesting approach is a DNA based vaccine encompassing the nucleotide sequence 
of the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. Because both proteins are consistently
expressed in HPV infected cells they represent excellent targets for immune
therapy. Here we report the development of 8 DNA vaccine candidates consisting of
differently rearranged HPV-16 E6 and E7 sequences within one molecule providing
all naturally occurring epitopes but supposedly lacking transforming activity.
The HPV sequences were fused to the J-domain and the SV40 enhancer in order to
increase immune responses. We demonstrate that one out of the 8 vaccine
candidates induces very strong cellular E6- and E7- specific cellular immune
responses in mice and, as shown in regression experiments, efficiently controls
growth of HPV 16 positive syngeneic tumors. This data demonstrates the potential 
of this vaccine candidate to control persistent HPV 16 infection that may lead to
malignant disease. It also suggests that different sequence rearrangements
influence the immunogenecity by an as yet unknown mechanism.
