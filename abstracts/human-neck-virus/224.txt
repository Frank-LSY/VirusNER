The discovery that the human papilloma virus (HPV) is associated with a high and 
increasing percentage of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is among
the most significant advances in the field of head and neck oncology.
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPVOPC) has clinical, etiologic, pathologic,
and molecular features that distinguish it from HPV-negative disease.
Increasingly, HPVOPC is being diagnosed in clinical practice because of the easy 
availability of p16 immunohistochemistry, a surrogate marker of HPV. The superior
prognosis of HPVOPC has led to a reexamination of treatment approaches, and
clinical trials are currently investigating strategies to deintensify treatment
to reduce acute and late toxicity while preserving efficacy. This is of
particular interest in low-risk patients. Unfortunately, patients with
HPV-negative tumors still have high rates of locoregional failure and more
efficacious treatments are required. This review of oropharyngeal SCC focuses on 
current and investigational treatment strategies in patients with both
HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal SCC.
