OBJECTIVE: The tumour-node-metastasis staging system has a dynamic structure that
is continuously being updated as scientific data develops. This review discusses 
some suggested revisions on tumour-node-metastasis staging of human
papillomavirus negative upper aerodigestive tract cancers.
METHODS: The seventh edition of The American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging
Manual was reviewed and important issues that could be considered for revision
were identified and discussed.
RESULTS: According to our assessment of the oncological outcomes of previous
studies, the following factors should be considered for revision: anterior
commissure involvement and subglottic extension in laryngeal cancers; underlying 
bone involvement in hard palate and upper alveolar ridge cancers; tumour
thickness in oral cancers; and extracapsular spread and carotid artery
involvement in neck metastases.
CONCLUSION: Sufficient data on the prognostic importance of these issues have
been reported. Suggested revisions in line with current knowledge on the clinical
behaviour of upper aerodigestive tract cancers would improve the relevancy of
staging.
