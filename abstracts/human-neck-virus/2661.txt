BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical 
significance of HPV (Human papilloma virus) infection in patients with head and
neck cancer who had received radiotherapy in Eastern Austria.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 patients with head and neck cancer including 26 patients
with oral cavity cancer, 45 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, seven patients
with laryngeal carcinoma and ten patients with carcinoma of the hypopharynx were 
screened for high risk HPV by immunohistochemistry, PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) and in-situ hybridization. 29 out of 45 patients with a squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx received radiotherapy alone, radiotherapy in
combination with cisplatin or cetuximab.
RESULTS: Of the investigated 29 patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving
conservative treatment, 11 had a HPV-positive and 18 a HPV-negative tumor.
Patients received radiation Â± cisplatin or cetuximab, where the HPV-positive
patients had a significant better response to treatment and overall survival (p =
0.015) as well as disease-free survival (p = 0.001) after therapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and a positive HPV status
respond considerably better to radiochemotherapy than patients with HPV-negative 
tumors. HPV screening is a simple procedure and can easily be implemented in
routine pathology investigations and should be included in standard operational
procedures for the diagnosis and therapy of head and neck cancer patients.
