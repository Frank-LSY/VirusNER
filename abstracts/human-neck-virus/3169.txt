The design of efficacious and cost-effective therapeutic vaccines against cancer 
remains both a research priority and a challenge. For more than a decade, our
laboratory has been involved in the development of synthetic peptide-based
anti-cancer therapeutic vaccines. We first dedicated our efforts in the
identification and validation of peptide epitopes for both CD8 and CD4 T cells
from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Because of suboptimal immune responses and
lack of therapeutic benefit of peptide vaccines containing these epitopes, we
have focused our recent efforts in optimizing peptide vaccinations in mouse tumor
models using numerous TAA epitopes. In this focused research review, we describe 
how after taking lessons from the immune system's way of dealing with acute viral
infections, we have designed peptide vaccination strategies capable of generating
very high numbers of therapeutically effective CD8 T cells. We also discuss some 
of the remaining challenges to translate these findings into the clinical
setting.
