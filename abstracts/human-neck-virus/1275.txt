Survivin is known to be highly-expressed in various carcinomas; and is associated
with their biologically aggressive characteristics and drug resistance. We have
previously reported survivin as an important anti-apototic protein involved in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumorigenesis and providing
resistance to conventional cancer therapies. The purpose of present study was to 
investigate the potential of survivin as a therapeutic target in HNSCC. This
study was designed to explore the effect(s) of survivin-siRNA therapy on the
apoptosis in HNSCC cells, and its influence on cisplatin-sensitivity. Lentivirus 
vector was developed to deliver survivin specific siRNA into cancer cells. The
data indicates that silencing of survivin-mediated by Lentivirus-siRNA therapy
effectively suppressed cancer cell proliferation and induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis in HNSCC cells. The study also shows that the response of HNSCC cells
to cisplatin drug treatment at clinically relevant level was limited. We observed
survivin to be a key factor involved in this cisplatin-resistance mechanism, and 
down-regulation of survivin significantly increased sensitivity of cancer cells
to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. Thus, this combination therapy acts as a
multimodality regimen with significant potential to improve clinical outcomes in 
head and neck cancers.
