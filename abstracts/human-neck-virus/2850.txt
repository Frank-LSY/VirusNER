BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) are malignant salivary gland tumors 
noteworthy for high rates of late failure with limited salvage therapy options.
We have previously shown increased Akt signaling is common in ACC and the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV) inhibits in
vitro tumor growth by suppressing Akt signaling. This phase II trial was
conducted to determine progression-free survival in response to NFV in patients
with recurrent/endstage ACC who have failed standard therapies.
METHODS: Eligible patients had recurrent or end-stage ACC and measureable disease
per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. NFV was
provided at 1250 mg twice daily.
RESULTS: Among 15 trial participants, median progression-free survival was 5.5
months (lower 95% bound 4.4 months). No patient achieved a RECIST partial or
complete response to therapy.
CONCLUSION: NFV monotherapy does not result in a meaningful improvement in
clinical outcomes among patients with recurrent ACC.
