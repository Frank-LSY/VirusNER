Nasopharyngeal tuberculosis is a noteworthy disease and it should be
differentiated from with nasopharyngeal carcinoma,especially in southern
China,because of both having similar clinical presentations such as cervical
lymph node enlargement and lesions in nasopharynx. Here we report 2 middle-aged
patients of nasopharyngeal tuberculosis;between them,one was male, another was
female. They came to hospital with the symptoms of pharyngeal pain and neck node,
respectively. The former patient was accompanied by repeated fever. His chest
radiographic displayed suspected active lesions; and nasopharyngeal examination
inspected irregular mucosa with white patch covering the nasopharyngeal area; and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presented diffuse thickening of the mucosal wall
of nasopharynx; moreover, the biopsy specimen pathological results showed
ulceration with mucosal squamous papillary hyperplasia.Finally,acid-fast staining
of nasopharyngeal secretions disclosed acid-fast bacilli was positive. However,
the latter patient was completely different from the former in clinical
presentations, while MRI finding was almost the same. In addition, the endoscopy 
depicted that characteristic of nasopharyngeal lesion was smooth, congested and
swelling, and the pathological result revealed granulomatous inflammation with
epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells of Langerhans
type.Combined their clinical manifestations with various laboratory and imaging
examinations, both of the two patients were eventually diagnosed as
nasopharyngeal tuberculosis.
