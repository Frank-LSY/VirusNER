The role of bacterial and viral carcinogenesis in the oral cavity is increasingly
of interest, as a means to provide more methods of cancer prevention. There may
be relationships between bacteria and multiple strains of viruses in the
progression of malignancy. Cancer cause is closely related to the type of
carcinogen, as well as the synergistic or additive actions of combined risk
factors, the susceptibility of the host, and duration of interaction between host
and exposure to risk factor. Much research is underway to further define the role
of microbial and bacterial agents in the progression of malignancy.
