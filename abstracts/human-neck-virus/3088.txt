A woman aged 48 years presented with fevers, chills, weight loss, and night
sweats. She had significant lymphadenopathy of the left neck as well as the left 
axilla. Her history was significant for bilateral breast augmentation with
textured silicone implants more than 25 years ago. Excisional biopsy of a
cervical lymph node revealed large, atypical cells positive for CD4 and CD30 and 
negative for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded ribonucleic acid, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7,
CD8, CD15, CD20, pan-keratin, S100, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and paired 
box 5. These findings were consistent with Ann Arbor stage IIIB ALK-anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The patient was started on 6 cycles of
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. She initially had no 
signs or symptoms of breast involvement; however, after developing seroma during 
the clinical course, the patient underwent capsulectomy and removal of the
intact, textured silicone implants. Pathological evaluation demonstrated ALK-ALCL
in the left breast capsule with cells displaying a significant degree of
pleomorphism with binucleated forms and numerous mitoses. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization confirmed the tumor was negative for t(2;5). She presented 8 weeks 
later showing evidence of recurrent systemic disease.
