BACKGROUND: The lipodystrophy syndrome is characterized by selective loss of
subcutaneous fat on the face and extremities (lipoatrophy) and/or accumulation of
fat around the neck, abdomen, and thorax (lipohypertrophy). The aim of this study
has been to assess the impact of polymethylmethacrylate facial treatment on
quality of life, self-perceived facial image, and the severity of depressive
symptoms in patients living with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: A non-randomized before and after interventional study was developed.
Fifty-one patients underwent facial filling. The self-perceived quality of life, 
facial image, and degree of depressive symptoms were measured by the Short-Form
36 and HIV/AIDS--Targeted quality of life questionnaires, by a visual analogue
scale and by the Beck depression inventory, respectively, before and three months
after treatment.
RESULTS: Six of the eight domains of Short-Form 36 and eight of the nine
dimensions of the HIV/AIDS--Targeted quality of life questionnaires, together
with the visual analogue scale and by the Beck depression inventory scores,
revealed a statistically significant improvement. The only adverse effects
registered were edema and ecchymosis.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of facial lipoatrophy improved the self-perceived
quality of life and facial image as well as any depressive symptoms among
patients with HIV/AIDS.
