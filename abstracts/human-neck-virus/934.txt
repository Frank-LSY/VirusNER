Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are associated
with significant morbidity and mortality among cancer patients who received
cytotoxic chemotherapy. The aim of current study was to elucidate the prevalence 
of HBV and HCV among large population of solid cancers and lymphoma and to
compare them with large number of control group.
Patients and Methods: Between 2000 and 2014, 8322 cancer patients who were
admitted to Oncology Departments were evaluated retrospectively and 3890 patients
in whom hepatitis serology were available were included in this study. Their
results were compared with control group that consisted of 96,000 subjects.
Results: In control groups, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity rate
was 3.3% and anti-HCV positivity rate was 0.84%. In cancer patients, HBsAg
positivity rate was 3.65% and anti-HCV positivity rate was 1.2%. Neither HBsAg
positivity rate nor anti-HCV positivity rate was statistically significant
between groups (P = 0.12 and P = 0.09, respectively). HBsAg positivity rates of
head and neck cancer (5.88%; P = 0.02), rectum (5.6%; P = 0.025), and gastric and
esophagus cancer (5.88%; P = 0.025) were significantly higher than control
groups. Anti-HCV positivity rate (2.5%; P = 0.0016) was significantly higher in
lung cancer when compared with control group.
Conclusion: The current study elucidated the prevalence of HBV and HCV among
large population of solid cancers and lymphoma and we showed that hepatitis B and
C positivity rates are significantly increased in certain solid tumors. Our
findings should also be clarified with large prospective studies.
