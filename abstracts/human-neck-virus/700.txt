Important advances in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) knowledge have been achieved, but KS 
is still a dilemma. It is an angioproliferative disorder classified as an
intermediate neoplasm due to the absence of conventional clinical features of
malignancy, but at the moment, it remains unclear if KS could be considered a
reactive proliferation of endothelial cells and spindle cells, a true malignancy 
or both. In this review, the authors address the main epidemiological, clinical, 
and biological features, of the five types of KS, with emphasis on KS affecting
the head and neck region. Also, a revision is done in relation with transmission,
the role of saliva, and the pathogenic events associated with human herpesvirus
type-8 (HHV-8). Treatment options are revised, highlighting the need for future
approaches focused on targeting signaling pathways.
