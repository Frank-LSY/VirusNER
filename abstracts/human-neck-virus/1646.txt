BACKGROUND: Conflicting data exist regarding the contribution of human
papillomavirus (HPV) to the development of head and neck squamous cell
papillomas.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded papillomas were tested for 28 mucosal
and 79 cutaneous HPVs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods.
RESULTS: Eighty-three papillomas (43 oropharyngeal, 31 oral, 6 laryngeal, and 3
nasopharyngeal) were analyzed. Twenty-four samples (28.9%) harbored mucosal HPVs:
3 oropharyngeal (6.9%), 15 oral (48.3%), 4 laryngeal (66.7%), and 2
nasopharyngeal papillomas (66.7%). Eighty-one cases were also tested for
cutaneous HPVs, detected in 16 lesions (19.7%): 11 (13.5%) harbored only
cutaneous types, and 5 (6.2%) were positive for both cutaneous and mucosal HPVs. 
Among these 81 cases, prevalence of mucosal and/or cutaneous HPV infection was
43.2%.
CONCLUSION: HPV DNA detection in a fraction of head and neck papillomas supports 
the role of HPV in their development. However, other markers need to be
considered to confirm the association of HPV infection with these lesions. © 2016
