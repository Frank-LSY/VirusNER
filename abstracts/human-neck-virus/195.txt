Enlarged neck lymph nodes are very often subject to fine needle aspiration biopsy
to detect metastatic disease in patients with suspected or proven squamous cell
carcinoma in head and neck region. Cytology specimens of metastatic carcinoma in 
such patients are routinely evaluated for human papilloma virus (HPV) to identify
patients with HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Different types 
of cytology specimens including smears, cytospins, cell blocks and aspirated
material in the rinse can all be used for different types of HPV testing such as 
immunohistochemistry for p16, HPV-in situ hybridization, and HPV-Polymerase chain
reaction. There is currently no consensus regarding the testing of high-risk HPV 
in cytology specimens. The establishment of standardized HPV testing of cytology 
specimens is of utmost importance and is eagerly awaited.
