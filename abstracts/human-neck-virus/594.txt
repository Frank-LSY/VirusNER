Six cases of bacterial tracheitis (BT) occurring early in the 2009 flu season
have been isolated in conjunction with the H1N1 strain of influenza A (H1N1). No 
previous H1N1 cases have presented as BT in the literature to date. We would like
to discuss viral coinfection in BT patients and how this new strain may affect
the rate and type of presentation encountered. The life-threatening potential of 
BT and the pandemic proportion of H1N1 highlight a possibly dangerous combination
that should be recognized by the otolaryngology community. In hospitalized
patients with presumed BT, consideration should be given to routine H1N1 testing 
and the addition of antiviral medication when indicated as this entity is further
investigated.
