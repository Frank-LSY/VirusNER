Eighteen pyogenic granuloma biopsies from patients without a clinical history or evidence of verruca in the studied area were tested for the presence of the HPV genome. The presence of HPV DNA was screened by three independent polymerase chain reaction reactions using standard consensus primer sets targeted to the L1 or E1 consensus regions of HPV genome. The HPV DNA-positive samples were genotyped using methodologies enabling the identification of up to 30 HPVs, including oncogenic, nononcogenic, and cutaneous viral types.
