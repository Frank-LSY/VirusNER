The CMCSCC-1 cell line was isolated from a primary oral tongue tumor specimen of a female patient. Tumor cells were evaluated for biomarkers expression by Western blots, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence activated cell sorter, and immunostaining. Cell proliferation in response to radiation was measured by the WST-8 assay.
