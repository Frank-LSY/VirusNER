BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood infection, which is
usually managed in the outpatient setting. Yet, the more severe cases are
referred for inpatient treatment. We hypothesized that pneumococcal conjugate
vaccines (PCVs), administered during the first year of life, would decrease AOM
admissions rate in this age group. We studied the characteristics of infants
admitted with AOM and acute mastoiditis (AM) in the PCV13 era, routinely given
from November 2010 to all infants.
METHODS: Charts of infants ≤1 year that were hospitalized during
1/1/2010-31/12/2015 with AOM, with or without AM, were retrieved using
hospitalization codes. We compared 2010-11 (transition years, from PCV7 to PCV13)
to 2012-15 (post-PCV13 marketing years).
RESULTS: AOM was the primary/secondary discharge diagnosis in ∼4% of all admitted
infants ≤1 year. Boys had more admissions than girls (62% vs 38%). Accuracy of
AOM diagnoses substantially increased in the post-marketing years. The average
hospitalization duration slightly shortened, from 3.21 (2010-11) to 2.99 days
(2012-15) (p = 0.52). Despite considerably modest pre-admission antibiotic
treatment rate (<30%), AM was infrequent (∼3.4% of AOM admissions). Amoxicillin
was the most common antibiotic therapy given before admission and during
hospitalization. The number of myringotomies, usually reserved for treatment
failure cases, significantly declined, and there were almost no cases of
resistant bacteria. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in ∼20% of collected
respiratory samples, and influenza A/B viruses in ∼8%.
CONCLUSIONS: AOM is still a major cause for hospitalization of infants in the
PCV13 era. Yet, complications are infrequent, and AM rate is low.
