Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is characterized by locoregional spread, and is clinically accessible, making it an attractive target for intratumoral virotherapy. The viruses replicated efficiently and induced killing in a panel of human cancer cell lines including SCCHN cells in vitro and in vivo. These results illustrate the potential of telomerase-specific oncolytic viruses for treatment of human SCCHN.
