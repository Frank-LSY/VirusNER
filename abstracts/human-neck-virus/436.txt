Pulmonary colonization with antibiotic-resistant organisms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is often preceded by upper-airway infections. Although there is a well-described relationship between pulmonary respiratory viral infections and overall disease progression of CF, the pathogenicity of respiratory viral infections in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF remains unknown. With recent advances in respiratory virus detection techniques, this study sought to detect the presence of respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF in comparison with healthy controls and to correlate the viral presence with clinical measures of sinonasal disease.
