Telomerase Cajal body protein 1 (TCAB1), which is involved in Cajal body
maintenance, telomere elongation and ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, has been
linked to cancer predisposition, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), due to
its oncogenic properties. However, there are no specific reports to date on the
functional relevance of TCAB1 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is considered
to be a risk factor for NPC. In this study, we first examined NPC clinical
tissues and found a notable overexpression of TCAB1 in EBV-positive specimens.
Secondly, on a cellular level, we also observed that TCAB1 expression rose
gradually along with the increased duration of EBV exposure in NPC cell lines.
Additionally, EBV infection promoted cell proliferation and telomerase activity, 
but the activation was significantly inhibited after TCAB1 knockdown. Moreover,
depletion of TCAB1 caused both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and suppressed
the activation of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) induced by
EBV, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage. Taken together, we here demonstrate
that up-regulated expression of TCAB1, induced by EBV in the development of NPC, 
is involved in stimulating telomerase activity and regulating the DNA damage
response within the context of EBV infection.
