BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a critical element in the rising
incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), although whether this
trend will continue, and the types of HPV responsible, are currently unknown. We 
previously demonstrated an increased incidence of HPV-related OPSCC in the high
HPV prevalence area of Eastern Denmark from 2000 to 2010. Therefore, we
investigated if the incidence for OPSCC continued to rise, the association to HPV
and putative HPV-types in Eastern Denmark from 2011 to 14. We then projected the 
expected incidence of OPSCC versus cervical cancer through to 2020.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with OPSCC (tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma
[TSCC] and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma [BSCC]) were identified via the
Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group and the Danish Pathology Databank (n = 700).
Tumours were re-reviewed and assessed using p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV DNA
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with genotyping by next generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Sixty-two percent (432/700) of tumours were HPV-positive (HPV+). The
total incidence rate (per 100.000) for OPSCC increased from 4.0 in 2011 to 4.5 in
2014, primarily due to a rise in HPV+ TSCCs and HPV+ BSCCs, although numbers of
HPV-negative (HPV-) OPSCC also increased during the study period. The majority of
HPV+ tumours were HPV16 DNA positive (86%), but we also identified HPV33 DNA
(6%), HPV35 DNA (4%) and others (3%), including HPV18, 26, 31, 45, 56, 58, 59 and
HPV67.
CONCLUSION: An increasing incidence of OPSCC is driven primarily by HPV+ OPSCC.
Sixty-two percent of tumours were HPV+, which is a high-prevalence, although the 
lower number of HPV- cases has yet to stabilise. HPV16 was the predominant
genotype, although a significant proportion (14%) was of another genotype. Our
projections suggest that the number of HPV+ OPSCC will exceed that of cervical
cancer in 2016 in Eastern Denmark.
