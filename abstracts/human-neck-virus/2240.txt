BACKGROUND Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for the large majority 
of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). DLBCL usually arises in lymph
nodes, presenting as a painless rapid swelling mass in the neck, armpit, or
groin. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case of DLBCL that needed only 3 months to
develop a tumor 20×15 cm in diameter in the right groin and even caused scrotum
swelling and lower-extremity edema. Furthermore, this case of DLBCL had developed
other 3 subcutaneous tumors in the chest wall and their diameters were 16×9 cm,
7×7 cm, and 3×3 cm. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan presented with
bilateral pleural effusion and the chest wall tumors with rib lesions.
CONCLUSIONS It is rare that a DLBCL needed only 3 months to develop a tumor 20×15
cm in diameter and even caused scrotum swelling and unilateral lower-extremity
edema due to the large mass located in the right groin. Furthermore, it is
extremely rare that this lymphoma infiltrated the chest wall and even resulted in
rib lesions.
