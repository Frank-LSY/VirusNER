BACKGROUND: Factors influencing survival after head and neck cancer (HNC) include
among others stage, age, and sex. More recently, human papillomavirus (HPV)
positivity has been described as a favorable prognostic factor in relation to
some HNCs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this nationwide register-based cohort study of all 20
925 individuals diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(HNSCC) in Denmark 1978-2010, we investigate secular trends in all-cause
five-year mortality after HNSCC according to the anticipated degree of
association with HPV using a Cox proportional hazards model. Furthermore, we
examine whether any trend over time differed according to sex, stage, and age at 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: All-cause five-year mortality after HNSCC has decreased over time. The
greatest decrease was seen in the last decade (2000-2010) among patients with
HNSCC at sites estimated to be strongly associated with HPV, i.e. the base of the
tongue and the tonsils, where a 28% decrease per five years (e.g. HRbase of
tongue/tonsils=0.72; 95% CI 0.64-0.81) was observed. When examining sex- and
age-specific time trends, the decrease in mortality was most pronounced among
male patients and patients below 60 years at diagnosis. In contrast, no clear
pattern was observed when examining five-year all-cause mortality trends
according to stage.
CONCLUSION: All-cause five-year mortality after HNSCC has decreased significantly
in Denmark from 1978 to 2010, especially for HNSCCs at sites anticipated to be
strongly associated with HPV, possibly due to an increasing proportion of
HPV-positive HNSCCs.
