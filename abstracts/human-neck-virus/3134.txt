Perineural spread of tumour cells along cranial nerves is a severe complication
of primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region. While 
surgical excision of the tumour is the treatment of choice, removal of all the
tumour is often complicated by the neural location and recurrence is frequent.
Non-invasive immune treatments such as checkpoint inhibitor blockade may be
useful in this set of tumours although little is understood about the immune
response to perineural spread of squamous cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry
studies suggest that perineural tumour contains a lymphocyte infiltrate but it is
difficult to quantitate the different proportions of immune cell subsets and
expression of checkpoint molecules such as PD-1, Tim-3 and CTLA-4. Using flow
cytometry of excised perineural tumour tissue, we show that a T cell infiltrate
is prominent in addition to less frequent B cell, NK cell and NKT cell
infiltrates. CD8 T cells are more frequent than other T cells in the tumour
tissue. Amongst CD8 T cells, the frequency of Tim-3, CTLA-4 and PD-1 expressing
cells was significantly greater in the tumour relative to the blood, a pattern
that was repeated for Tim-3, CTLA-4 and PD-1 amongst non-CD8 T cells. Using
immunohistochemistry, PD-1 and PD-L1-expression could be detected in close
proximity amongst perineural tumour tissue. The data suggest that perineural SCC 
contains a mixture of immune cells with a predominant T cell infiltrate
containing CD8 T cells. Elevated frequencies of tumour-associated Tim-3+, CTLA-4+
and PD-1+ CD8 T cells suggests that a subset of patients may benefit from local
antibody blockade of these checkpoint inhibitors.
