BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether matted nodes
uniquely identify patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal
cancer at disproportionately high distant failure risk who may benefit from
intensified systemic therapy.
METHODS: One hundred seventy-eight patients with stage III/IV HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancer who completed definitive chemoradiotherapy were stratified
by risk group (low-risk = T1-3/N0-2c/<10 pack-years; intermediate-risk =
T1-3/N0-2c/≥10 pack-years; and high-risk = T4 or N3). Prognostic impact of matted
nodes was assessed.
RESULTS: At the 52-month median follow-up, event rates with and without matted
nodes were: locoregional failure: 23.3% versus 12.8% (p = .16), distant failure: 
50.0% versus 1.4% (p < .01), any failure: 73.3% versus 14.2% (p < .01);
cause-specific mortality: 56.7% versus 5.4% (p < .01), and death: 56.7% versus
13.5% (p < .01). In multivariate analyses, including risk group and individual
risk factors, matted nodes were the strongest predictor for all endpoints except 
locoregional failure. Among patients without matted nodes, risk-group
discriminated locoregional failure (at 3 years: low-risk = 2.0%;
intermediate-risk = 14.4%; and high-risk = 24.2%; p < .01), but not distant
failure (low-risk = 0.0%; intermediate-risk = 2.1%; and high-risk = 3.8%; p =
.53).
CONCLUSION: Matted nodes portended dramatically increased distant failure and
death risks in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, identifying a candidate
population for consideration of chemo-intensification. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals,
