BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission to health care personnel (HCP)
after exposure to a HCV-positive source has been reported to occur at an average 
rate of 1.8% (range, 0%-10%). We aimed to determine the seroconversion rate after
exposure to HCV-contaminated body fluid in a major U.S. academic medical center.
METHODS: A longitudinal analysis of a prospectively maintained database of
reported occupational injuries occurring between 2002 and 2015 at the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center was performed. Data collected include type of injury
and fluid, injured body part, contamination of sharps, resident physicians'
involvement, and patients' hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and HIV status.
RESULTS: A total of 1,361 cases were included in the study. Most exposures were
caused by percutaneous injuries (65.0%), followed by mucocutaneous injuries
(33.7%). Most (63.3%) were injuries to the hand, followed by the face and neck
(27.6%). Blood exposure accounted for 72.7%, and blood-containing saliva
accounted for 3.4%. A total of 6.9% and 3.7% of source patients were coinfected
with HIV and HBV, respectively. The HCV seroconversion rate was 0.1% (n = 2)
because of blood exposure secondary to percutaneous injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the largest and most recent cohort from a major 
U.S. academic medical center. The seroconversion rates among HCP exposed to
HCV-contaminated body fluids was found to be lower than most of the data found in
the literature.
