BACKGROUND: Advanced stage head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have a 
poor prognosis, this being particularly true for undifferentiated carcinomas.
Adenoviral oncolytic therapy, whose success depends on the expression of the
coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) on tumour cells, might be an interesting
therapeutic option. Thus CAR expression in HNSCC was evaluated in the current
study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: CAR expression in 41 cases of HNSCC was investigated
immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: CAR expression was very heterogeneous and was more abundant in well
differentiated carcinomas than in less differentiated ones. Expression decreased 
from 72.4% in G1 tumours to 56% in G4 tumours.
CONCLUSION: As CAR expression decreases during malignant progression in HNSCC,
its down-regulation in advanced grades of HNSCC is potential indicator of tumour 
progression. With regard to oncolytic therapy, CAR expression analysis should be 
performed prior to adenoviral oncolytic treatment to stratify patients for
treatment.
