Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with poor prognosis that is
endemic to Southeast Asia. We profiled microRNAs (miRNAs) of NPCs using
microarrays and confirmed the results by quantitative RT-PCR. The results
revealed that seven miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and six miRNAs were
down-regulated, in NPC tissues relative to noncancerous nasopharyngeal epithelia 
(NNE). Expression of miR-497 was also significantly reduced in the plasma of NPC 
patients relative to the plasma of noncancerous control patients. The concordant 
down-regulation of miR-497 in tissues and plasma suggested that miR-497 could be 
used as a diagnostic biomarker for NPC. Functional analyses of the effect of
miR-497 on cancer phenotypes revealed that transfection of miR-497 mimic into NPC
cells suppressed cell growth and migration and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous
xenografts of transfected cells in nude mice demonstrated that miR-497
significantly inhibited tumor growth. Two potential targets of miR-497, ANLN
(anillin, actin-binding protein) and HSPA4L (heat shock 70 kDa protein 4-like),
both of which were overexpressed in NPC tissues, were negatively regulated by
miR-497 mimic in NPC cell lines. Silencing of ANLN and HSPA4L suppressed cell
proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in NPC cells. Our findings
indicate that miR-497 is a potent tumor suppressor that inhibits cancer
phenotypes by targeting ANLN and HSPA4L in NPC.
