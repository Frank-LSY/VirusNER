Aim of this study was to explore influence of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine
(Gardasil(®)) on the immune status of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) 
patients. In retrospective observational study, six RRP patients who received the
quadrivalent HPV vaccine and whose HPV seroreactivity was measured were included.
Multiplex HPV Serology was used to determine HPV-specific antibodies pre- and
post-vaccination. Surgical interventions and patient records were analyzed. Five 
HPV6 and 1 HPV11 infected patient were included. Mean antibody reactivity against
the associated HPV type rose from 1125 median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
pre-vaccination to 4690 MFI post-vaccination (p < 0.001). Median post-vaccination
follow-up was 4 years. Poisson regression analysis showed that the quadrivalent
HPV vaccine decreased the incidence rate of surgeries. The immune system of RRP
patients is able to increase antibody reactivity against the associated HPV type.
A double blind randomized controlled trial is needed to determine whether this
immunological increase can cause decrease in number of surgeries.
