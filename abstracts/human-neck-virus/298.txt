Most tumours of the head and neck are attributable to smoking and alcohol use, but an increasing proportion of head and neck tumours are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The aim of this study was to use in house molecular assays to detect and genotype HPV in biopsies from patients with histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, the results were compared with p16 immunohistochemistry staining, which has been described as a potential marker for HPV infection.
