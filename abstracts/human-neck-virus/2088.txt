OBJECTIVES: Patients with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) carry a
high risk of second primary cancer (SPC). In recent years, a rise in incidence of
human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated HNSCC has been recorded. Moreover, tobacco 
and alcohol consumption levels have changed and major advances have been made in 
radiation treatment approaches. This raises the question of a modification to the
risk of SPC, taking into account variations of patient characteristics related to
the HPV-cancer epidemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with a first HNSCC diagnosed between 1975 and
2006 in the French Bas-Rhin region were followed up for 10 years. Multivariate
Poisson regression models were used to model standardized incidence rates and
excess absolute risks (EARs) over years of diagnosis, taking into account
confounders such as sex, age, subsite of first HNSCC and follow-up.
RESULTS: Among these 6258 patients, 1326 presented with a SPC. High EAR values
were observed for SPC of lung, head and neck, and esophagus sites (EAR of 172.8, 
159.3 and 72.5 excess cancers per 10,000 person-years, respectively).
Multivariate analysis showed that the excess risk of SPC of head and neck
(P<.001) and esophagus (P=.029) sites decreased, with 53% lower EARs values in
2000-2006 compared to 1975-1979. In contrast, the excess risk of SPC of the lung 
did not change significantly (P=.174).
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts made by public health policy-makers and oncology care
providers should be sustained to develop effective smoking cessation
interventions, as the excess risk of lung SPC remains high and unchanged.
