Merkel cell carcinoma (cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma) is a rare, highly
malignant, neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with predominance in older patients. 
The tumor is most often located in the sun-exposed skin of the head, the neck and
-as in our patient - the extremities. Notably, the tumor bears a high risk of an 
early regional lymph node as well as distant metastases. Clinically, only a
presumptive diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma can be established. The definite
diagnosis is made by histological and immunohistological methods. Surgical
excision with a safety margin should be combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy.
In advanced tumor stages (lymph node or visceral metastasis), a remission can be 
achieved by different chemotherapy schedules in combination with radiation.
Recently, a previously unknown polyomavirus, named Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV 
or MCPyV), has been identified in 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas. In the near
future, these novel findings could be utilized to distinguish Merkel cell
carcinoma from small round cell cancers and could lead to the development of new 
therapeutic options.
