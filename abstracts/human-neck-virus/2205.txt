BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HPV is found in head and neck cancer from all sites with 
a higher prevalence in oropharynx cancer (OPC) compared to non-OPC.
HPV/p16-status has a significant impact on radiotherapy (RT) outcome in advanced 
OPC, but less is known about the influence in non-OPC. We analyzed HPV-associated
p16-expression in a cohort of patients with stage III-IV pharynx and larynx
cancer treated with primary, curatively intended (chemo-)RT, aiming to test the
hypothesis that the impact of HPV/p16 also extends to tumors of non-oropharyngeal
origin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1294 patients enrolled in previously conducted
DAHANCA-trials between 1992 and 2012 were identified. Tumors were evaluated by
p16-immunohistochemistry and classified as positive in case of staining in >70%
of tumors cells.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (490/1294) of the tumors were p16-positive with a
significantly higher frequency in OPC (425/815) than in non-OPC (65/479),
p<.0001. In OPC p16-positivity significantly improved loco-regional control (LRC)
(adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.43 [0.32-0.57]), event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.44
[0.35-0.56]), and overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.38 [0.29-0.49]), respectively,
compared with p16-negativity. In non-OPC no prognostic impact of p16-status was
found for either endpoint: LRC (HR: 1.13 [0.75-1.70]), EFS (HR: 1.06
[0.76-1.47]), and OS (HR: 0.82 [0.59-1.16]).
CONCLUSIONS: The independent influence of HPV-associated p16-expression in
advanced OPC treated with primary RT was confirmed. However, RT-outcome in the
group of non-OPC did not differ by tumor p16-status, indicating that the
prognostic impact may be restricted to OPC only.
