Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an etiological risk factor for oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). Our study investigates the prevalence,
prognostic, and clinicopathologic features of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer in
Northeast China and elucidates the involvement of p16 in the tumorigenesis and
progression of OPSCC. Specimens from 1470 OPSCC patients collected from 2000 to
2016 were analyzed using the status of HPV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
p16 immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of p16 was observed in 81 (5.51%) of the
1470 cases, and HPV positive was present in 78 cases (5.31%) of the 1470 cases.
HPV positive and p16 overexpression have a good concordance. However, we found
that the etiological fraction of HPV in cancers of the OPSCCs was obviously lower
in Northeast China than other cohorts previously reported. Interestingly, nearly 
89% of patients with p16 expression were smokers, and nearly 70% of patients with
p16 expression had a history of alcohol. Our study also demonstrates that p16
expression is significantly associated with early stage primary OPSCCs and the
patients with p16 expression tend to show better survival following surgery and
radiotherapy.
