15 patients with histologically proven OPSCC were evaluated from May 2014 to March 2015. Swab sam- ples served as positive controls and were tested using both the Hybrid Capture II HPV Test (HC-II; Digene Corporation) and the cobas 4800 HPV Test. Oral gargle samples were tested using the cobas 4800 HPV Test. Five of the 15 patients were confirmed to be HPV-positive by a combination of p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV-DNA in situ hybridization and nucleic acid amplification.
