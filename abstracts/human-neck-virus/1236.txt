OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of oral detectable human papillomavirus
(HPV) DNA in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a sexual
health clinic in London and concordance with anogenital HPV infection. Such data 
are important to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of oral HPV and
the potential use of vaccines to prevent oropharyngeal cancers.
METHODS: Paired oral rinse samples and anogenital samples were available from 151
HIV-negative MSM within a larger cross-sectional survey. All samples were tested 
in parallel for 21 types of HPV DNA using an in-house assay.
RESULTS: The median age of participants was 30 (IQR 25-35). The prevalence of any
oral HPV and of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was 13.7% (n=21; 95% CI 8.7 to 20.2) and
5.9% (n=9; 95% CI 2.7 to 10.9) compared with 64.9% (n=98; 95% CI 56.7 to 72.5)
and 34.4% (n=52; 95% CI 26.9 to 42.6) in any anogenital sample, respectively. The
prevalence of types prevented by the bivalent (HPV16/18), quadrivalent
(HPV6/11/16/18) and nonavalent (HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) vaccines was 1.3%
(95% CI 0.2 to 4.7), 2.6% (95% CI 0.7 to 6.6) and 4.6% (95% CI 1.9 to 9.3),
respectively. There was no concordance between HPV genotypes detected in oral and
anogenital sites.
CONCLUSIONS: HR-HPV DNA, including HPV 16/18, was detected in oral specimens from
HIV-negative MSM attending sexual health clinics, suggesting a potential role for
vaccination, but is far less common than anogenital infection. How this relates
to the risk and natural history of HPV-related head and neck cancers warrants
further study. Lack of concordance with anogenital infection also suggests that
oral HPV infection should be considered separately when estimating potential
vaccine impact.
