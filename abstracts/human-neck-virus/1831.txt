HYPOTHESIS: Different diseases without exact histopathologic classification can
cause stapes ankylosis.
BACKGROUND: Otosclerosis is a complex bone remodeling disorder of the otic
capsule due to persisting measles virus infection and consecutive inflammatory
reaction. In fact, clinical and demographic features of otosclerosis have
reference to stapes ankylosis. In the clinical practice, otosclerosis and stapes 
ankylosis are incorrect synonyms.
METHODS: Nonotosclerotic stapes footplates (n = 284) removed during stapedectomy 
were analyzed histologically. Otosclerosis was excluded during the histologic
preselection (n = 437). Total RNA was extracted, and measles virus-specific
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed.
RESULTS: Nonotosclerotic stapes ankylosis was associated with total absence of
measles virus RNA. Six main types of nonotosclerotic stapes fixations could be
distinguished histologically: annular calcification (n = 152; 53.5%), globular
fibrosis (n = 49; 17.25%), lymphocytic infiltration (n = 31; 10.9%),
hemosiderosis (n = 22; 7.75%), granulomas (n = 17; 6%) and amyloidosis (n = 13;
4.6%). Fragmentation of nonotosclerotic stapes footplates was infrequent (7%)
during stapes surgery. Only 1 floating footplate (0.35%) was reported.
CONCLUSION: Two thirds of nonotosclerotic stapes footplates represented complete 
pathologic bone remodeling. Unlike otosclerosis, nonotosclerotic stapes fixations
were characterized by basic histopathologic findings without organ specificity
that can also be identified in case of different diseases. Prevalence of
nonotosclerotic stapes ankylosis is approximately 30 to 40% among stapes fixation
cases. The long-term prognosis and surgical considerations theoretically differ
from those of otosclerosis.
