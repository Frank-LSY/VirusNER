Circulating tumor-derived DNA testing for cancer screening has recently been
demonstrated in a prospective study on identification of nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC) among 20,174 asymptomatic individuals. Plasma EBV DNA, a marker for NPC,
was detected using real-time PCR. While plasma EBV DNA was persistently
detectable in 97.1% of the NPCs identified, ∼5% of the general population had
transiently detectable plasma EBV DNA. We hypothesized that EBV DNA in plasma of 
subjects with or without NPC may have different molecular characteristics. We
performed target-capture sequencing of plasma EBV DNA and identified differences 
in the abundance and size profiles of EBV DNA molecules within plasma of NPC and 
non-NPC subjects. NPC patients had significantly higher amounts of plasma EBV
DNA, which showed longer fragment lengths. Cutoff values were established from an
exploratory dataset and tested in a validation sample set. Adopting an algorithm 
that required a sample to concurrently pass cutoffs for EBV DNA counting and size
measurements, NPCs were detected at a positive predictive value (PPV) of 19.6%.
This represented superior performance compared with the PPV of 11.0% in the
prospective screening study, which required participants with an initially
detectable plasma EBV DNA result to be retested within 4 weeks. The observed
differences in the molecular nature of EBV DNA molecules in plasma of subjects
with or without NPC were successfully translated into a sequencing-based test
that had a high PPV for NPC screening and achievable through single time-point
testing.
