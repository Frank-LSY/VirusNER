In recent decades, several Western countries have reported an increase in
oropharyngeal and anal cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Trends in
HPV-associated cancers in Asia have not been as well described. We describe the
epidemiology of potentially HPV-related cancers reported to the Singapore Cancer 
Registry from 1968-2012. Analysis included 998 oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC), 183 anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) and 8,019 invasive
cervical cancer (ICC) cases. Additionally, 368 anal non-squamous cell carcinoma
(ANSCC) and 2,018 non-oropharyngeal head and neck carcinoma (non-OP HNC) cases
were included as comparators. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were
determined by gender and ethnicity (Chinese, Malay and Indian). Joinpoint
regression was used to evaluate annual percentage change (APC) in incidence.
OPSCC incidence increased in both genders (men 1993-2012, APC = 1.9%, p<0.001;
women 1968-2012, APC = 2.0%, p = 0.01) and was 5 times higher in men than women. 
In contrast, non-OP HNC incidence declined between 1968-2012 among men (APC =
-1.6%, p<0.001) and women (APC = -0.4%, p = 0.06). ASCC and ANSCC were rare (ASR 
= 0.2 and 0.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively) and did not change
significantly over time except for increasing ANSCCs in men (APC = 2.8%,
p<0.001). ICC was the most common HPV-associated cancer (ASR = 19.9 per 100,000
person-years) but declined significantly between 1968-2012 (APC = -2.4%).
Incidence of each cancer varied across ethnicities. Similar to trends in Western 
countries, OPSCC incidence increased in recent years, while non-OP HNC decreased.
ICC remains the most common HPV-related cancer in Singapore, but Pap screening
programs have led to consistently decreasing incidence.
