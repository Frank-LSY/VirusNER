OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) has
relatively low recurrence rates, intensive post-therapy monitoring remains the
standard of care. Post-treatment biomarkers are needed to risk stratify HPV-OPC
patients for more individualized surveillance intensity and which remain at
higher recurrence risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 115 HPV-OPC patients (ascertained by p16
immunohistochemistry and/or in-situ hybridization) from a multicenter prospective
case study (HOTSPOT) had blood collected at diagnosis, and 64 of these also had
blood collected at post-treatment follow-up visits for up to two years. Samples
were centrally tested for antibodies to the L1, E1, E2, E4, E6, and E7 proteins
of HPV16.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, most HPV-OPC cases were seropositive to HPV16 E6 (85%). In
post therapeutic samples, HPV16 antibody level decreased slowly over time, but
only 3 (of 51 cases seropositive at enrollment) dropped low enough to be
classified as seronegative. At 3years after diagnosis, cumulative risk of
recurrence was 10.2% and 0% in HPV16 E6 seropositive and E6 seronegative HPV-OPC 
cases, respectively (p=0.18). Risk of recurrence was increased, although not
statistically significant, in those with higher HPV16 E6 antibody levels at
diagnosis (per log antibody level, hazard ratio [HR]=1.81, 95%CI=0.47-6.92).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high seroprevalence of HPV oncogenic
antibodies at diagnosis of HPV-OPC. HPV16 E6 antibody levels decrease after
treatment, but most cases remain seropositive for up to two years. HPV16 E6
antibody levels at diagnosis did not appear to be a strong predictor of
recurrence.
