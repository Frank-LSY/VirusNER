Atypical presentations can be expected when leprosy, a mycobacterial disease is
associated with HIV. We report a case of a 28 year old male driver with a high
risk behavior, who came for evaluation of hypoaesthetic, scaly erythematous
plaques over face, trunk, upper extremity; verrucous lesions over elbows and
necrotic lesions over the neck and lower extremities since 6 months. No other
systemic complaints were present. Nerve examination showed grossly thickened left
greater auricular nerve and cord like thickening of bilateral ulnar and lateral
popliteal nerves. His investigations revealed anemia, a reactive ELISA for HIV-1 
and CD4 of 400 cell/cmm. Ultrasonography of the thickened nerves revealed an
abscess in the left ulnar nerve whereas the left greater auricular nerve showed
neuritis. Histopathology from an erythematous plaque was suggestive of borderline
tuberculoid leprosy in reaction. Final diagnosis was borderline tuberculoid
leprosy in type 1 reaction with atypical and varied morphology in an
immunocompromised male with neuritis of the left greater auricular nerve, a
silent left ulnar nerve abscess with early left ulnar nerve palsy. Our case
highlights the atypical morphology of leprosy lesions and the unexpected
protective cellular response as suggested by formation of nerve abscess in a HIV 
positive patient.
