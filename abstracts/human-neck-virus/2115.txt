BACKGROUND: Although HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
has good prognosis, a small proportion of patients develop distant metastases and
have worse outcomes. Such metastases can be particularly difficult to diagnose in
the lung and mediastinum, where they show extensive morphologic overlap with
primary pulmonary neoplasms. This case series discusses metastatic HPV-related
HNSCC in lung and mediastinal fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology.
METHODS: The cytopathology archives were searched for lung and mediastinal FNA
specimens of patients with HNSCC. Specimens were included if either the index FNA
or the patient's original HNSCC was positive for HPV by DNA in-situ hybridization
(ISH). Ten such cases were identified. Patient demographics and primary tumor
details were tabulated from the electronic medical record. All FNA slides and
stains were reviewed.
RESULTS: The ten patients (mean age of 58.2 years) included 4 smokers. Smears
from all cases were hypercellular and hyperchromatic, with focal keratinization
in 6/10 (60%). Core biopsies and cell blocks showed basaloid morphology with
variable amounts of necrosis. All ten FNAs were diffusely positive for p16 (100%)
and 7/9 cases stained (77.8%) were positive for HPV DNA ISH.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic HPV-related HNSCC to the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes
share the characteristic basaloid, minimally keratinizing morphology seen in
Primary HNSCC cytology. Poorly differentiated pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma
and neuroendocrine carcinomas are the primary differentials. Although primary
lung neoplasms are not HPV-related, p16 positivity can be seen in both squamous
cell and small cell lung carcinomas. HPV ISH allows definitive diagnosis of
metastatic HPV-related HNSCC.
