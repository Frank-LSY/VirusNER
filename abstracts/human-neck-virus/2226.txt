The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is rising and this
increase is linked to sexual behaviors. Viral and epidemiological studies have
linked tonsillar and base of tongue carcinoma with a human papilloma virus (HPV) 
infection. The patients involved are usually younger and do not exhibit other
risk factors such as smoking and alcohol abuse. HPV positive squamous cell
carcinoma are associated with a better prognosis than other head and neck
carcinoma. Differences in the carcinogenesis mechanisms open options for
different and specific oncologic treatments and the potential for prevention of
these HPV-related carcinoma by vaccination.
