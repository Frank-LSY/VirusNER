In the 9 years since the last World Health Organization (WHO) classification for 
head and neck tumors, a great deal has changed. In particular, human
papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as the major etiologic agent and patient
prognostic marker for squamous cell carcinoma, most profoundly in the oropharynx.
It also casts a long shadow over all of the rest of head and neck cancer given
its biologic and prognostic implications. By contrast, little has changed
regarding our knowledge of Epstein-Barr virus in head and neck cancers, except as
it relates to HPV in nonkeratinizing-type nasopharyngeal carcinomas. This article
discusses some of the major advances in our understanding of virus-related
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and suggests several specific
concepts and terminology for incorporation into the next WHO classification.
