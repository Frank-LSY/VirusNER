OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C
(VEGF-C), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1),
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHOD: LMP1, COX-2 and VEGF-C were detects by immunohistochemical staining for
57 case NPC tissue.
RESULT: The positives rates of LMP1, COX-2 and VEGF-C detected by
immunohistochemical staining were 49.1% (28/57), 75.4% (43/57) and 59.6% (34/57),
respectively. The expression of LMP1, COX-2 and VEGF-C were correlated to each
other in NPC (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: LMP1 and COX-2 may induce expression of VEGF-C directly or LMP1
induce expression of VEGF-C by induce COX-2 expression, may contribute to lymph
metastasis and develop NPC.
