OBJECTIVES: The optimal concurrent regimen, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or
bioradiotherapy (BRT), in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(LAHNSCC) remains controversial, especially in human papilloma virus-associated
patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 265 patients with LAHNSCC treated with CRT
(cisplatin, 100mg/m(2) every 3weeks, n=194) or BRT (weekly cetuximab, n=71),
including 119 patients with known HPV/p16 status were analyzed.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 54.5months. The 5-year progression-free survival
(PFS) and locoregional control (LRC) were 51.7% vs. 36.9% (p=0.01) and 74.2% vs. 
51.2% (p=0.002), both in favor of CRT. Multivariate analysis adjusted for p16
status continued to show improved outcomes (PFS and LRC) for CRT. The 5-year LRC 
was significantly better with CRT vs. BRT both in the p16+ subgroup (p=0.01) and 
in p16- or unknown subgroup (p=0.02), and 5-year PFS was of non-significant trend
of improvement with CRT vs. BRT in both subgroups (p=0.07 in p16+ and p=0.09 in
p16- or unknown, respectively). In the subset of oropharyngeal cancer patients
with HPV/p16 status available (n=88), MVA after adjusted for other clinical
co-variates showed a non-significant trend of improvement of LRC with CRT
compared with BRT (HR=0.4, 95%CI, 0.1-1.0; p=0.06).
CONCLUSION: Our long-term results suggested better outcomes in LAHNSCC patients
receiving concurrent cisplatin over cetuximab regardless of HPV/p16 status.
