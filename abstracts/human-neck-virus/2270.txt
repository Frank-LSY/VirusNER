Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) are common, have poor outcomes,
and comprise two biologically and clinically distinct diseases. While OPSCC that 
arise from human papillomavirus infections (HPV+) have better overall survival
than their HPV- counterparts, the incidence of HPV+ OPSCC is increasing
dramatically, affecting younger individuals which are often left with life-long
co-morbidities from aggressive treatment. To identify patients which do poorly
versus those who might benefit from milder regimens, risk-stratifying biomarkers 
are now needed within this population. One potential marker is the DEK
oncoprotein, whose transcriptional upregulation in most malignancies is
associated with chemotherapy resistance, advanced tumor stage, and worse
outcomes. Herein, a retrospective case study was performed on DEK protein
expression in therapy-na√Øve surgical resections from 194 OPSCC patients. We found
that DEK was associated with advanced tumor stage, increased hazard of death, and
interleukin IL6 expression in HPV16+ disease. Surprisingly, DEK levels in HPV16- 
OPSCC were not associated with advanced tumor stage or increased hazard of death.
Overall, these findings mark HPV16- OPSCC as an exceptional malignancy were DEK
expression does not correlate with outcome, and support the potential prognostic 
utility of DEK to identify aggressive HPV16+ disease.
