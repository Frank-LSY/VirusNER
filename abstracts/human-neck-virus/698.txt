HPV16-DNA and p16 overexpression were present in 27% of HNSCCs. All cervical lymph node metastases of HPV16-positive HNSCC showed HPV16-DNA. HPV16 was strongly associated with tumors arising from the oropharyngeal site (p < .000001), favorable outcome after standard therapy in univariate (p = .001) and multivariate (p = .0004) analysis, and cervical lymph node metastases before primary detection.
