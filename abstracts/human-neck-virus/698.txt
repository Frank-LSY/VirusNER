Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be associated with several types of human 
cancer, including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and head-and-neck
cancers. Among these cancers, HPV-associated head-and-neck cancers, inclusive of 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral cavity squamous cell
carcinomas (OCSCC), have recently risen dramatically in men under 50 years old.
Within 20 years, the percentage of HPV-positive OSCC in total OSCC went from less
than 20% to more than 70% in the United States and some European countries. This 
article reviews the incidence trend and pathogenesis of HPV-associated
head-and-neck cancers as well as current treatment modalities for the disease.
