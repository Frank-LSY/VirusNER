OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus
vaccine, Gardasil, on the disease course of patients with recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis (RRP).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with RRP was conducted and 20
patients were selected who had received the Gardasil vaccine as part of their
treatment. Efficacy was assessed by calculating the intersurgical interval (ISI) 
before and after receiving the vaccine, as well as number of complete and partial
remissions.
RESULTS: Analysis of all patients found a significant increase in the ISI of 3.1 
months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-5.19, P=0.0061). Male patients
experienced an increase in the ISI of 4.2 months (95% CI: 1.6-6.7, P=0.0048).
Female patients had a nonsignificant increase in ISI of 1.2 months (95% CI:
3.1-5.4, P=0.51). Eight patients (40%; six male and two female) experienced
complete remission. Five patients (25%) overall (three male and two female)
experienced partial remission. In total, complete or partial remission was
achieved in a total of 13 (65%) patients (nine male and four female).
CONCLUSIONS: The Gardasil vaccine can modulate the severity of RRP and induce
remission in some patients. The effect was much greater in males and in females
in low estrogen states.
