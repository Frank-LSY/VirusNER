The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has increased over
the past decades in many western countries. This trend is mainly attributed to
the human papillomavirus (HPV). Cancer-related actions of immunological defense
systems are being intensively researched. Human toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a 
family of pattern recognition receptors that participate in the immunological
defense against pathogens, but their actions are also linked to cancer. The
expression of TLRs in cervical epithelium alters both during the clearance of HPV
infection and the HPV-induced neoplasia, but the expression of TLRs has not been 
studied in OPSCC. Thirty-five paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed, squamous cell
carcinoma tissue specimens were analyzed for TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 and HPV
and p16 statuses. The TLR 9 expression was lower in HPV-positive tumors compared 
with HPV-negative tumors. TLR 7 was expressed in all cancer specimens, but
elevated expression was evident in HPV and/or p16-positive tumors. The majority
of p16-positive tumors did not express TLR 5, whereas its expression was stronger
in p16-negative tumors. The results of in vitro analysis of five human OPSCC cell
lines and one human oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line agree with the 
in vivo trends: low levels of TLR 5 and high levels of TLR 7 in p16-positive
OPSCC. Overall, TLR 7 and 9 expression patterns are demonstrated here to relate
to the HPV status in vivo and TLR 5 and 7 expression patterns to the p16 status
in vivo and in vitro.
