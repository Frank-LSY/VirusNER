OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Although several imaging characteristics of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have
been reported, imaging features of nodal metastasis and influence to outcomes
have not been well studied thus far. The purpose of the study was to investigate 
the imaging characteristics of nodal metastasis by HPV status in HNSCC and to
clarify whether those findings influence the outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for initial staging
on 139 patients of HNSCC with known HPV status were retrospectively reviewed. We 
investigated imaging characteristics of the nodal metastasis including the
presence of extracapsular spread (ECS), and also investigated the influence of
nodal metastasis characteristics to outcomes by HPV status. Two-year actuarial
control and survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with nodal metastasis were identified and outcome 
information was available for 78 patients. Nodal metastasis was significantly
more common in HPV-positive patients compared to HPV-negative patients (75% vs.
54%, P = 0.009). HPV-positive patients showed a higher prevalence of ECS compared
to HPV-negative patients (77% vs. 56%, P = 0.041). The prevalence of disease
recurrence was more common in HPV-negative patients (67% vs. 13%, P < 0.0001),
and it was independent of the presence of ECS in nodal metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Nodal metastases were significantly more common in HPV-positive
HNSCC, whereas the prevalence of disease recurrence was greater in HPV-negative
HNSCC. Although ECS was noted in the majority of the HPV-positive patients with
nodal metastasis, rates of recurrence were lower compared to HPV-negative
patients.
