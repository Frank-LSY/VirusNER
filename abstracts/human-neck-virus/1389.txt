BACKGROUND: Defects in the adaptive immune response to human papillomavirus-6 and
-11 are among the most important mechanisms for Juvenile-onset Recurrent
Respiratory Papillomatosis (JORRP) development. However, the percentage of CD8+ T
cells and peripheral TH1/TH2 immune responses in Juvenile-onset Recurrent
Respiratory Papillomatosis is still not well addressed due to limited sample
sizes.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were diagnosed with JORRP and underwent
surgical intervention at the Beijing TongRen Hospital from October 2015 to March 
2016 were enrolled in our study. The CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in periphery
blood were measured by flow cytometry. Intracellular staining was also performed 
to determine IFN-γ and IL-4 secretion by CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. Serum
IFN-γ and IL-4 levels were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: We found that the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral
blood of JORRP patients were comparable to that of healthy controls. Moreover,
after PMA stimulation, there was no significant change in IFN-γ secretion by
either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. The secretion of IL-4 but not IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells 
was increased, and the serum IL-4 levels were elevated in JORRP patients.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that only TH2 responses were enhanced but that the TH1
responses did not change in the peripheral immunity of JORRP patients.
