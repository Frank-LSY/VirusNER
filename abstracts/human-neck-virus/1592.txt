PURPOSE: Both the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and an oncolytic herpes simplex
virus-1 (oHSV)-expressing GM-CSF are currently FDA approved. Although proteasome 
blockade can increase oHSV replication, immunologic consequences, and consequent 
immunotherapy potential are unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of
bortezomib combined with oHSV on tumor cell death and sensitivity to natural
killer (NK) cell immunotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Western blot, flow cytometry, and caspase 3/7 activity
assays were used to evaluate the induction of apoptosis/autophagy and/or
necroptotic cell death. Cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production was measured using CellROX and MitoSOX. Inhibitors/shRNA-targeting
ROS, JNK and RIP1 kinase (RIPK1) were used to investigate the mechanism of cell
killing. The synergistic interaction between oHSV and bortezomib was calculated
using a Chou-Talalay analysis. NK cells isolated from normal human blood were
co-cultured with tumor cells to evaluate cellular interactions. Q-PCR, ELISA, and
FACS analysis were used to evaluate NK cell activation. Intracranial tumor
xenografts were used to evaluate antitumor efficacy.
RESULTS: Combination treatment with bortezomib- and oHSV-induced necroptotic cell
death and increased the production of mitochondrial ROS and JNK phosphorylation. 
Inhibitors/shRNA of RIPK1 and JNK rescued synergistic cell killing. Combination
treatment also significantly enhanced NK cell activation and adjuvant NK cell
therapy of mice treated with bortezomib and oHSV improved antitumor efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a significant rationale for triple combination
therapy with bortezomib, oHSV, and NK cells to improve efficacy, in glioblastoma 
patients. Clin Cancer Res; 22(21); 5265-76. ©2016 AACRSee related commentary by
