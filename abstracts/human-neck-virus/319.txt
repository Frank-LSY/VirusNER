Human papillomavirus (HPV) is well recognized as a causative agent for anogenital
and oropharyngeal cancers, however, the biology of HPV infection at different
mucosal locations, specifically the oral cavity, is not well understood.
Importantly, it has yet to be determined if oral tissues are permissive for HPV
infection and replication. We investigated for the first time the titers,
infectivity, and maturation of HPV16 in oral epithelial versus genital epithelial
tissue. We show that infectious HPV16 virions can be produced in oral tissue.
This demonstrates, for the first time, that infectious virus could be spread via 
the oral cavity. HPV16 derived from oral tissue utilize a tissue-spanning redox
gradient that facilitates the maturation of virions over time. Maturation is
manifested by virion stability and increased susceptibility to neutralization
with anti-HPV16 L1 antibodies. However, susceptibility to neutralization by
anti-HPV16 L2 specific antibodies decreases during the maturation of HPV16
virions in oral tissue.
