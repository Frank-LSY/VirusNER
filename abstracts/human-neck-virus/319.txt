We recruited 248 HNSCC patients with histologically confirmed primary SCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx diagnosed between 2004 and 2010. All patients completed a questionnaire. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records. HPV presence in paraffin-embedded tumours was determined by PCR, and expression of p16(INK4a), p21(WAF1), p53, pRB, cyclin D1, and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry.
