Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted virus and an
important etiologic factor in head and neck cancers. HIV-infected individuals are
at increased risk of developing oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) compared with the
general population. HPV-positive OPC are also increasingly a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality for HIV-infected individuals in the era of effective
combination antiretroviral therapy. The epidemiology and natural history of oral 
HPV infection have not been well established, but it appears that oral HPV
infection is less common than anal infection, and more common among HIV-infected 
persons than the general population. Prevention of OPC is therefore increasingly 
important in HIV-infected individuals. Although not demonstrated in randomized
controlled trials, HPV vaccination may prevent oral HPV infection as well. The
focus of organized HPV cancer prevention programs should include prophylactic HPV
vaccination to reduce the burden of high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV types who have
not yet been exposed.
