Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common head and neck cancer. The incidence
rate is higher in southern China and Southeast Asia in comparison with the
Western countries. Radiotherapy is the standard treatment of NPC as the cancer
cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation. Radiation treatment has good local
control to patients with early NPC. It is essential to monitor the response of
the NPC cells to radiation treatment in advance in order to select suitable
treatment choice for the patients. This review aims to discuss the potential use 
of biomarkers in monitoring the responsiveness of NPC cells to radiation
treatment.
