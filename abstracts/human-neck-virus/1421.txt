BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity (+) has been used to identify
oropharyngeal squamous carcinomas (SCCs) presenting as unknown primaries in the
neck. p16 overexpression correlates with HPV+ in the oropharynx; however, the use
of p16 alone as a surrogate marker of oropharyngeal HPV+ tumors has not been
validated.
METHODS: We immunohistochemically analyzed p16 expression in surgically resected 
aggressive cutaneous head and neck SCC primaries and their nodal metastases from 
24 patients to determine the potential overlap of p16 expression outside of the
oropharynx.
RESULTS: Five of 24 primary tumors (20.8%) and 3 lymph node metastases (12.5%) in
levels II, III, and V, and the periparotid region diffusely expressed p16. HPV
(high-risk types by in situ hybridization) was negative.
CONCLUSIONS: p16 expression is relatively common in lymph node-positive cutaneous
head and neck SCCs; thus, p16 expression as an independent biomarker and
mechanism to determine the oropharyngeal source of an unknown primary is not
advised.
