We previously reported that telomerase-specific replication-component
adenovirous, Telomelysin (OBP-301) has cytotoxic activity to the YCUT892,
KCCT873, KCCT891, KCCL871, YCUM862, HN12, and KCCOR891 cell lines in vitro, and
investigated the association between cytotoxic activity and adenoviral receptor
expression. In this study, we evaluated the most appropriate way to administer
telomelysin (OBP-301) in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck (SCCHN), and assessed the effect of OBP-301 in large subcutaneous KCCT873
human SCCHN tumors in immunodeficient mice. We also compared antitumor responses 
following three intratumoral (i.t.) injections of OBP-301 given daily, every 2
days or weekly. To investigate the mechanism of the antitumor effect, we
evaluated cellular infiltration in treated tumors. OBP-301 showed remarkable
antitumor activity against large KCCT873 tumors, and three treatment schedules
produced similar antitumor effects. The weekly regimen also significantly reduced
the growth of large tumors. Immunochemistry revealed that macrophages, but not
natural killer cells, were responsible for tumor regression. A regimen of three
weekly injections of OBP-301 has remarkable antitumor effects against large
KCCT873 tumors. These results may provide a new platform for treating patients
with localized SCCHN.
