Background: Molecular evidence suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV) has a
role in the etiology of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the role 
of HPV in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is unclear.
Patients and methods: We conducted a case-control study using tumor tissue
specimens from 300 LSCC patients and vocal cord polyp specimens from 300
cancer-free controls. HPV genotype, HPV16 viral load and viral integration
status, and p16 expression were determined.
Results: The prevalence of HPV (all types) was higher in cases than controls [21 
(7.0%) versus 10 (3.3%), adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.37, 95% CI 1.08-5.21]. The
prevalence of HPV16 was higher in cases than controls [20 (6.7%) versus 8 (2.7%),
aOR 2.84, 95% CI 1.21-6.68]. The risk of LSCC associated with HPV16 DNA
positivity was even higher in patients aged 55 years or younger (aOR 3.52, 95% CI
1.07-11.54), males (aOR 4.74, 95% CI 1.33-16.90), never-smokers (aOR 5.57, 95% CI
1.41-22.10), and never-drinkers (aOR 3.72, 95% CI 1.09-12.72). HPV DNA was partly
or fully integrated in all 20 HPV16-positive cases but was episomal in all 8
HPV16-positive controls; however, the HPV16-positive cases and controls had
similar viral loads (P = 0.28). P16 immunostaining was positive in 31 of the 300 
cases (10.3%) and negative in all 300 controls.
Conclusion: These results suggest that prior infection with HPV16 may play a role
in the etiology of some LSCC. This larger case-control study will offer for the
first time the possibility to address in depth the understanding of a
tissue-specific role of HPV in laryngeal carcinogenesis. Further studies with
larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.
