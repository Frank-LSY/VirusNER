CONCLUSION: The detection of human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA in oral rinse with
auto-nested GP5+/GP6 + PCR is useful as a biomarker of oropharyngeal cancer.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of oral rinse to detect 
HPV-DNA as a biomarker of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ten patients with various head and neck
diseases, including 19 patients with OPC, were enrolled. Oral rinse and tonsillar
swab were collected, and auto-nested GP5+/GP6 + PCR for HPV-DNA was performed.
For oropharyngeal cancer, p16 immunostaining was also conducted.
RESULTS: The rate of HPV-DNA detection in both oral rinse and tonsillar swab was 
significantly higher in OPC compared with non-OPC upper respiratory tract cancer 
and non-cancer diseases. HPV-DNA was detected in oral rinse in nine out of 12
p16-positive OPC cases, while none of the p16-negative OPC cases demonstrated
detectable HPV-DNA. All p16-positive cases were also positive for HPV-DNA in
tumor tissue. Based on p16 immunostaining, the sensitivity and specificity of
HPV-DNA detection in oral rinse were 75% and 100%, respectively. Among eight of
nine evaluable OPC cases positive for HPV-DNA in oral rinse at diagnosis, HPV-DNA
was undetectable in oral rinse in seven cases after treatment.
