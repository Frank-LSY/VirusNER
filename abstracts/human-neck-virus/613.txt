We reviewed consecutive OPC patients referred to an academic tertiary cancer center from 2009 to 2011. HPV status was evaluated by p16 staining. Signs/symptoms and procedures to establish diagnosis were recorded independently by two abstractors blinded to the HPV status during data retrieval. Initial presentations (signs/symptoms), interval, and the procedures to establish the diagnosis were compared between HPV(+) and HPV(-) OPC.
