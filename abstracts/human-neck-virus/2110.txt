BACKGROUND: Infection with high risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is associated
with cancer of the cervix, vagina, penis, vulva, anus and some cases of head and 
neck carcinomas. The HPV derived oncoproteins E6 and E7 are constitutively
expressed in tumor cells and therefore potential targets for T cell mediated
adoptive immunotherapy. Effective immunotherapy is dependent on the presence of
both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, low precursor frequencies of HPV16 specific 
T cells in patients and healthy donors hampers routine isolation of these cells
for adoptive transfer purposes. An alternative to generate HPV specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells is TCR gene transfer.
METHODS: HPV specific CD4+ T cells were generated using either a MHC class I or
MHC class II restricted TCR (from clones A9 and 24.101 respectively) directed
against HPV16 antigens. Functional analysis was performed by interferon-γ
secretion, proliferation and cytokine production assays.
RESULTS: Introduction of HPV16 specific TCRs into blood derived CD4+ recipient T 
cells resulted in recognition of the relevant HPV16 epitope as determined by
IFN-γ secretion. Importantly, we also show recognition of the endogenously
processed and HLA-DP1 presented HPV16E6 epitope by 24.101 TCR transgenic CD4+ T
cells and recognition of the HLA-A2 presented HPV16E7 epitope by A9 TCR
transgenic CD4+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that TCR transfer is feasible as an alternative
strategy to generate human HPV16 specific CD4+ T helper cells for the treatment
of patients suffering from cervical cancer and other HPV16 induced malignancies.
