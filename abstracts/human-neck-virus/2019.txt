INTRODUCTION: Despite the human papillomavirus conferring a better prognosis in
the primary treatment setting, the prognostic impact of viral status after
treatment failure in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients is poorly
understood.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 33 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPC) patients with local and/or distant disease recurrence post-treatment, and
looked at metastatic patterns, time to failure and survival patterns by HPV
status.
RESULTS: Median overall survival following local failure was not significantly
different by HPV status (17 months for HPV+ vs. 14 months for HPV-, p = 0.23).
However, following distant failures, HPV+ patients lived significantly longer
than HPV- patients (median 42 months vs. 11 months, p = 0.004). HPV- patients
were more likely to have locoregional failures as compared to HPV+ patients (p = 
0.005), but the difference in distant failure between both groups was not
significant (p = 0.09). HPV+ patients were more likely to develop metastases to
sites other than the lung and bones.
CONCLUSION: HPV positivity predicts a favorable prognosis with the potential for 
long-term survival following distant, not locoregional, failures. These results
have important implications for the aggressiveness of treatment and type of
surveillance imaging performed.
