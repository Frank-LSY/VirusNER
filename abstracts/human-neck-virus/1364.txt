BACKGROUND: Adjuvant treatment can dramatically improve the survival of patients 
with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), making early, accurate detection of 
nodal disease critical. The purpose of this study was to correlate Merkel cell
virus (MCV) detection with histopathologic disease in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs)
of MCC.
METHODS: Merkel cell carcinoma cases with SLN (n=25) were compared with negative 
controls (n=27). Viral load was obtained by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for regions VP1 and LT3 of MCV. Histopathologic disease and viral 
load were correlated.
RESULTS: Merkel cell virus was detected in 16 out of 17 (94%) of primary MCC
(mean viral load (MVL)=1.44 copies per genome). Viral load in the negative
controls was <0.01 copies per genome. Merkel cell carcinoma was present in 5 out 
of 25 (20%) SLN by histopathology, and MCV was detected in 11 out of 25 (44%) MCC
SLN (MVL=1.68 copies per genome). In all, 15 out of 25 (60%) SLN showed
correlation between histologic and MCV results. In all, 2 out of 25 (8%) samples 
were histopathologically positive and PCR negative. Of note, 8 out of 25 (32%)
samples had detectable MCV without microscopic disease.
CONCLUSION: Patients with positive SLN for MCV even if negative by histopathology
were identified. The application of molecular techniques to detect subhistologic 
disease in SLN of MCC patients may identify a subset of patients who would
benefit from adjuvant nodal treatment.
