OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge of the relationship of genital and oral
HPV infection in women.
DESIGN: Review article.
SETTING: Gynecologic Oncology Center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics,
Hospital Na Bulovce and 1st Medical School of Charles University, Prague;

METHODS AND RESULTS: The infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) is strongly
associated with the development of anogenital cancers and of a subset of head and
neck squamous cell cancers, yet a quite little is known about the
interrelationship between oral and cervicovaginal HPV infections. A key issue in 
oral HPV infection is whether it can be brought about a genital HPV infection,
through sexual or other contact and by autoinoculation, or whether it can be
considered a fully independent event. Pertinent to this issue is the frequency of
oral HPV infection in women with a cervical HPV infection. Some studies show that
females with genital HPV infection are at higher risk for oral infection and HPV 
genotype-concordance with genital infection are more prevalent than could be
expected by chance. However, more data are needed to better understand the
natural history of HPV infection at each anatomic site.
CONCLUSION: The relationship of oral to cervicovaginal HPV infection remains
unclear. Nevertheless, published data suggest that HPV infections at these two
sites are not entirely independent, although genotype-specific concordance is
low.
