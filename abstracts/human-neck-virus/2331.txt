PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviewed the recent developments in molecular
targeted therapy in head and neck cancers. A brief summary of other pathways of
interest is also enclosed.
RECENT FINDINGS: The use of cetuximab in squamous cell head and neck cancer is
associated with clinical benefit and, in some cases, survival. However, the use
of targeted agents beyond cetuximab in this disease remains investigational.
Combination therapy of molecular targeted agents with chemoradiation in the
locally advanced setting of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and
nasopharyngeal cancer shows early promising results, but at the expense of
increased toxicity. In malignant salivary gland tumors, the evaluation of
targeted therapy has been disappointing. New therapeutic targets warrant further 
evaluation in these cancers.
SUMMARY: Despite the encouraging results achieved with antiepidermal growth
factor receptor therapy, particularly with cetuximab, targeted therapy trials
conducted in head and neck cancers to date have largely lacked efficacy or are
associated with significant toxicity. Further research into modulation of other
aberrant pathways is needed. The recent identification of improved prognosis
among head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients whose tumors harbor the
human papilloma virus may allow better treatment selection for these patients,
while the identification of a hallmark gene fusion transcript in adenocystic
carcinoma may herald new treatment promise.
