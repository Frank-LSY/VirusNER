BACKGROUND: The studies enumerating the risk of HIV transmission to health care
workers (HCWs) as 0.3% after percutaneous exposure to HIV-positive blood, and
0.09% after a mucous membrane exposure, are weakened by dated literature. Our
study aims to demonstrate the seroconversion rate after exposure to
HIV-contaminated body fluids in a major academic center in the United States.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of reported occupational injuries
occurring between 2002 and 2015 at an academic medical center was analyzed. Data 
collected included the type of injury, injured body part, type of fluid,
contamination of sharps, involvement of resident physicians, use of postexposure 
prophylaxis, and patients' HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus status.
RESULTS: A total of 266 cases were included in the study. Most exposures were
caused by percutaneous injuries (52.6%), followed by 43.2% mucocutaneous
injuries. Of the injuries, 52.6% were to the hand and 33.5% to the face and neck.
Blood exposure accounted for 64.3% of all cases. Of the patients, 21.1% received 
postexposure prophylaxis. None of the HCWs exposed to HIV-contaminated body
fluids seroconverted (seroconversion rate, 0%).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV does not seem to be as easily transmitted by needlestick,
laceration, or splash injuries as previously surmised. Further large-scale and
multicenter studies are needed for a more accurate estimation of the risk of
transmission of HIV in U.S. health care workers.
