Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 plays an etiologic role in a growing
subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), where viral expression 
of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins is necessary for tumor growth and maintenance.
Although patients with HPV+ tumors have a more favorable prognosis, there are
currently no HPV-selective therapies. Recent studies identified differential
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) profiles in HPV+ versus HPV- tumors. One such RTK,
HER3, is overexpressed and interacts with phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in
HPV+ tumors. Therefore, we investigated the role of HPV oncoproteins in
regulating HER3-mediated signaling and determined whether HER3 could be a
molecular target in HPV+ HNSCC.Experimental Design: HER3 was investigated as a
molecular target in HPV+ HNSCC using established cell lines, patient-derived
xenografts (PDX), and human tumor specimens. A mechanistic link between HPV and
HER3 was examined by augmenting E6 and E7 expression levels in HNSCC cell lines. 
The dependency of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC models on HER3 was evaluated with anti-HER3
siRNAs and the clinical stage anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody KTN3379.Results: HER3
was overexpressed in HPV+ HNSCC, where it was associated with worse overall
survival in patients with pharyngeal cancer. Further investigation indicated that
E6 and E7 regulated HER3 protein expression and downstream PI3K pathway
signaling. Targeting HER3 with siRNAs or KTN3379 significantly inhibited the
growth of HPV+ cell lines and PDXs.Conclusions: This study uncovers a direct
relationship between HPV infection and HER3 in HNSCC and provides a rationale for
the clinical evaluation of targeted HER3 therapy for the treatment of HPV+
patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); 3072-83. ©2016 AACR.
