Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in larynx is rare with children and adolescents.
Usually larynx cancer is common with male smokers in the 7th decade. Among
patients with no history of tobacco and/or alcohol consumption several factors
have can play a role in the outbreak of laryngeal cancer: such as individual
predisposition, radiation, gastroesophageal reflux, viral infection, dietary
factors and environmental influences. In literature only few cases of laryngeal
cancer with children are reported. Recent studies show that the most frequent
laryngeal malignancy is the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Besides the recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) based on an infection with human papilloma virus
(HPV) types 6 and 11 (low risk) and types 16 and 18 (high risk) is known for a
possible malignant transformation towards a SCC. HPV type 26 is only reported as 
low risk type HPV associated with cervical cancer. Final diagnosis often takes a 
long time. Initial symptoms such as hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath are 
often referred to more typical pediatric diseases or laryngeal development.
