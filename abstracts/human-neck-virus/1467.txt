OBJECTIVE: Screening for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) among family members has 
been advocated in endemic populations in view of significantly increased risks.
We aimed to compare the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load and EBV IgA
serology as tools for screening patients with a first-degree family history of
NPC.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were compared from 293 newly diagnosed NPC
patients and 475 individuals with a first-degree family history of NPC. EBV DNA
load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while EBV 
viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgA and EBV early antigen (EA) IgA titers were
measured by immunofluorescence assays.
RESULTS: NPC patients had a significantly higher median EBV DNA load as compared 
with unaffected family members (835.4 vs 18.8 copies/mL; P < .001). At 100
copies/mL, EBV DNA load demonstrated a sensitivity of 76.8% and a specificity of 
85.6%. A positive EBV-EA IgA titer (≥1:10) gave a sensitivity of 85.0% and a
specificity of 96.4%. There was good correlation between EBV DNA load and EBV
serology titers (Spearman's ρ = .536 and .594 for EBV-VCA IgA and EBV-EA IgA,
respectively; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated 
that EBV-VCA IgA and EBV-EA IgA were better classifiers than EBV DNA load (areas 
under the curve: 0.942, 0.926, and 0.880, respectively) in distinguishing NPC
patients and unaffected family members.
CONCLUSION: EBV DNA load and EBV IgA serology demonstrate good sensitivity and
specificity as screening tools. EBV-EA IgA gave the best sensitivity and
specificity profile as a screening tool for NPC among high-risk family members.
