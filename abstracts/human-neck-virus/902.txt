This study, the largest to date investigating HPV status in head and neck CUP, identified HPV and p16 overexpression in over one-third of patients. Tobacco smoking history appeared to affect survival in HPV+/p16+ patients. Smoking status should be considered as a prognostic factor in patients with CUP, along with HPV DNA status.
