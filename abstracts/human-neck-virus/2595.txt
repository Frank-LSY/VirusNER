BACKGROUND: Based on the well-recognized etiological role of human papillomavirus
(HPV) in cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal carcinogenesis, a potential role 
of HPV in colorectal carcinogenesis has been suggested. For that reason, the aim 
of the present study was to investigate the presence of HPV DNA in colorectal
carcinomas (CRC) and to study overexpression of p16INK4A as a marker for the
presence of an active HPV oncoprotein E7. These findings were correlated with
clinical and pathological prognostic factors of CRC.
METHODS: The presence of HPV was assessed using a multiplex PCR system of 10
non-biotinylated primers. The amplified fragments of HPV positive samples were
further analyzed by a highly sensitive, broad spectrum SPF10 PCR and subsequently
genotyped using reverse hybridization in a line probe assay. P16INK4A protein
expression was investigated in a subset of 90 (30 HPV positive and 60 HPV
negative) CRC samples by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was found in 14.2% of the CRC samples with HPV16 as the most
prevalent type. No significant differences in clinical and pathological variables
were found between HPV positive and negative CRCs, except for age. HPV positive
patients were significantly younger (p = 0.05). There was no significant
correlation between the presence of HPV and overexpression of p16INK4A (p =
0.325).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the presence of oncogenic HPV DNA in a small cohort
of CRC samples may suggest that HPV may be involved in the carcinogenesis of some
CRC. However, contrary to what has been observed in head and neck squamous cell
cancer and cancer of the uterine cervix, p16INK4A does not seem to be a surrogate
marker for an active HPV infection in CRC. Therefore, further functional analyses
are necessary to elucidate the role of HPV in CRC.
