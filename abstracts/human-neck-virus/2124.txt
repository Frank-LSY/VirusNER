INTRODUCTION: The last few years have seen significant increase in the number of 
available clinical trials in head and neck cancer. It has been difficult to stay 
abreast of these efforts because multiple cooperative groups and institutions are
engaged in their recruitment. This review presents the state of the art of
available clinical trials organized around major research themes.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature, published cooperative group monographs,
expert review.
REVIEW METHODS: Initial themes in head and neck cancer clinical trial development
were first identified along with examples. Opinions from an international panel
of multidisciplinary experts were then solicited.
RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Current major themes of head and neck clinical trials
centered on 5 major themes: (1) recognition of human papillomavirus oropharynx
cancer and optimal treatment strategies, (2) defining the role of transoral
surgery in head and neck cancer treatment, (3) improving postoperative adjuvant
treatment, (4) investigation of rare malignancies, and (5) the importance of
biomarker-driven, innovative, and targeted therapy investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of exciting clinical trials are currently in development or
accrual with the potential for tremendous impact and improvement of the treatment
of head and neck cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Awareness by practicing otolaryngologists and trainees
of these current themes will be essential for study accrual, success, and
improvement in the care of head and neck cancer.
