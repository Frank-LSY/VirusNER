OBJECTIVES: To analyze the prevalence of high-risk HPV (human papillomavirus) and
genetic alterations in nonmalignant tonsils.
METHODS: We collected benign fresh tonsillar tissue specimens from 477 patients
undergoing tonsillectomy because of chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy 
in 2012 (Group A, n=237) and in 2015 (Group B, n=240). Luminex xMAP technique
served to detect E6/E7 DNA from 16 different high-risk HPV types. Tonsillar DNA
and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from the infected individuals were analyzed
using Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Comprehensive Cancer Design panel. The panel targets
578 different genes that are relevant in carcinogenesis. HPV negative tonsillar
specimens from age- and gender matched individuals were used as controls. All
specimens harboring high-risk HPV were analyzed using fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH).
RESULTS: Five of 477 (1.0%) patients tested positive for the following HPV types:
HPV16 (two cases), HPV52 (one case), HPV66 (one case), HPV52 and HPV68
(coinfection, one case). FISH analyses showed that the appearance of HPV in
specimens infected with HPV 16 was episomal. Benign tonsils infected with
high-risk HPV harbored mutations in EP300, NF1, PIK3CA, and RB1 which are
considered relevant in the development of HPV-associated head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of high-risk HPV in nonmalignant tonsils is low.
High-risk HPV positive tonsils harbored mutations in genes that are commonly
altered in HPV-associated head and neck SCC. The role of these mutations in
tonsillar carcinogenesis is an interesting target for future research.
