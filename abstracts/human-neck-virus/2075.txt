BACKGROUND: Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL) is a progressive,
multifocal, exophytic form of leukoplakia with high rates of malignant
transformation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a cohort of patients
with PVL in a single tertiary referral clinic.
METHOD: Cases meeting accepted diagnostic criteria were reviewed with regard to
their pathology, demographic characteristics, management, and outcomes. Human
papillomavirus (HPV) testing was undertaken on a subset.
RESULTS: Almost half of the 48 patients with PVL (48%; n = 23) underwent
malignant transformation after a median 23.4 months. The characteristics of this 
cohort were similar to those previously described, but management was notably
more conservative. Conservative management of PVL was used in 92% of our
patients, but the clinical outcomes seem comparable with previously described
cohorts in which PVL was predominantly treated by surgical excision. All HPV
testing was negative.
CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical intervention in the premalignant phase of PVL may
not influence the rate of malignant transformation.
