Crusted scabies is a less common variant of scabies that is highly contagious,
difficult to treat and involves infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis.
The classical clinical presentation includes crusted, scaly and generally
non-pruritic lesions usually located on the head, neck, palmar, plantar and
periungual region. It was first described in Norway in 1848 in patients with
leprosy who presented with crusted lesions. In this study, we report the case of 
a patient with crusted scabies with florid clinical manifestations and chronic
liver disease due to hepatitis B and delta virus infection.
