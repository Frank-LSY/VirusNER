Therapies for the protection and regeneration of auditory hair cells are of great
interest given the significant monetary and lifestyle impact of hearing loss. The
past decade has seen tremendous advances in the use of adenoviral vectors to
achieve these aims. Preliminary data demonstrated the functional capacity of this
technique as adenoviral-induced expression of neurotrophic and growth factors
protected hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons from ototoxic insults.
Subsequent efforts confirmed the feasibility of adenoviral transfection of cells 
in the auditory neuroepithelium via cochleostomy into the scala media. Most
recently, efforts have focused on regeneration of depleted hair cells. Mammalian 
hearing loss is generally considered a permanent insult as the auditory
epithelium lacks a basal layer capable of producing new hair cells. Recently, the
transcription factor Atoh1 has been found to play a critical role in hair cell
differentiation. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Atoh1 in culture and in
vivo have shown the ability to regenerate auditory and vestibular hair cells by
causing transdifferentiation of neighboring epithelial-supporting cells.
Functional recovery of both the auditory and vestibular systems has been
documented following adenoviral induced Atoh1 overexpression.
