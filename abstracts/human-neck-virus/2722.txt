BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a powerful prognostic
biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Increased epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number and protein expression have been
reported to be negative predictors of outcome. This study examined the
relationship between HPV status, EGFR gene copy number, EGFR protein expression, 
and clinical outcome in HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation.
METHODS: HPV status was determined using p16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry (IHC),
EGFR gene copy number was evaluated with FISH, and EGFR protein expression by IHC
in 212 subjects.
RESULTS: EGFR FISH was positive in 41 of 204 (20%) patients and was negatively
correlated with failure-free survival (FFS; HR = 1.84, P = 0.027) and overall
survival (OS; HR = 1.78, P = 0.082). For p16(INK4A), 85 of 200 (42.5%) patients
were found to be p16 positive, including 75 of 131 (57%) with oropharyngeal
cancer. Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer had significantly
improved FFS (HR = 0.28, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 0.31, P = 0.002). Only 2 of 126 
(1.6%) oropharyngeal cancer patients were found to be p16+/EGFR FISH+. EGFR IHC
was positive in 81 of 93 (87%) of patients and was associated with poorer FFS (HR
= 1.98, P = 0.35) and OS (HR = 2.52, P = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased EGFR gene copy number is largely restricted to
p16(INK4A)-negative oropharyngeal cancer. Although p16(INK4A) and EGFR FISH are
both predictive of outcome in univariate analyses, only p16(INK4A) remains
independently predictive.
IMPACT: Knowledge of HPV and EGFR status can have implications for treatment
options and prognosis in HNSCC.
