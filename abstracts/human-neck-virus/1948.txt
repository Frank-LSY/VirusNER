BACKGROUND: Hypoxia induces stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1alpha 
(HIF-1α), associated with (chemo-)radiotherapy resistance in oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We investigated the effect of HIF-1α expression on
survival in relation to human papillomavirus (HPV) status in oropharyngeal SCC.
METHODS: We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of HIF-1α protein
expression and downstream targets carbonic anhydrase-IX (CA-IX) and glucose
transporter-1 (GLUT-1) in 274 patients with oropharyngeal SCC. Overall survival
(OS) was analyzed in total and stratified for HPV status and treatment.
RESULTS: In HPV-positive tumors (n = 44), HIF-1α overexpression predicted worse
OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.23; p = .012), whereas TNM classification or treatment 
modality did not. In HPV-negative tumors (n = 218), advanced T and N
classification and HIF-1α overexpression all independently predicted worse OS.
However, the effect of HIF-1α overexpression on OS was lower in HPV-negative (HR 
= 1.50; p = .024) than in HPV-positive tumors.
CONCLUSION: HIF-1α overexpression is associated with worse OS and characterized a
subgroup of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC with poor prognosis.
Possibly, patients with HIF-1α overexpressing HPV-positive tumors should not be
eligible for treatment dose deescalation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head
