Clinico-epidemiological and molecular studies have established the casual link
between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer as also
association of HPV infection with several other cancers. In India, cervical
cancer is a leading cancer among women and almost all cases of cervical cancer
show prevalence of High Risk (HR)-HPV infection. HPV has been also detected in a 
significant proportion of oral, esophageal, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile
cancer and in a small percentage of lung, laryngeal, and stomach cancer in India.
Due to lack of organized HPV screening program, insufficient infrastructure and
trained manpower and inadequacy in cancer registries, there are not much data
available on the countrywide HPV prevalence and its type distribution in
different cancers in India. Forthcoming introduction of recently developed HPV
vaccines in India given a new urgency to know the prevalence and distribution of 
various HPV types in different organ sites for the management and monitoring of
vaccination program and its impact on prevalence of other cancers. This review,
summarizes studies on the prevalence of HPV infection in cancers of different
organ sites in India.
