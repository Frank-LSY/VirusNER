A dramatic increase in the incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer has been
reported in some parts of the western world over the past 30 years. They
constitute a clinically distinct subgroup of cancers in terms of molecular
biology, patient characteristics, and treatment outcome. This chapter describes
the molecular characteristics, epidemiology, and demographics of the HPV-related 
head and neck cancers and discuss available methods to detect HPV-related
tumours. The impact of HPV-related biomarkers in clinical studies on radiotherapy
only, altered fractionation, modulation of hypoxia, and concurrent chemo- or
bio-radiotherapy are reviewed as well as the perspectives of de-escalation and
immune-modulation are discussed.
