BACKGROUND: To assess volumetric changes of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
lymph nodes (LN) before, during, and after a course of intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) ± chemotherapy.
METHODS: Each "pathologic" LN (≥1 cm) was contoured on the available
diagnostic/planning CTs before, during each week, and after treatment.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine LNs in 50 patients were identified. Beyond the first week
of treatment, 3 patterns of LN change were recorded: consistently shrinking LN (n
= 33; 41.8%), inconsistently shrinking LN with temporary enlargement limited to
the first week (n = 14; 17.7%), or also during the subsequent weeks (n = 32;
40.5%). Nodal density at planning is highly predictive of group assignment, with 
a larger mean density for consistently over inconsistently shrinking LNs (p =
.009). Also, this grouping predicts the response at the end of treatment.
CONCLUSION: HPV-related LN behavior during IMRT is extremely variable but
somewhat predictable on the basis of nodal density at planning.
