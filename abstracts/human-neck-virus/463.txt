The onset of IDH may occur earlier than reported in the literature. The scalp and retroauricular regions are always affected, and lesions are invariably present in ≥3 areas. Crusting of the nostrils cannot be considered an obligatory factor for the diagnosis of IDH. The recurring nature of IDH was a characteristic found in all cases. Patients with classic IDH lesions who are serologically negative should be investigated by PCR. Therefore, the indispensable criteria for diagnosis are (1) presence of erythematous-scaly, exudative, and crusted lesions involving ≥3 areas, including the scalp and retroauricular regions; (2) recurring nature of the lesions; and (3) a finding of HTLV-1 infection by serology or molecular biology.
