Paradoxical reactions have never been described in patients with
paracoccidioidomycosis or other deep endemic mycoses out of the context of human 
immunodeficiency virus infection. We describe 2 patients with an acute form of
paracoccidioidomycosis who presented with a worsening of their clinical
manifestations while on appropriate antifungal treatment. These manifestations
were severe and required adjunct corticosteroid therapy.
