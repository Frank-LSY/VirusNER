This report describes the case of a 76-year-old woman diagnosed with Epstein-Barr
virus-positive diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the elderly. She had 
an unusual presentation of the disease with widespread skeletal muscle,
masticatory muscle, and parotid gland involvement and the development of
interesting erythematous lesions in the neck during chemotherapy. One month after
completion of chemotherapy, positron-emission tomography (PET) showed features of
persistent lymphoma, but a repeat PET scan a month later showed no active
disease. This case reiterates 2 important points: first, to consider lymphoma a
differential diagnosis in masticatory muscle enlargement and second, to question 
false positivity when interpreting post-treatment PET scan results, especially in
the absence of clinical disease.
