BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines can potentially prevent greater
than 90% of cervical and anal cancers as well as a substantial proportion of
vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers caused by certain HPV types.
Because more than 38,000 HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually in the
United States, current studies are needed to understand how relative survival
varies for each of these cancers by certain demographic characteristics, such as 
race and age.
METHODS: The authors examined high-quality data from 27 population-based cancer
registries covering approximately 59% of the US population. The analyses were
limited to invasive cancers that were diagnosed during 2001 through 2011 and
followed through 2011 and met specified histologic criteria for HPV-associated
cancers. Five-year relative survival was calculated from diagnosis until death
for these cancers by age, race, and sex.
RESULTS: The 5-year age-standardized relative survival rate was 64.2% for
cervical carcinomas, 52.8% for vaginal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 66% for
vulvar SCCs, 47.4% for penile SCCs, 65.9% for anal SCCs, 56.2% for rectal SCCs,
and 51.2% for oropharyngeal SCCs. Five-year relative survival was consistently
higher among white patients compared with black patients for all HPV-associated
cancers across all age groups; the greatest differences by race were observed for
oropharyngeal SCCs among those aged <60 years and for penile SCCs among those
ages 40 to 49 years compared with other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There are large disparities in relative survival among patients with
HPV-associated cancers by sex, race, and age. HPV vaccination and improved access
to screening (of cancers for which screening tests are available) and treatment, 
especially among groups that experience higher incidence and lower survival, may 
reduce disparities in survival from HPV-associated cancers. Cancer
