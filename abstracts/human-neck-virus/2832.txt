Head and neck cancer is traditionally thought of as being a disease associated
with alcohol and tobacco abuse and deprivation. It was the fourth most common
cancer in males in Scotland in 2000 and just over 1,000 cases were diagnosed in
2007. As smoking becomes less prevalent, a fall in the incidence of head and neck
cancer could be anticipated; however, increasing evidence of other aetiological
factors contributing to the diagnosis of head and neck cancer, particularly
oropharyngeal cancer in non-smoking, little-drinking populations, is impacting on
that perception. This review will aim to look at current aetiological factors for
head and neck cancer, along with current therapeutic modalities in treatment of
this disease.
