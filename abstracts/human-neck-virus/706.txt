A total of 45 LN levels were assessed. HPV16 DNA was not identified in HPV16-negative OPSCC LNs. All metastatic LNs from HPV16-positive OPSCC had a high VL and the viral DNA was located within tumoural cells. Among 27 pathologically tumour-free LN (PTFLN) levels 16/27 had no detectable VL, whereas the VL was low or medium (<10(5)copies/million cells) in 8/27 and high (>10(5)copies/million cells) in 3/27 PTFLN. In the latter group, no metastatic cell was identified and the viral DNA was located in immune cells.
