OBJECTIVES: To determine if the behavior of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is affected 
by human papillomavirus (HPV) status.
STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro and in vivo analysis of HPV and CSCs.
SETTING: University laboratory.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We isolated CSCs from HPV-positive and HPV-negative cell
lines. Two HPV-negative cell lines underwent lentiviral transduction of E6/E7.
Chemoresistence was determined using colony formation assays. Native HPV-positive
and HPV E6/E7-transduced cells were compared for lung colonization after tail
vein injection in NOD/SCID mice.
RESULTS: The proportion of CSC is not significantly different in HPV-positive or 
HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. The HNSCC 
CSCs are more resistant to cisplatin than the non-CSCs, but there were no
significant differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cells. The
HPV-negative cancer cells yielded low colony formation after cell sorting. After 
transduction with HPV E6/E7, increased colony formation was observed in both CSCs
and non-CSCs. Results from tail vein injections yielded no differences in
development of lung colonies between HPV E6/E7-transduced cells and nontransduced
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus status does not correlate with the proportion
of CSCs present in HNSCC. The HPV-positive cells and those transduced with HPV
E6/E7 have a greater clonogenicity than HPV-negative cells. The HNSCC CSCs are
more resistant to cisplatin than non-CSCs. This suggests that common
chemotherapeutic agents may shrink tumor bulk by eliminating non-CSCs, whereas
CSCs have mechanisms that facilitate evasion of cell death. Human papillomavirus 
status does not affect CSC response to cisplatin therapy, suggesting that other
factors explain the better outcomes for patients with HPV-positive cancer.
