There has been a significant increase in the incidence of human papillomavirus
(HPV)-mediated oropharyngeal cancer in the United States. This entity is most
commonly diagnosed in nonsmoking middle-aged white males. The majority of the
patients present with asymptomatic, persistent neck masses despite antibiotic
therapy. An awareness of this condition and a high degree of suspicion is
necessary for timely diagnosis. HPV-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas (HPV-OPSCCs) are unique biologically and clinically, and affected
patients enjoy better outcomes with existing standard therapies than do patients 
with OPSCC mediated by tobacco exposure. The p16 protein is usually overexpressed
in HPV-OPSCC, and its detection on immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate
marker for this disease. In this review, we discuss current paradigms in the
diagnosis and management of HPV-OPSCC, and we emphasize pertinent research
questions to investigate going forward, including whether to deintensify
treatment in these patients.
