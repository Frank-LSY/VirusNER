While high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is well established as causative and
clinically important for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx, its
role in non-oropharyngeal head and neck SCC is much less clearly elucidated. In
the sinonasal region, in particular, although it is a relatively uncommon site
for SCC, as many as 20Â % of SCC harbor transcriptionally-active high risk HPV.
These tumors almost always have a nonkeratinizing morphology and may have a
better prognosis. In addition, specific variants of SCC as well as other rare
carcinoma types, when arising in the sinonasal tract, can harbor
transcriptionally-active HPV. This article reviews the current literature on HPV 
in sinonasal carcinomas, attempts to more clearly demonstrate what tumors have it
and how this relates to possible precursor lesions like inverted papilloma, and
discusses the possible clinical ramifications of the presence of the virus.
