During a 5 year period, 33 children (22 males) were diagnosed to have infectious 
mononucleosis (M:F::2:1; age 9 mo-15 y). The common clinical features observed
were fever (100%), lymphadenopathy (84%) hepatosplenomegaly (81%), tonsillar
enlargement (45%), neck swelling (30%), upper respiratory symptoms (21%),
epitrochlear node enlargement (20%), vomiting and diarrhea (1%). Ten children had
complications; upper airway obstruction and hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis
occurred in four each and septic shock in two. EBV associated infectious
mononucleosis in hospitalized children was found to affect mainly preschool
children and had a favorable prognosis.
