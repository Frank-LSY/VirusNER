Eight paralogue members form the family of transmembrane channel-like (TMC)
proteins that share considerable sequence homology to anoctamin 1 (Ano1,
TMEM16A). Ano1 is a Ca(2+) activated Cl(-) channel that is related to head and
neck cancer, often caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Mutations in 
TMC 6 and 8 (EVER1, EVER2) cause epidermodysplasia verruciformis. This rare skin 
disease is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to HPV infection and cancer. 
We found that in contrast to Ano1 the common paralogues TMC4-TMC8 did not produce
Ca(2+) activated Cl(-) currents when expressed in HEK293 cells. On the contrary, 
TMC8 was found to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it
inhibited receptor mediated Ca(2+) release, activation of Ano1 and volume
regulated LRRC8-related Cl(-) currents. Zn(2+) is co-released from the ER
together with Ca(2+) and thereby further augments Ca(2+) store release. Because
TMC8 is required to lower cytosolic Zn(2+) concentrations by the Zn(2+)
transporter ZnT-1, we hypothesize that HPV infections and cancer caused by
mutations in TMC8 are related to upregulated Zn(2+)/Ca(2+) signaling and
activation of Ano1.
