BACKGROUND: To establish etiology and level of prevalence of lymphadenopathy in
children.
METHODS: One hundred and fifteen children aged 0-15 years with diagnosed
lymphadenopathy at the Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo during 2008 were included in 
the study. It analyzed age, sex, etiology and distribution and prevalence of
lymphadenopathy.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) according
to gender and age of children with lymphadenopathy. Leading etiological causes of
lymphadenopathy were infections in 95% (62,7 %) and malignancies in 20 (13,3 %)
cases. The most frequent isolated microorganisms were viruses in 65 children (65 
%) and bacteria in 26 (28%) of children. Most frequent causes of malignant
lymphadenopathy were acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 11 children (55 %) and acute
myeloid leukemia in two (10%) children. Regional lymphadenopathy was more
frequent than generalized lymphadenopathy, in 103 children (68,7%) and 47 (31,3
%) children, respectively. Most frequent localizations of regional
lymphadenopathy were neck, axillae and groin, in 83, 8, and 5 (80,5 %, 7,8%,
4,8%) children.
CONCLUSIONS: The regional and generalized lymphadenopathies in children depend on
their etiology and have significant prognostic value for the disease.
