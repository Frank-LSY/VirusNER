OBJECTIVE: Head-neck cancer therapy has become intensified. With radiotherapy
alone, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) is 80% for HPV-positive TSCC/BOTSCC and
better for patients with favorable characteristics, suggesting therapy could be
tapered for some, decreasing side-effects. Therefore, we built a model to predict
progression-free survival for patients with HPV-positive TSCC and BOTSCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: TSCC/BOTSCC patients treated curatively between 2000 and
2011, with HPV16 DNA/E7 mRNA positive tumors examined for CD8+ TILs, HPV16 mRNA
and HLA class I expression were included. Patients were split randomly 65/35 into
training and validation sets, and LASSO regression was used to select a model in 
the training set, the performance of which was evaluated in the validation set.
RESULTS: 258 patients with HPV DNA/E7 mRNA positive tumors could be included, 168
and 90 patients in the respective sets. No treatment improved prognosis compared 
to radiotherapy alone. CD8+ TIL counts and young age were the strongest
predictors of survival, followed by T-stage <3 and presence of HPV16 E2 mRNA. The
model had an area under curve (AUC) of 76%. A model where the presence of three
of four of these markers defined good prognosis captured 56% of non-relapsing
patients with a positive predictive value of 98% in the validation set.
Furthermore, the model identified 35% of our cohort that was overtreated and
could safely have received de-escalated therapy.
CONCLUSION: CD8+ TIL counts, age, T-stage and E2 expression could predict
progression-free survival, identifying patients eligible for randomized trials
with milder treatment, potentially reducing side effects without worsening
prognosis.
