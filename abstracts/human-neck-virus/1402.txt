α-Synuclein accumulation and pathology in Parkinson's disease typically display a
caudo-rostral pattern of progression, involving neuronal nuclei in the medulla
oblongata at the earliest stages. In this study, selective expression and
accumulation of human α-synuclein within medullary neurons was achieved via
retrograde transport of adeno-associated viral vectors unilaterally injected into
the vagus nerve in the rat neck. The exogenous protein progressively spread
toward more rostral brain regions where it could be detected within axonal
projections. Propagation to the pons, midbrain and forebrain followed a
stereotypical pattern of topographical distribution. It affected areas such as
the coeruleus-subcoeruleus complex, dorsal raphae, hypothalamus and amygdala
ipsilateral and, to a lesser extent, contralateral to the injection side.
Spreading was accompanied by evidence of neuritic pathology in the form of axonal
varicosities intensely immunoreactive for human α-synuclein and containing
Thioflavin-S-positive fibrils. Thus, overexpression of human α-synuclein in the
lower brainstem is sufficient to induce its long-distance caudo-rostral
propagation, recapitulating features of Parkinson's disease and mechanisms of
disease progression.
