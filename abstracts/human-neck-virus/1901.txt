BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the role 
of three hypoxia-related biomarkers in patients with locally advanced head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
(3-weekly cisplatin) or bioradiotherapy (weekly cetuximab).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In tumor tissue material from 100 patients with known HPV
status, we evaluated the extent of tumor necrosis, the expression level of CA-IX 
and the microvascular density (MVD) measured as the density of CD34+ vascular
structures. The correlations between biomarker expressions and
clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: We found a significant correlation of MVD with UICC stage (p = 0.02) and
T classification (p = 0.05), of CA-IX with UICC stage (p = 0.03) and N
classification (p = 0.04) and a significant inverse correlation of MVD with CA-IX
expression (r = -0.22, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that low MVD
combined with high CA IX-expression was a significant independent prognostic
factor for worse loco-regional control (HR = 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-5.0, p = 0.02) in the
whole population but not in the p16+ subgroup. Patients treated with CRT had a
better LRC than those with BRT independent of MVD or CA-IX expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MVD and CA-IX expression might give additional
prognostic information in HNSCC patients with known HPV status.
