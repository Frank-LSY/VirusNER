OBJECTIVES: To review evidence for the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the 
etiology of oropharyngeal cancers, methods of viral detection, and the resulting 
clinical implications.
STUDY DESIGN: Contemporary review.
METHODS: Published journal articles identified through PubMed and conference
proceedings were reviewed.
RESULTS: HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas represent a distinct disease
entity from carcinogen-associated squamous cell carcinomas. HPV oncoproteins lead
to mucosal cell transformation through well-defined mechanisms. Different methods
of detecting HPV exist with variable levels of sensitivity and specificity for
biologically active virus. Although virus is detected in a number of head and
neck subsites, studies demonstrate improved outcomes in HPV-associated carcinoma 
of the oropharynx only. The cell cycle regulatory protein p16 is upregulated by
biologically active HPV and serves as a biomarker of improved response to
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is a
biologically distinct entity from carcinogen-associated carcinoma. Understanding 
the molecular mechanisms behind the improved outcomes in patients with
HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma may lead to novel therapeutics for
patients with carcinogen-associated carcinomas.
