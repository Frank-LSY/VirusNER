BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer of unknown primary (HNCUP) is rare and
prospective studies are lacking. The impact of different prognostic factors such 
as age and N stage is not completely known, the optimal treatment is not yet
established, and the reported survival rates vary. In the last decade, human
papilloma virus (HPV) has been identified as a common cause of and important
prognostic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, and there is now growing interest in
the importance of HPV for HNCUP. The aim of the present study on curatively
treated HNCUP was to investigate the prognostic importance of different factors, 
including HPV status, treatment, and overall survival.
METHODS: A search for HNCUP was performed in the Swedish Cancer Registry, Western
health district, between the years 1992-2009. The medical records were reviewed, 
and only patients with squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma
treated with curative intent were included. The tumor specimens were
retrospectively analyzed for HPV with p16 immunostaining.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included. The mean age was 59 years. The
majority were males, and had N2 tumors. Sixty-nine percent of the tumors were HPV
positive using p16 staining. Patients who were older than 70 years, patients with
N3-stage tumors, and patients with tumors that were p16 negative had a
significantly worse prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with
p16-positive tumors was 88% vs 61% for p16-negative tumors. Treatment with neck
dissection and postoperative radiation or (chemo) radiation had 81 and 88% 5-year
survival rates, respectively. The overall and disease-free 5-year survival rates 
for all patients in the study were 82 and 74%.
CONCLUSIONS: Curatively treated HNCUP had good survival. HPV infection was
common. Independent prognostic factors for survival were age over 70 years, HPV
status and N3 stage. We recommend that HPV analysis should be performed routinely
for HNCUP. Treatment with neck dissection and postoperative radiation or (chemo) 
radiation showed similar survival rates.
