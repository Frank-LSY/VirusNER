In order to investigate the association between length variation of the CD209L
neck region and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 susceptibility, disease
progression, and treatment response outcomes, we genotyped 139 HIV-1-seropositive
and 109 seronegative individuals. The heterozygous genotype 6/5 showed a
significant increased risk of HIV-1 infection (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.99-9.33, p
0.046). Moreover, after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
HIV-1-seropositive individuals carrying the 6/5, 7/5 and 7/7 genotypes and
alleles 5, 6 and 7 showed good CD4(+) T-cell recovery. In addition, individuals
with the 7/5, 6/6 and 7/7 genotypes showed a significant decrease in viral load
during the treatment period as compared with baseline (p < 0.05). Interestingly, 
we found that alleles 4 and 6 were associated with protection against AIDS
progression. D209L variation may influence susceptibility to HIV-1, response to
treatment, and disease progression.
