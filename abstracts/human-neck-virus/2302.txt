We examined the prognostic value of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in
patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after surgery 
and postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. FFPE-tissue originating from
the surgery of 161 patients treated in 8 DKTK partner sites was
immunohistochemically stained for CD3 and CD8. Their expression was correlated
with clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival (OS), local 
progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastases free-survival (DMFS),
also in the context of the HPV16-DNA/p16 status. After a median follow-up of 48
months (range: 4100 months), OS at 4 years was 46.5% for the entire cohort. In
multivariate analysis, high CD8 expression was confirmed as an independent
prognostic parameter for OS (p = 0.002), LPFS (p = 0.004) and DMFS (p = 0.006),
while CD3 expression lacked significance. In multivariate analysis HPV16 DNA
positivity was associated with improved OS (p = 0.025) and LPFS (p = 0.013) and
p16-positive patients showed improved DMFS (p = 0.008). Interestingly, high CD8
expression was a prognostic parameter for the clinical outcome in both HPV16
DNA-positive and HPV16 DNA-negative patients. Similar findings were observed in
the multivariate analysis for the combined HPV16 DNA/p16 status. Altogether, CD8+
TILs constitute an independent prognostic marker in SCCHN patients treated with
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These data indicate that CD8-positive TILs have
antitumour activity and could be used for treatment stratification. Further
validation of the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs as a biomarker and its role in
the immune response in SCCHN patients after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is
warranted and will be performed in the prospective DKTK-ROG study.
