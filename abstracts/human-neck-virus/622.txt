BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a favourable prognostic factor in
oropharyngeal cancer. Moreover, we and others reported that HPV-positive cancer
of unknown primary in the head and neck region (HNCUP) has better outcome than
HPV-negative HNCUP. However, not all studies concord. Here, our previous finding 
was investigated in a new cohort and additional biomarkers were analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 19 HNCUPs diagnosed 2008-2013 were analyzed for
HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) and p16 by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC). Thereafter, 69 HNCUPs diagnosed between 2000-2013 were analyzed for HPV16 
mRNA by PCR (if HPV16DNA-positive) and cluster of differentiation 8 positive
(CD8+) tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
class I-expression using IHC.
RESULTS: HPV DNA, alone and in combination with p16 overexpression, was validated
as a favourable prognostic factor in HNCUP. HPV16 mRNA was present in most HPV16 
DNA-positive cases, confirming HPV-driven carcinogenesis in HNCUP. High CD8+ TIL 
counts indicated favourable prognosis.
CONCLUSION: HPV status is useful for the management of patients with HNCUP and
the role of CD8+ TILs should be further explored.
