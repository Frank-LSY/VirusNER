We present the case of a 6-year-old boy who received a cochlear implant for
profound sensorineural hearing loss after being born with cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection. Even after 6 years, CMV DNA was still found in the perilymph of the
cochlea. Our case shows that CMV DNA can be present in the cochlea years after
congenital CMV infection, and it can explain why progressive and/or late-onset
hearing loss occurs in these children.
