It is now well established that human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important
causative factor in a subgroup of head and neck cancer. In the head and neck,
while HPV is strongly associated with squamous cell carcinoma arising in the
oropharynx, there is a growing interest in HPV-associated neoplasms of
non-oropharyngeal origin including those which arise within sinonasal and
nasopharyngeal mucosa. This article reviews current literature on the association
of HPV with Scheiderian papillomas, sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, sinonasal 
undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoma with adenoid cystic-like features, and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Several clinical implications of HPV detection in
sinonasal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas are briefly discussed.
