OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC) have been shown to have a significantly better prognosis and
response to current treatment modalities. Current guidelines recommend systematic
HPV-DNA and/or p16 testing on HNSCCs, although treatment approach should not be
directed by test results. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess whether
HPV-DNA and/or p16 status are systematically evaluated across North American
otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons and (2) whether the status is used to
direct treatment approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 15-question online survey was sent to three
associations: the Association of Oto-rhino-laryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of
Quebec, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the
American Head and Neck Society.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of respondents systematically test for HPV-DNA
and/or p16 on HNSCC sites, while 58.3% report using test results to direct
treatment for oropharyngeal cancers. A lack of official guidelines was the
primary reason (81.8%) physicians did not use test results to direct treatment.
Academic centre physicians (83.3%) and physicians with ⩾50% oncologic practice
(87.6%) were more likely to test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC compared to
non-academic centre physicians (39.7%) and physicians with <50% oncologic
practices (51.4%) (p<0.001). Cost of the tests (69.2%), lack of relevance (46.1%)
and time constraints (30.8%) were the primary reasons HPV-DNA and/or p16 were not
tested.
CONCLUSION: The majority of North American respondents in this survey
systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC sites, and most indicate that
test results influence their treatment approach for oropharyngeal cancers.
