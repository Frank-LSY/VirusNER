Of 178 total patients, 46 (26.0%) had contralateral/bilateral metastases. There was no significant difference in incidence of contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases between HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients (24.6% vs. 29.1%, P = .53). Tonsil primaries had significantly lower incidence of contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases compared to tongue base (20.9% vs. 34.3%, P = .048). On multivariate regression, tumor size was the only factor associated with contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases (T4 vs. T1-3 odds ratio = 5.15, 95% confidence interval: 2.4-11.2). Five-year overall survival among all patients with and without contralateral/bilateral nodal metastases was 45.4% and 65.2%, respectively (P = .007).
