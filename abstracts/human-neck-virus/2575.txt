OBJECTIVE: To develop decision trees predicting for tumor volume reduction in
patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer using pretreatment clinical and
pathological parameters.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients treated with definitive concurrent
chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, oropharynx,
oral cavity, or hypopharynx were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were
rescanned at a median dose of 37.8 Gy and replanned to account for anatomical
changes. The percentages of gross tumor volume (GTV) change from initial to
rescan computed tomography (CT; %GTVΔ) were calculated. Two decision trees were
generated to correlate %GTVΔ in primary and nodal volumes with 14 characteristics
including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), site, human papilloma 
virus (HPV) status, tumor grade, primary tumor growth pattern
(endophytic/exophytic), tumor/nodal/group stages, chemotherapy regimen, and
primary, nodal, and total GTV volumes in the initial CT scan. The C4.5 Decision
Tree induction algorithm was implemented.
RESULTS: The median %GTVΔ for primary, nodal, and total GTVs was 26.8%, 43.0%,
and 31.2%, respectively. Type of chemotherapy, age, primary tumor growth pattern,
site, KPS, and HPV status were the most predictive parameters for primary %GTVΔ
decision tree, whereas for nodal %GTVΔ, KPS, site, age, primary tumor growth
pattern, initial primary GTV, and total GTV volumes were predictive. Both
decision trees had an accuracy of 88%.
CONCLUSIONS: There can be significant changes in primary and nodal tumor volumes 
during the course of H&N chemoradiotherapy. Considering the proposed decision
trees, radiation oncologists can select patients predicted to have high %GTVΔ,
who would theoretically gain the most benefit from adaptive radiotherapy, in
order to better use limited clinical resources.
