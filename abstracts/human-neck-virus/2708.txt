OBJECTIVE: Although neurogenic cough is increasingly recognised, its
pathophysiology remains obscure. We describe two cases of chronic cough following
laryngeal herpes zoster, a rarely described manifestation of varicella-zoster
virus reactivation, and suggest that this may be analogous to post-herpetic
neuralgia. The same mechanisms may cause both phenomena.
CASE REPORTS: We describe two cases of chronic cough persisting for more than
three months following an acute attack of laryngeal herpes zoster.
CONCLUSION: Neuronal damage by varicella-zoster virus results in irritable
nociceptors and deafferentation, mechanisms known to cause post-herpetic
neuralgia. When the vagus nerve is affected, as in laryngeal herpes zoster, the
result may be a chronic cough. Similar damage may underlie chronic neurogenic
cough in other contexts.
