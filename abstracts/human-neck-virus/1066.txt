BACKGROUND: The tumor protein p73 interacts with the human papillomavirus type 16
(HPV-16) oncoproteins E6 and E7, and p73 variation may modify the interaction
between p73 protein and HPV-16 oncogenic proteins and contribute to cellular
malignant transformation.
METHODS: In this case-case comparison study, the authors analyzed HPV-16 status
in tumor specimens and genotyped the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism using
genomic DNA from blood of 202 non-Hispanic white patients with squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) were calculated in univariate and multivariable logistic
regression models to examine the association between the p73 polymorphism and
HPV-16 status in SCCHN.
RESULTS: Compared with the p73 GC/GC genotype, the AT/AT and combined GC/AT +
AT/AT variant genotypes were associated significantly with HPV-16-positive tumor 
status among patients with SCCHN (adjusted OR, 5.32; 95% CI, 1.32-21.4; adjusted 
OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.03-3.53, respectively). There was a significant dose-effect
relation between the AT allele and HPV-16-positive tumor status in patients with 
SCCHN (trend test: P = .014). Moreover, the stratified analyses indicated that
the association between HPV-16-positive tumor status and the combined p73 GC/AT +
AT/AT genotypes was more pronounced among several subgroups of patients who were 
older, men, ever drinkers, and those with oropharyngeal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The p73 polymorphism was associated with HPV-16 status in SCCHN and 
may serve as a marker of positive HPV-16 tumor status in patients with SCCHN,
particularly those with oropharyngeal cancer.
