BACKGROUND: The American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) recently created new
staging for human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+ OPSCC) for
its 8th edition. These proposals have not yet been validated in a national
registry.
METHODS: Review of National Cancer Database (NCDB) for surgically-treated HPV+
OPSCC for years 2010-2014 to validate the new staging system using the Kaplan
Meier method to explore survival outcomes.
RESULTS: 3745 cases were analyzed. Median follow-up was 31.3months. Most patients
were Caucasian males with tonsillar cancer. Distribution of stage I disease
increased from 3.7% to 80.2% in AJCC 8th. pN1 disease shifted from 17.3% to
75.9%. Treatment and distribution of T-stage varied by pathologic nodal (pN)
staging. Extranodal extension (ENE) was positive in 41% cases. Four-year overall 
survival (OS) for AJCC 8th stages I (92%), II (81%), and stage III (62%) showed
excellent hazard discrimination (all pairwise p<0.001). Only 4-year OS by pN
staging showed significantly different curves when comparing pN2 (79%) with
others (pN0 88%; pN1 91%, p=0.01 and <0.001 respectively). Presence of ENE
confers a negative effect on overall survival (92% ENE- vs. 85% ENE+, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The NCDB shows improved hazard discrimination and outcome prediction 
in the AJCC 8th edition staging for HPV+ OPSCC. While overall staging had
excellent hazard discrimination, this accounted for poorer discrimination between
pN0 and pN1. The majority of patients are reclassified as overall stage I.
Presence of extranodal extension demonstrated a statistically significant but
modest negative effect on overall survival. CONDENSED ABSTRACT (2 SENTENCES):
Using NCDB data for validation, the AJCC 8th ed. pathologic staging system offers
much improved hazard discrimination and prognostication in HPV oropharyngeal
cancer, with the majority of cases reclassified as pStage I. Of note, only pN2
offered hazard discrimination within nodal staging and presence of pathologic
extranodal extension has a modest negative effect on survival.
