High-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infections cause cancers in different organ
sites, most commonly cervical and head and neck cancers. While carcinogenesis is 
initiated by two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, increasing evidence shows the
importance of specific somatic events in host cells for malignant transformation.
HPV-driven cancers share characteristic somatic changes, including apolipoprotein
B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-driven mutations and genomic
instability leading to copy number variations and large chromosomal
rearrangements. HPV-associated cancers have recurrent somatic mutations in
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)
and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), human leukocyte antigen A and B (HLA-A
and HLA-B)-A/B, and the transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) pathway, and
rarely have mutations in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) and RB transcriptional
corepressor 1 (RB1) tumor suppressor genes. There are some variations by tumor
site, such as NOTCH1 mutations which are primarily found in head and neck
cancers. Understanding the somatic events following HPV infection and persistence
can aid the development of early detection biomarkers, particularly when
mutations in precancers are characterized. Somatic mutations may also influence
prognosis and treatment decisions.
