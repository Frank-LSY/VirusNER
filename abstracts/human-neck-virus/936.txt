HNSCC is a heterogeneous group of tumors located in the oral cavity, oropharynx, 
hypopharynx and larynx. Originally, tobacco and alcohol exposures were the main
risk factors for HNSCC. In the last two decades, HPV infections have been
identified as a risk factor for HNSCC, especially for oropharyngeal tumors.
Whereas the HPV-induced oropharyngeal carcinomas predominantly express the HPV16 
related E6 and E7 oncoproteins, the HPV-negative HNSCC are associated with an
overexpression of p53. However, if the therapy successes for HPV-negative and
HPV-positive HNSCCs are compared, there are significantly higher total survival
rates for HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors compared to HPV-negative tumors. It
is important to understand this phenomenon in order to improve and adapt therapy 
concepts.
