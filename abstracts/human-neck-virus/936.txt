A variety of studies have been undertaken to improve classification of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In the past several years, it has become apparent that human papillomavirus is an important cause of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and likely represents a distinct mechanism of carcinogenesis compared to tobacco and alcohol-associated tumors. Human papillomavirus-associated tumors seem to have an improved prognosis, and may respond differently to treatment. Other markers such as epidermal growth factor receptor, p53, p16, and others have been extensively studied. Several of these proteins have been the targets of investigational drugs, and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are becoming an important weapon in our therapeutic arsenal.
