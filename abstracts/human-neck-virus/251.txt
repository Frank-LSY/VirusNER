The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is rising in
contrast to the decreasing incidence of carcinomas arising in other subsites of
the head and neck. The human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has played an
increasing role in these epidemiological changes and as the etiology for a
significant fraction of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, OPSCC in
particular. Most importantly, many retrospective studies have shown that the
prognosis differs significantly between patients with HPV-associated tumors and
non-HPV associated tumors. Thus, questions arise on the choices of treatment for 
patients based on HPV status and the consequences of therapy. Given the
recognized relevance of HPV status in OPSCC, many new questions concerning the
biology, treatment, and prevention of HPV infection arise. This review is
intended to highlight some of the major issues and frequently asked questions
relevant for the clinician dealing with patients with OPSCC.
