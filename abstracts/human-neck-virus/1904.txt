PURPOSE: Determine whether marital status is a significant predictor of survival 
in human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single center retrospective study included patients
diagnosed with human papilloma virus-positive oropharyngeal cancer at Boston
Medical Center between January 1, 2010 and December 30, 2015, and initiated
treatment with curative intent at Boston Medical Center. Demographic data and
tumor-related variables were recorded. Univariate analysis was performed using a 
two-sample t-test, chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and Kaplan Meier curves
with a log rank test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed using a Cox
regression model.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included in the study with 24 patients
described as married and 41 patients described as single. There was no
significant difference in most demographic variables or tumor related variables
between the two study groups, except single patients were significantly more
likely to have government insurance (p=0.0431). Furthermore, there was no
significant difference in 3-year overall survival between married patients and
single patients (married=91.67% vs single=87.80%; p=0.6532) or 3-year progression
free survival (married=79.17% vs single=85.37%; p=0.8136). After adjusting for
confounders including age, sex, race, insurance type, smoking status, treatment, 
and AJCC combined pathologic stage, marital status was not a significant
predictor of survival [HR=0.903; 95% CI (0.126,6.489); p=0.9192].
CONCLUSIONS: Although previous literature has demonstrated that married patients 
with head and neck cancer have a survival benefit compared to single patients
with head and neck cancer, we were unable to demonstrate the same survival
benefit in a cohort of patients with human papilloma virus-positive oropharyngeal
cancer.
