OBJECTIVE: To evaluate improvement of medical student knowledge of head and neck 
cancer (HNC) through participation in HNC screening fairs run by medical
students.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of surveys assessing medical students'
knowledge of HNC before and after volunteering at screening fairs.
SETTING: Four screening fairs held at the University of Miami Miller School of
Medicine during Oral, Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week.
SUBJECTS: Medical student screening fair volunteers.
METHODS: Four HNC screening fairs were organized by medical student volunteers.
All students completed a preevent survey assessing baseline knowledge and
participated in an otolaryngologist-led training session about HNC and the
screening examination. During the screening events, students educated guests
about HNC and performed physician-guided history and physical examinations.
Finally, students completed identical surveys 1 week and 3 months after the
event.
RESULTS: Thirty-four (n = 34) students completed the preevent surveys. At
baseline, 59%, 44%, and 24% named tobacco, alcohol, and human papilloma virus as 
risk factors, compared with 84%, 81%, and 69% on 3 month follow-up, respectively.
Out of 6 analyzed questions, the median total number of correctly answered
questions improved from 2 on pretest to 5 at 3 months (P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: Volunteer participation in a HNC screening program improves medical
students' knowledge of HNC risk factors and symptoms. This innovative approach to
students' education via participation and organization of screening events is a
useful method of improving their HNC knowledge.
