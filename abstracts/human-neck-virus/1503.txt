Treatment of patients with neck lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) from unknown primary tumor (NSCCUP) is challenging due to the risk of
missing occult tumors or inducing toxicity to unaffected sites. Human
papillomavirus (HPV) is a promising biomarker given its causal link to
oropharyngeal SCC and superior survival of patients with HPV-driven oropharyngeal
SCC and NSCCUP. Identification of HPV-driven NSCCUP could focus diagnostic
work-up and treatment on the oropharynx. For the first time, we assessed HPV
antibodies and their prognostic value in NSCCUP patients. Antibodies against E6
and E7 (HPV16/18/31/33/35), E1 and E2 (HPV16/18) were assessed in 46 NSCCUP
patients in sera collected at diagnosis, and in follow-up sera from five
patients. In 28 patients, HPV tumor status was determined using molecular markers
(HPV DNA, mRNA and cellular p16INK4a ). Thirteen (28%) NSCCUP patients were
HPV-seropositive for HPV16, 18, 31, or 33. Of eleven patients with HPV-driven
NSCCUP, ten were HPV-seropositive, while all 17 patients with non-HPV-driven
NSCCUP were HPV-seronegative, resulting in 91% sensitivity (95% CI: 59-100%) and 
100% specificity (95% CI: 80-100%). HPV antibody levels decreased after curative 
treatment. Recurrence was associated with increasing levels in an individual
case. HPV-seropositive patients had a better overall and progression-free
survival with hazard ratios of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.01-0.42) and 0.03 (95% CI:
0.002-0.18), respectively. For the first time, seropositivity to HPV proteins is 
described in NSCCUP patients, and high sensitivity and specificity for HPV-driven
NSCCUP are demonstrated. HPV seropositivity appears to be a reliable diagnostic
and prognostic biomarker for patients with HPV-driven NSCCUP.
