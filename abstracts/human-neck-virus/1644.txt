PURPOSE: To determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA can be detected in
the plasma of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) and to
monitor its temporal change during radiotherapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used polymerase chain reaction to detect HPV DNA in the
culture media of HPV-positive SCC90 and VU147T cells and the plasma of SCC90 and 
HeLa tumor-bearing mice, non-tumor-bearing controls, and those with HPV-negative 
tumors. We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify the 
plasma HPV DNA in 40 HPV-positive OPC, 24 HPV-negative head-and-neck cancer
patients and 10 non-cancer volunteers. The tumor HPV status was confirmed by
p16(INK4a) staining and HPV16/18 polymerase chain reaction or HPV in situ
hybridization. A total of 14 patients had serial plasma samples for HPV DNA
quantification during radiotherapy.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detectable in the plasma samples of SCC90- and HeLa-bearing 
mice but not in the controls. It was detected in 65% of the pretreatment plasma
samples from HPV-positive OPC patients using E6/7 quantitative polymerase chain
reaction. None of the HPV-negative head-and-neck cancer patients or non-cancer
controls had detectable HPV DNA. The pretreatment plasma HPV DNA copy number
correlated significantly with the nodal metabolic tumor volume (assessed using
(18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography). The serial measurements in 14
patients showed a rapid decline in HPV DNA that had become undetectable at
radiotherapy completion. In 3 patients, the HPV DNA level had increased to a
discernable level at metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Xenograft studies indicated that plasma HPV DNA is released from
HPV-positive tumors. Circulating HPV DNA was detectable in most HPV-positive OPC 
patients. Thus, plasma HPV DNA might be a valuable tool for identifying relapse.
