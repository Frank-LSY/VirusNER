A case of primary mucosal CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of
the head and neck rarely involving epiglottis in a 59-year-old male was reported.
Histologically, the ulcerative mucosa was affected by sheets of mixed
inflammatory infiltration, with scattered large atypical lymphoid cells arranging
in an individual or small clusters with focal epidermotropism.
Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were uniformly immunoreactive to antibodies
against CD2, CD3, CD7, CD43, CD4, TIA-1, with a heterogeneous expression of CD30,
but negative for CD20, CD79a, CD21, CD8, CD56, ALK, EMA, granzyme B. Epstein-Barr
virus encoded RNA (EBER) were detected. Genetically, T-cell receptor (TCR) Î³ gene
showed an oligoclonal rearrangement. This first case developing in epiglottis
demonstrates mucosal CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are
characteristic of a broad clinicopathologic spectrum similar to the counterpart
in the skin with a favorable prognosis.
