Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and especially oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma is a very significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The majors risk
factors of these tumors are tobacco smoking, chewing and alcohol consumption. But
there is a group, non-drinking and non-smoking, patients with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma. In these patients may be oral-genital contact and human 
papillomavirus infection the major risk factor for oral carcinogenesis. Aim of
this review is to point out this fact in correlation with clinical studies and
clinical conclusion for medical practice (Fig. 1, Ref. 32).
