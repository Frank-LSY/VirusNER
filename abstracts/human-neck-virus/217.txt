Carcinoma of the head and neck is the 6th cause of death by cancer in the world. 
In recent decades the human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implicated in the
etiology of this disease.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the types of HPV detected in 
the oral mucosa in women with cytological abnormalities suggesting
intraepithelial squamous lesions in the uterine cervix.
METHODS: Four-hundred-nine cervical-vaginal and oral pap-smears of women interned
in a Female Prison in São Paulo were examined. The relationship between cervical 
and oral lesion was analyzed by PCR/RFLP and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Of 27 (6.67%) specimens showing cervical cytological abnormalities
suggesting LSIL and HSIL, 22 (81.48%) had oncogenic high-risk HPV infection, of
which HPV 59 was the most prevalent. Three (11.1%) samples showed cytological
changes suggesting mild dysplasia in the oral cavity.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests an association between carcinoma of the oral
cavity and HPV infection, regardless of the virus type.
