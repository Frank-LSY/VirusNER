Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive head and neck cancer
characterized by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and dense lymphocyte
infiltration. The scarcity of NPC genomic data hinders the understanding of NPC
biology, disease progression and rational therapy design. Here we performed
whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 111 micro-dissected EBV-positive NPCs, with 15
cases subjected to further whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to determine its
mutational landscape. We identified enrichment for genomic aberrations of
multiple negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, including CYLD, TRAF3, NFKBIA 
and NLRC5, in a total of 41% of cases. Functional analysis confirmed inactivating
CYLD mutations as drivers for NPC cell growth. The EBV oncoprotein latent
membrane protein 1 (LMP1) functions to constitutively activate NF-κB signalling, 
and we observed mutual exclusivity among tumours with somatic NF-κB pathway
aberrations and LMP1-overexpression, suggesting that NF-κB activation is selected
for by both somatic and viral events during NPC pathogenesis.
