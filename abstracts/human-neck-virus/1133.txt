Introduction:Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are prevalent amongst chronic
rhinosinusitis (CRS) sufferers. Many P. aeruginosa strains form biofilms, leading
to treatment failure. Lytic bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect,
replicate within, and lyse bacteria, causing bacterial death. Aim: To assess the 
activity of a phage cocktail in eradicating biofilms of ex vivo P.aeruginosa
isolates from CRS patients. Methods: P. aeruginosa isolates from CRS patients
with and without cystic fibrosis (CF) across three continents were multi-locus
sequence typed and tested for antibiotic resistance. Biofilms grown in vitro were
treated with a cocktail of four phages (CT-PA). Biofilm biomass was measured
after 24 and 48 h, using a crystal violet assay. Phage titrations were performed 
to confirm replication of the phages. A linear mixed effects model was applied to
assess the effects of treatment, time, CF status, and multidrug resistance on the
biomass of the biofilm. Results: The isolates included 44 strain types. CT-PA
treatment significantly reduced biofilm biomass at both 24 and 48 h
post-treatment (p < 0.0001), regardless of CF status or antibiotic resistance.
Biomass was decreased by a median of 76% at 48 h. Decrease in biofilm was
accompanied by a rise in phage titres for all except one strain. Conclusion: A
single dose of phages is able to significantly reduce biofilms formed in vitro by
a range of P.aeruginosa isolates from CRS patients. This represents an exciting
potential and novel targeted treatment for P. aeruginosa biofilm infections and
multidrug resistant bacteria.
