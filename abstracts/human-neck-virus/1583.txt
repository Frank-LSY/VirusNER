CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially by HPV 16, is
frequently detected in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The
expression of viral oncoproteins in tumoral tissues of OSCCs suggests the
implication of HPV in tumorogenesis. It should now be systematically detected and
considered in each patient's treatment and outcome.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of HPV infection, the oncogenic role of
HPV in patients from the South-East of France with head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), and the resulting clinical implications.
METHODS: Biopsy samples from 200 patients with HNSCC were analyzed. For each
patient, one or two biopsies of tumoral tissue were analyzed simultaneously with 
a biopsy of healthy tissue. Fresh frozen tissues were tested by molecular
techniques for HPV DNA detection and genotyping as well as mRNA expression of
oncoproteins E6 and E7. Expression of p16 was also analyzed by
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: HPV DNA tested positive in 11.5% of biopsy samples. The HPV prevalence
was higher in OSCCs (91.3 vs 27.3, p < 0.0001) and in patients not consuming
tobacco (65.2% vs 95.4%, p < 0.0001). The estimated 3-year overall survival rates
were 67.0% for HPV-infected patients versus 39.9% for non-infected patients. The 
high-risk HPV 16 was the most common type detected (65.2%). In 12 of 18 patients 
exhibiting DNA of high-risk HPV in their tumor tissue, the same viral genome was 
also present in normal tissue. E6 and E7 expression was found in 9 of 14 tumoral 
biopsies tested for these markers.
