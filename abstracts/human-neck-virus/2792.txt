OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine atypical and malignant papillary oral
lesions for low- and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and to
correlate HPV infection with clinical and pathologic features.
STUDY DESIGN: Sections of 28 atypical papillary lesions (APLs) and 14 malignant
papillary lesions (MPLs) were examined for HPV by in situ hybridization and for
p16 and MIB-1 by immunohistochemistry; 24 conventional papillomas were studied
for comparison.
RESULTS: Low-risk HPV was found in 10 of 66 cases, including 9 APLs and 1
papilloma. All low-risk HPV-positive cases showed suprabasilar MIB-1 staining,
and the agreement was statistically significant (P < .0001). Diffuse p16 staining
combined with high-risk HPV was not seen in any of the cases. A subset of HPV(-) 
APLs progressed to carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral papillary lesions are a heterogeneous group. Low-risk HPV
infection is associated with a subset of APLs with a benign clinical course.
Potentially malignant APLs and MPLs are not associated with low- or high-risk
HPV.
