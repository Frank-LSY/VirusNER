BACKGROUND: Multifocal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection into the palatine and
pharyngeal tonsils, which might be linked to a second primary tumor of
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), was investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and five patients with various head and neck
diseases including 14 patients with OPC were enrolled in this study. Swabs from
the palatine and pharyngeal tonsils were collected in each individual, and
auto-nested GP5+/GP6+ PCR for HPV DNA was performed.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in the palatine tonsil or the pharyngeal tonsil in 
a small subset of upper respiratory tract cancer other than OPC (URTC) and
non-cancer diseases. Furthermore, HPV DNA was detected in both the palatine and
pharyngeal tonsils in the same individual in 2 of 48 (4%) URTC cases, and 1 of 43
(2%) non-cancer cases. On the other hand, p16-positive OPC cases demonstrated a
higher HPV DNA detection rate (4 of 9, 44.4%) compared with other disease groups.
CONCLUSION: HPV DNA detection in both the palatine and pharyngeal tonsils in the 
same individual, especially in HPV-OPC, suggested the ability of HPV to infect
tonsillar tissues of Waldeyer's ring multifocally.
