AIMS: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a causative agent for
approximately 5% of all new cancer cases in humans. The virus is detected in
cervical, anal, vaginal, penile, vulvar and head and neck cancers and has
prognostic implications. Thus, test systems are required to detect high-risk but 
also low-risk HPV subtypes with high specificity and sensitivity in a
time-effective and cost-effective manner. In the present study we developed a new
mass spectrometry (MS)-based test system for the detection of HPV infections in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.
METHODS: A high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of
flight MS-based assay was applied to genotype 19 HPV types in FFPE tissue
specimens (n=46). The results from the MS assay were compared with the results
obtained from two hybridisation-based test systems: the HPV 3.5 LCD-array kit and
the EuroArrayHPV system.
RESULTS: In 36 out of 46 (78%) tissue samples, a HPV infection could be detected 
by the MS-based HPV assay. In 16 samples (44%) only one and in 20 samples (56%)
two to six HPV subtypes were identified. The overall agreement of all three
assays was almost perfect (Cohen's k value: 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: The MS-based assay is highly sensitive, reliable as well as
cost-effective and represents a suitable technology for the detection of HPV
infections in FFPE tissue material.
