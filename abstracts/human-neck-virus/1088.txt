The current TNM staging for oropharyngeal cancer (OSCC) was designed empirically 
for non-HPV-related disease. Emerging evidence suggests it is unsuited for Human 
papillomavirus (HPV)-related OSCC. Patients with HPV-positive tumors have
improved prognosis, despite presenting at advanced stages. These shortcomings of 
the current staging system have been identified in single- and
multi-institutional trials. Patients with HPV related OSCC typically present with
advanced N-stages leading to higher stage groupings. A rarity of stages I and II 
therefore represents the nature of HPV-related OSCC. Concerning prognosis of the 
patients, N-category and extracapsular spread seem to be of minor importance,
whereas advanced T-stages result in unfavourable outcome. Anatomical staging
therefore has been implied into different proposals to prognostic risk
classifications in HPV-related disease as an additive compound. Prognostic risk
groupings are further enhanced by incorporating non-anatomical factors. To
summarize, it can be suggested that the current TNM system alone has little
prognostic value in HPV-related OSCC.
