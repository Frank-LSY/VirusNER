Data were collected on patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma from 2001 to 2014. Nodal status was determined by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or surgical pathology when available. Survival rates and associations between HPV status and demographic/tumor characteristics were assessed.
