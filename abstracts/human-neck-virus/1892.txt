The nature and extent of immune cell infiltration into solid tumours are key
determinants of therapeutic response. Here, using a DNA methylation-based
approach to tumour cell fraction deconvolution, we report the integrated analysis
of tumour composition and genomics across a wide spectrum of solid cancers.
Initially studying head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we identify two
distinct tumour subgroups: 'immune hot' and 'immune cold', which display
differing prognosis, mutation burden, cytokine signalling, cytolytic activity and
oncogenic driver events. We demonstrate the existence of such tumour subgroups
pan-cancer, link clonal-neoantigen burden to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration,
and show that transcriptional signatures of hot tumours are selectively engaged
in immunotherapy responders. We also find that treatment-naive hot tumours are
markedly enriched for known immune-resistance genomic alterations, potentially
explaining the heterogeneity of immunotherapy response and prognosis seen within 
this group. Finally, we define a catalogue of mediators of active antitumour
immunity, deriving candidate biomarkers and potential targets for precision
immunotherapy.
