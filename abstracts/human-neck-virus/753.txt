Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) proteins are cellular DNA/RNA-editing enzymes that play pivotal roles in the innate immune response to viral infection. APOBEC3 (A3) proteins were reported to hypermutate the genome of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16), the causative agent of cervical cancer. However, hypermutation did not affect viral DNA maintenance, leaving the exact role of A3 against HPV infection elusive. Here we examine whether A3 proteins affect the virion assembly using an HPV16 pseudovirion (PsV) production system, in which PsVs are assembled from its capsid proteins L1/L2 encapsidating a reporter plasmid in 293FT cells. We found that co-expression of A3A or A3C in 293FT cells greatly reduced the infectivity of PsV. The reduced infectivity of PsV assembled in the presence of A3A, but not A3C, was attributed to the decreased copy number of the encapsidated reporter plasmid. On the other hand, A3C, but not A3A, efficiently bound to L1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays, which suggests that this physical interaction may lead to reduced infectivity of PsV assembled in the presence of A3C. These results provide mechanistic insights into A3s' inhibitory effects on the assembly phase of the HPV16 virion.
