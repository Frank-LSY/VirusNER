Primary nasal lymphomas are rare. One of the most common cellular subtypes in the
Asian population is natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) with a high
association of EBV. We report a case of a 42-year-old female, who presented with 
a worsening sore throat, odynophagia, dysphagia to solid food due to
oropharyngeal ulcers and bilateral nasal blockage and recurrent fever for the
past two weeks prior to admission. Physical examination revealed ulcers over the 
soft palate with nasopharyngeal slough. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the 
neck showed nasopharyngeal abscess with bilateral maxillary ethnoidal sinusitis. 
The diagnostic and management challenge is discussed.
