PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck cancer
(HNC) have a better prognosis relative to other types of HNC, making survivorship
an emerging and critical issue. Exercise is a core component of survivorship
care, but little is known about how many survivors of HPV-related HNC can safely 
be advised to start exercising on their own, as opposed to needing further
evaluation or supervised exercise.
METHODS: We utilized guidelines to identify health issues that would indicate
value of further evaluation prior to being safely prescribed unsupervised
exercise. We performed a retrospective chart review of 150 patients with
HPV-related HNC to assess health issues 6 months after completing definitive
therapy. Patients with at least one health issue were deemed appropriate to
receive further evaluation prior to prescription for unsupervised exercise. We
utilized logistic regression to identify clinical and demographic factors
associated with the need for further evaluation, likely performed by outpatient
rehabilitation clinicians.
RESULTS: In this cohort of patients, 39.3% could safely be prescribed
unsupervised exercise 6 months after completing definitive therapy. On
multivariable regression, older age, BMI >30, and receipt of radiation were
associated with an increased likelihood for requiring further evaluation or
supervised exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Over half of patients with HPV-related HNC would benefit from
referral to physical therapy or an exercise professional for further evaluation
to determine the most appropriate level of exercise supervision, based upon
current guidelines.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Development of such referral systems will be
essential to enhance survivorship outcomes for patients who have completed
treatment.
