PURPOSE: To assess risk factors of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma in the Munich area of Southern Germany in relation to human
papillomavirus (HPV) association of the tumors. To demonstrate differences in
tumor characteristics and their impact on adjuvant treatment.
METHODS: Between November 2010 and July 2013, patients were prospectively
interviewed for risk factors before they underwent surgical resection of their
tumors. HPV association was evaluated by p16 immunohistochemistry; tumor
characteristics and type of adjuvant treatment were recorded. Follow-up data were
collected after a median follow-up of 12.1 month.
RESULTS: In contrast to many recent studies, we could not detect any difference
in overall age and age at sexual debut between p16-positive and p16-negative
patients. P16-negative patients are characterized by a more intensive tobacco and
alcohol use, a more abusive way of consumption, less nonoral and less oral sex
partners. P16-positive patients had a significantly higher risk of lymph node
metastases, but nevertheless a significant lower risk to recur or to die. No
difference in the incidence of synchronous second primary tumors was seen.
P16-positive patients generally received a more aggressive adjuvant treatment
because of more frequently involved lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: Lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, drinking, and sexual habits
were independent from age, but showed marked differences between the p16-positive
and p16-negative group. Since p16-positive patients were treated more
aggressively, it is not possible to distinguish whether the better outcome of
HPV-positive patients is a result of less aggressive cancers or more aggressive
treatment. With regard to the ongoing debate about treatment deintensification,
we should keep in mind that the survival of HPV-positive cancer patients is not
100 %.
