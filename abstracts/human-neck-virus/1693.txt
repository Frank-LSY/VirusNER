Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs) are deadly and common cancers. Recent genomic studies implicate multiple
genetic pathways, including cell signaling, cell cycle and immune evasion, in
their development. Here we analyze public data sets and uncover a previously
unappreciated role of epigenome deregulation in the genesis of 13% of
HPV-negative HNSCCs. Specifically, we identify novel recurrent mutations encoding
p.Lys36Met (K36M) alterations in multiple H3 histone genes. histones. We further 
validate the presence of these alterations in multiple independent HNSCC data
sets and show that, along with previously described NSD1 mutations, they
correspond to a specific DNA methylation cluster. The K36M substitution and NSD1 
defects converge on altering methylation of histone H3 at K36 (H3K36),
subsequently blocking cellular differentiation and promoting oncogenesis. Our
data further indicate limited redundancy for NSD family members in HPV-negative
HNSCCs and suggest a potential role for impaired H3K36 methylation in their
development. Further investigation of drugs targeting chromatin regulators is
warranted in HPV-negative HNSCCs driven by aberrant H3K36 methylation.
