This review examines the general cellular and molecular underpinnings of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related carcinogenesis in the context of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and focuses on HPV-positive oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma in areas for which specific data is available. It covers 
the major pathways dysregulated in HPV-positive HNSCC and the genome-wide changes
associated with this disease.
