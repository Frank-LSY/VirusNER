Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are estimated to be the most common
sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Meanwhile, it is well established that
infection by high-risk HPVs is considered the major cause of cervical cancer
since more than 96% of these cancers are positive for high-risk HPVs, especially 
types 16 and 18. Moreover, during the last 2 decades, numerous studies
pointed-out the possible involvement of high-risk HPV in several human carcinomas
including head and neck, colorectal and breast cancers. The association between
high-risk HPVs and cervical cancer and potentially other human malignancies would
necessitate the introduction of vaccines which were generated against the 2 most 
frequent high-risk HPVs (types 16 and 18) worldwide, including the Middle East
(ME) as well as North African countries. The presence of high-risk HPVs in the
pathogenesis of human cancers in the ME, which is essential in order to evaluate 
the importance of vaccination against HPVs, has not been fully investigated yet. 
In this review, we present an overview of the existing epidemiological evidence
regarding the presence of HPV in human cancers in the ME and the potential impact
of vaccination against HPV infections and its outcome on human health in this
region.
