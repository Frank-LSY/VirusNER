OBJECTIVE: To review the available evidence and make recommendations regarding
use of systemically administered drugs in combination or in sequence with
radiation (RT) and/or surgery for cure and/or organ preservation in patients with
locally advanced nonmetastatic (Stage III to IVB) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (LASCCHN).
METHOD: Recognizing the Meta-analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer
(MACH-NC) group reports have de facto guided practice since 2000, we searched for
systematic reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews published from January 2000 to February 2015 in reference to 4 research
questions. A search was also conducted for randomized trials (RCTs) up to
February 2015 not included in the meta-analyses.
RESULT: The MACH-NC reports, 5 additional meta-analyses, and 30 RCTs not included
by MACH-NC were identified. For chemotherapy, MACH-NC findings showing improved
overall survival with concomitant chemoRT did not require modification. High-dose
cisplatin was most commonly studied. We confirmed this benefit with cisplatin
monotherapy in patients treated with with postoperative concurrent chemoRT. Other
than cetuximab, no targeted agents and radiosensitizers studied in RCTs were
shown effective. TPF induction chemotherapy was superior to PF for tumor response
and larynx preservation but not survival. Larynx preservation was reported with
both CRT and induction chemotherapy approaches.
CONCLUSION: ChemoRT with cisplatin at least 40 mg/m2 per week given as radical or
postoperative adjuvant remains a standard treatment approach for LASCCHN that
improves overall survival but increases toxicity. 5-FU plus platinum is supported
by less data but may be a reasonable alternative for patients unsuitable for
cisplatin. Of note, stratification of outcomes by HPV-status was not available
but outcomes for oropharynx cancer appeared similar to other subsites in chemoRT 
RCTs. No RCTs have yet demonstrated superiority or non-inferiority of
cetuximab-RT to CRT. In view of this, cetuximab-RT is suggested only for patients
not candidates for CRT. Taxane-based triplet induction chemotherapy is superior
to doublets for rapid tumour downsizing and for larynx preservation, but does not
improve overall survival and should be used with primary G-CSF prophylaxis.
Further investigation of induction approaches for larynx preservation may be
warranted.
