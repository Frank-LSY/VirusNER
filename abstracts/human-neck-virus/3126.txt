BACKGROUND: Dengue is an arboviral infection classically presenting with fever,
arthralgia, headache, and rashes. It is hyperendemic in Sri Lanka and has a major
impact on health. Neurological complications of dengue fever are rare but have
been reported in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old Sri Lankan man presented with a history of
fever, arthralgia, and generalized malaise of 2 days duration. A diagnosis of
dengue was confirmed with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and positive NS1 antigen 
done on day 2 without evidence of hemoconcentration. On admission, our patient
had weakness of the bilateral lower limbs, which progressed in an ascending
pattern involving both upper limbs and neck muscles, requiring assisted
ventilation. Electromyography confirmed a demyelinating polyneuropathy and
cerebrospinal fluid showed albumincytological dissociation. He was treated with
intravenous immunoglobulins and made an uneventful recovery. Subsequently, his
immunoglobulin M test result for dengue virus was positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare but possible neurological sequel
following dengue fever. In regions where dengue is hyperendemic, screening for
dengue illness may be important in patients presenting with acute flaccid
paralysis.
