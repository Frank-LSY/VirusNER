BACKGROUND: FOXA1 is a major transcription factor involved in the action of human
papilloma virus (HPV). However, it has been never studied in HPV-associated
tumors.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate its expression in cervical and head and neck
tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 63 cervical carcinomas/dysplasias and 152 head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) were immunohistochemically studied for the
expression of FOXA1.
RESULTS: 63.1% of cervical SCC and 40.7% of endocervical adenocarcinomas strongly
expressed FOXA1. Most (90%) pre-invasive lesions (CIN3 and in situ
adenocarcinomas) strongly expressed FOXA1 and this difference from invasive
lesions was statistically significant (p=0.005). No association with
clinicopathological factors was found. 51.3% of HNSCC expressed FOXA1. In these
tumors, FOXA1 expression was associated with the non-keratinizing morphology but 
not with the HPV/p16 status neither other clinicopathological features. Of normal
structures, salivary glands, endocervical glands and basal/parabasal cell layer
of squamous epithelium of both uterine cervix and head and neck mucosa, all
strongly expressed FOXA1.
CONCLUSION: FOXA1 is expressed by basal cells of squamous epithelium,
pre-invasion lesions of the uterine cervix and the head/neck and almost half
invasive cervical and head/neck carcinomas, supporting its possible implication
in HPV pathogenesis.
