BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers have been associated with 
different demographic profiles and disease characteristics than HPV-unrelated
cancers in head and neck patients, but distress and other symptoms have not been 
compared. The aim of this study was to assess whether distress levels, fatigue,
pain, anxiety, depression, and common psychological and practical problems differ
between head and neck cancer patients with HPV-related vs. HPV-unrelated
carcinomas (using oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) and non-OPC cancers as surrogates
for HPV status).
METHODS: Distress, depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, and common problems were
examined in 56 OPC and 90 non-OPC patients at 4 timepoints during the first year 
following diagnosis. Two-level hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine
effects.
RESULTS: The HPV-related OPC group was more likely to be younger (p = 0.05),
Caucasian (p = 0.001), non-smokers (p = 0.01), earn more (p = 0.04), and present 
with more advanced stage (p < 0.0001). At baseline, OPC patients reported only
higher pain scores (p = 0.01) than non-OPC patients. Total problems decreased
more in the OPC group (p = 0.08) than the non-OPC group from baseline to 12-month
follow-up. In both groups, scores on distress, depression, psychosocial problems,
and practical problems decreased similarly over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a difference in the clinico-demographic characteristics of
HPV-related vs. HPV-unrelated patients, only baseline pain levels and total
problems over time differed between the two groups.
