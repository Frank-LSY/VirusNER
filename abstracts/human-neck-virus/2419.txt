BACKGROUND: The p53 pathway plays a critical role in maintaining genomic
stability and preventing tumor formation. Given the roles of both MDM4 and HPV16 
E6 oncoproteins in inhibition of p53 activity, we tested the hypothesis that MDM4
polymorphisms are associated with the risk of HPV16-associated squamous cell
carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).
METHODS: Genotyping was conducted on 3 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms
(rs11801299 G>A, rs10900598 G>T, and rs1380576 C>G) in MDM4, and serology was
used to determine HPV 16 exposure in 380 cases and 335 cancer-free controls that 
were frequency-matched by age, sex, smoking, and drinking status.
RESULTS: None of 3 MDM4 polymorphisms alone was significantly associated with
risk of overall SCCHN. With further analysis stratified by HPV16 serology and
tumor site, we found that each polymorphism individually modified the risk of
HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP), and such
effect modification was particularly pronounced in never smokers and never
drinkers.
CONCLUSION: The risk of HPV16-associated SCCOP could be modified by MDM4
polymorphisms. Large and prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.
