Here, we describe a multiplexed immunohistochemical platform with computational
image processing workflows, including image cytometry, enabling simultaneous
evaluation of 12 biomarkers in one formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
section. To validate this platform, we used tissue microarrays containing 38
archival head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and revealed differential immune 
profiles based on lymphoid and myeloid cell densities, correlating with human
papilloma virus status and prognosis. Based on these results, we investigated 24 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas from patients who received neoadjuvant GVAX
vaccination and revealed that response to therapy correlated with degree of
mono-myelocytic cell density and percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing T cell
exhaustion markers. These data highlight the utility of in situ immune monitoring
for patient stratification and provide digital image processing pipelines to the 
community for examining immune complexity in precious tissue sections, where
phenotype and tissue architecture are preserved to improve biomarker discovery
and assessment.
