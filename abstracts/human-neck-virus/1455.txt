BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an infectious agent that has been
associated with human cancer. We have updated the U.S. population sero-prevalence
using a large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sample of
adults from 2003 to 2010, and have analysed the associations between HPV
seropositivity and self-reported history of cancer.
METHODS: Four cross-sectional cycles (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and
2009-2010) were used, for a total of 12â€‰759 participants who had both cancer
history and HPV serum information.
RESULTS: The sero-prevalences of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 15.0%, 4.8%,
11.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. Females had significantly higher HPV prevalence
than males (P<0.05) for all subtypes. Positive associations between HPV 16/18
seropositivity and lifetime history of any cancer (adjusted odds
ratio-ORadj=1.68; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.01), history of any of eight selected cancers
(ORadj=2.63; 95% CI: 1.78, 3.90), lung cancer (ORadj=5.14; 95% CI: 1.29, 20.44), 
and cervical cancer (ORadj=2.55; 95% CI: 1.63, 3.98) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of significant associations between HPV 16/18
seropositivity and lifetime history of cancer adds epidemiological evidence to
the carcinogenicity potential of HPV 16 and 18 in other tissues. With increasing 
coverage of the HPV vaccine in the U.S., future NHANES data and sample collection
may allow further detailed evaluation of the population impact of the HPV
vaccination on cancer prevention.
