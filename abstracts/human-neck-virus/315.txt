[Immunotherapies for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas].

[Article in Chinese]

Yan XJ, Xu KL, Zhang XX.

The Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a group of heterogeneous
diseases. Patients with HNSCC demonstrate poor prognosis and survival time with
standard therapy, especially in patients with advanced HNSCC. Recurrence and
metastasis have not yet been effectively controlled. The immune profile in HNSCC,
whether caused by carcinogen exposure or human papillomavirus (HPV), showed
significantly immunosuppression. With the understanding of the complex
interaction between tumor and immune system and immune escape mechanism of HNSCC,
new immunotherapies have been generating. This article will summarize the
immunological mechanism and immune therapy of HNSCC currently..
