AIMS: To assess differences in methylation profiles, and thus pathogenesis,
between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and negative nasopharyngeal carcinomas 
(NPCs). Also, promoter hypermethylation is a common phenomenon in early
carcinogenesis to inactivate tumour suppressor genes. Since epigenetic changes
are reversible, the therapeutic application of methylation inhibitors could
provide treatment options.
METHODS: We evaluated promoter hypermethylation profiles of 22 common tumour
suppressor genes in 108 NPCs using methylation-specific multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification. Correlation between methylation,
clinicopathological features (including EBV) and survival was examined. Cluster
analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Hypermethylation of RASSF1A and ESR1 was significantly more frequent in 
EBV-positive NPC, while hypermethylation of DAPK1 was more frequent in
EBV-negative NPC. In logistic regression, age, with EBV-positive NPC occurring at
earlier age, and RASSF1, with RASSF1 hypermethylation being more frequent in
EBV-positive NPC, remained significant. In EBV-positive NPC, hypermethylation of 
RASSF1A predicted worse overall survival (OS) (HR 3.058,95% CI 1.027 to 9.107).
In EBV-negative NPC, hypermethylated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was a
predictor of poor disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 6.868, 95% CI 2.142 to 22.022).
CONCLUSION: There are important epigenetic differences between EBV-negative and
EBV-positive NPCs, with EBV-negative NPC having a more similar hypermethylation
profile to other head and neck squamous cell carcinomas than EBV-positive NPC.
Hypermethylation of RASSF1A might contribute to worse OS in EBV-positive NPC, and
may be an important event in the pathogenesis of EBV-infected NPC.
Hypermethylation of APC might contribute to worse DFS in EBV-negative NPC.
