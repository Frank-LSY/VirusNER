IMPORTANCE: Human papillomaviruses are now recognized as an etiologic factor in a
growing subset of head and neck cancers and have critical prognostic importance
that affects therapeutic decision making. There is no universally accepted gold
standard for high-risk HPV (hrHPV) assessment in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, nor is there a clear understanding of 
the frequency or role of hrHPV in sites other than oropharynx.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal assessment of hrHPV in FFPE head and neck
tumor tissue specimens.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: In the setting of a large Midwestern referral
center, assessment of hrHPV by p16 immunohistochemical staining, in situ
hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-MassArray (PCR-MA), with L1
PGMY-PCR and sequencing to resolve method discordance, was conducted for 338 FFPE
oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and oral cavity tumor tissue specimens. Relative
sensitivity and specificity were compared to develop a standard optimal test
protocol. Tissue specimens were collected from 338 patients with head and neck
cancer treated during the period 2001 through 2011 in the departments of
Otolaryngology, Radiation Oncology, and Medical Oncology.
INTERVENTION: Patients received standard therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Optimal hrHPV identification, detection, and activity
in head and neck cancers.
RESULTS: Using combined PCR-MA with L1 PGMY-PCR and sequencing for conclusive
results, we found PCR-MA to have 99.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity, p16 to
have 94.2% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity, and in situ hybridization to have
82.9% sensitivity and 81.0% specificity. Among HPV-positive tumors, HPV16 was
most frequently detected, but 10 non-HPV16 types accounted for 6% to 50% of
tumors, depending on the site. Overall, 86% of oropharynx, 50% of nasopharynx,
and 26% of oral cavity tumors were positive for hrHPV.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PCR-MA has a low DNA (5 ng) requirement effective for 
testing small tissue samples; high throughput; and rapid identification of HPV
types, with high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-MA together with p16INK4a
provided accurate assessment of HPV presence, type, and activity and was
determined to be the best approach for HPV testing in FFPE head and neck tumor
tissue specimens.
