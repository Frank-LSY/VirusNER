PURPOSE: Although p16 protein expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is recognized as a prognostic marker in
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), its prevalence and significance
have not been well established in cancer of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, or
larynx, collectively referred as non-OPSCC, where HPV infection is less common
than in the oropharynx.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: p16 expression and high-risk HPV status in non-OPSCCs from 
RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and in situ hybridization (ISH). Hazard ratios from Cox models were expressed as 
positive or negative, stratified by trial, and adjusted for clinical
characteristics.
RESULTS: p16 expression was positive in 14.1% (12 of 85), 24.2% (23 of 95), and
19.0% (27 of 142) and HPV ISH was positive in 6.5% (six of 93), 14.6% (15 of
103), and 6.9% (seven of 101) of non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522
studies, respectively. Hazard ratios for p16 expression were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.42
to 0.95; P = .03) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89; P = .01) for progression-free
(PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Comparing OPSCC and non-OPSCC,
patients with p16-positive OPSCC have better PFS and OS than patients with
p16-positive non-OPSCC, but patients with p16-negative OPSCC and non-OPSCC have
similar outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Similar to results in patients with OPSCC, patients with p16-negative
non-OPSCC have worse outcomes than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, and HPV 
may also have a role in outcome in a subset of non-OPSCC. However, further
development of a p16 IHC scoring system in non-OPSCC and improvement of HPV
detection methods are warranted before broad application in the clinical setting.
