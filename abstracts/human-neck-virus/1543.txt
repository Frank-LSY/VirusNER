OBJECTIVE: To construct a recombinant adenovirus of survivin vector and provid
valuable reference for gene therapy of laryngeal cancer.
METHODS: The survivin gene was cloned by PCR. After confirmation by enzyme
restriction analysis and sequencing, the gene and the adenovirus vector were
recombined together to construct the recombinant adenovirus vector. The
recombinant adenovirus vector was confirmed via both sequencing and digestion
restriction analysis, and then linearized and transfected into the HEK 293 cell
line to generate recombinant adenovirus.
RESULTS: The sequence analysis demonstrated that the survivin gene sequence was
the same as published in the literature, suggesting that a recombinant adenovirus
vector has been successfully constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: A survivin recombinant adenovirus has been successfully constructed.
