Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, highly aggressive skin tumour. In 2008, a 
Merkel cell polyomavirus (MC) was identified in MCCs as a potential etiological
factor of MCC. The aims of this retrospective study were to investigate the
epidemiological, clinicopathological and virological features of MCCs. Between
2007 and 2012, 11 patients had been diagnosed with MCC by histological methods in
University of Pécs, Hungary. In eight MCC cases MC was tested by PCR (in primary 
skin lesions, lymph nodes/cutan metastases, MCC neighboring carcinomas).
Clinicopathological characteristics (age, histological pattern, lymphovascular
invasion, co-morbidities) of MC-positive and MC-negative cases were compared. MC 
was detected in three (37.5%) out of eight patients' primary tumour or
metastasis. The average age was 73.8 (64.3 in MC-positive group). Except the
youngest, 55 year-old patient (the primary tumour appeared on his leg), all
tumours were found at the head and neck region. Immunosuppression (steroid
therapy, chronic lymphoid leukaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
and/or old age were characteristic for all cases. Histological pattern was
different in MC-positive and in MC-negative groups: MCCs with MC showed more
homogeneous histological pattern, lack of lymphovascular invasion and were
associated with better prognosis (mortality rate: 33% versus 80%). MCC associated
with oncogenic virus is a newly recognized clinical entity. However, MC could not
be detected in all histologically proven MCCs. The well-defined selection of
patients/disease groups and better characterization of differences between
MC-positive and negative cases is an important step towards the recognition of
the etiology and pathogenesis of all MCCs.
