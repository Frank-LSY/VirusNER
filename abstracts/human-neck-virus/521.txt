Overall, 54.8% of all tested samples contained at least one beta-PV type. Even though the correlation between types found in lavage and tissue specimens from cancer patients was low, there was a large statistically significant difference between oropharyngeal cancer patients and matched controls for HPV5 (P=0.003; OR=15.58) and between both oral (P=0.026; OR=5.7) and oropharyngeal cancer patients (P=0.002; OR=25.5) and controls for HPV122. In addition, there was no correlation between the prevalence of alpha and beta-PVs in the study patients.
