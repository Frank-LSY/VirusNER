Accumulating evidence suggests that persistent human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection is closely related to the risk of certain types of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma types, including laryngeal cancer (LC). Some reports
indicated a higher HPV prevalence in Chinese LC patients, which remains to be
established due to small study sample sizes. The aim of this study was to
estimate the HPV infection rate in Chinese LC patients and assess the LC risk
conferred by high-risk subtype HPV infection by meta-analysis. We searched
MEDLINE, the Embase Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang 
Database, and VIP Database for studies published in either English or Chinese up 
to October 2013, and systematically reviewed 28 original research articles that
met the inclusion criteria. Both the HPV infection rate in the LC group (all 28
studies) and the LC risk from high-risk HPV infection (a subgroup of 12
case-control studies) were analyzed by R 3.0 software. Overall HPV, HPV-16/18,
and HPV-6/11 infection rates were 32 % (95 % CI 22-44 %), 30 % (95 % CI 24-37 %),
and 12 % (95 % CI 9-17 %), respectively. There was a strong association between
high-risk HPV-16/18 infection and LC (P < 0.01; OR = 8.07, 95 % CI 5.67-11.48).
Our research indicates that there is a higher HPV prevalence in Chinese LC
patients compared to LC patients outside of China and that HPV infection
significantly increases LC risk.
