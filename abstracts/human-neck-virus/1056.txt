BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck cancer are at high risk for second
primary malignancies. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven tumors are generally
high-grade oropharyngeal cancers. We analyzed the incidence of second primary
malignancy of the head and neck in patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) of the head and neck and temporal trends in the HPV era.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was
queried for patients with SCC of the head and neck (range, 1973-2008). Cumulative
incidence rates of second primary malignancy of the head and neck were compared
based on competing risk analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 104,639 cases were included in this study, of which 4616
patients had second primary malignancy of the head and neck. Oropharyngeal cancer
incidence increased over time. Estimated incidence rate/10,000 person-years
(105.5, 80.6, and 50.2 for 1973-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2008, respectively) and
cumulative incidence rates (10-year rates of 6.68%, 5.72%, and 4.59% for
1973-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2008, respectively) of second primary malignancies
of the head and neck for patients with oropharyngeal cancer decreased over time
(p < .001). The second primary malignancy of the head and neck incidence rate was
significantly lower in patients with high-grade oropharyngeal cancer from 2000 to
2008 (30.3 vs 65.5 and 54.6 from 1973-1989 and 1990-1999, respectively;
p < .001).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of second primary malignancy of the head and neck in
patients with head and neck cancer has decreased over time. This is driven by
lower rates in patients with high-grade oropharyngeal cancer, is temporally
related with increases in HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, and suggests that 
incidence rates of second primary malignancy of the head and neck may be lower
for HPV-associated cancer. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:
