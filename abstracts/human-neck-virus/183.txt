Viruses that selectively replicate in cancer cells, leading to the death of the
cell, are being studied for their potential as cancer therapies. Some of these
viruses are naturally occurring but cause little if any illness in humans; others
have been engineered to make them specifically able to kill cancer cells while
sparing normal cells. These oncolytic viruses may be selective for cancer cells
because viral receptors are over-expressed on the surface of cancer cells or
because antiviral pathways are distorted in cancer cells. Additionally, when
oncolytic viruses kill cancer cells, it can stimulate an antitumour immune
response from the host that can enhance efficacy. Numerous early phase trials of 
at least six oncolytic viruses have been reported with no evidence of concerning 
toxicity either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapies and
radiotherapy. Three oncolytic viruses have reached randomized testing in cancer
patients; reolysin in head and neck cancer and JX594 in hepatocellular cancers,
while results from the first-phase III trial of T-vec in metastatic melanoma are 
expected shortly.
