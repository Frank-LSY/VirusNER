Scleredema adultorum is a rare condition characterised by progressive collagen
and mucin deposition in the skin. While the aetiology has not been clearly
delineated, the condition is often associated with common infections. The current
report describes a previously healthy 16-year-old boy who presented with 3 weeks 
of progressive neck swelling and skin induration. He had evidence of both active 
streptococcal and Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. Skin biopsy confirmed the 
diagnosis of scleredema. The patient was treated for his streptococcal infection,
but otherwise managed conservatively. Clear improvement in the signs and symptoms
was seen at a 3-month follow-up appointment. Scleredema can be a complication of 
streptococcal infection but to our knowledge has not been reported in association
with EBV. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient
presenting with cutaneous/subcutaneous induration and swelling of the face and/or
neck.
