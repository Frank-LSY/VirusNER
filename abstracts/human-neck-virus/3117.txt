BACKGROUND: p16 expression is a well established biomarker of cervical dysplasia 
and carcinoma arising from high risk human papilloma virus infection. Increased
p16 expression is also seen in squamous neoplasms arising at other sites,
including head, neck, and oropharyngeal tract. Squamous lesions are also
frequently encountered at ocular surface and peri-orbital skin sites, but the
prevalence of increased p16 expression in these lesions has been poorly studied.
METHODS: We retrospectively surveyed 13 ocular surface and 16 orbital squamous
lesions biopsied at UC San Diego Healthcare System and VA San Diego Healthcare
System for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry. These cases included ocular
surface lesions with diagnoses of conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) and
squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Peri-orbital eyelid biopsies included lesions
with diagnoses of SCCis and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. We performed
multivariate logistic regression, followed by student's T-test or Fisher's exact 
test to determine if there were statistically significant associations between
p16 immunoreactivity and patient age, gender, diagnosis, and ethnicity.
Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
RESULTS: We found an unexpectedly large prevalence of strong nuclear and
cytoplasmic p16 immunoreactivity in our cases. Almost all of the ocular surface
squamous lesions were diffusely positive for p16 expression (12/13). All of the
periorbital lesions showed diffuse p16 immunoreactivity (16/16). Altogether,
28/29 lesions tested showed strong and diffuse p16 expression. We found no
statistically significant correlation between p16 expression and patient age,
gender, ethnicity, or diagnosis. In 6 of the peri-orbital biopsies, we had
sufficient tissue to assess high-risk HPV expression by in situ hybridization.
Interestingly, all of these cases were negative for HPV, despite strong p16
expression.
CONCLUSION: Strong p16 expression was observed in virtually all of the ocular
surface and peri-orbital squamous neoplasms in our study. The relationship
between p16 expression and HPV infection in ocular surface and peri-orbital sites
requires further investigation.
