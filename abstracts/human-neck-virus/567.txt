G-rich region of HPV16 is shown to preferentially form hairpin structures, while regions of HPV18, HPV52 and HPV58 fold into four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms found in G-rich sequences have been found to promote formation of hairpin structures of HPV16 and have affected number of species formed in G-rich region of HPV52, whereas they have exhibited minimal effect on the formation of HPV18 and HPV58 G-quadruplex structures. These structural changes were reflected in differences in apparent thermal stabilities.
