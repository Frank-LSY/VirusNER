This study aimed to investigate the association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism
and the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) by conducting meta-analysis. The PubMed database was searched
for relevant studies until May 30, 2013. Relevant studies were selected and data 
were extracted by two independent authors. Overall, subgroup, and sensitivity
analyses were then conducted using the Comprehensive Meta- Analysis v2.2
software. Wild-genotype ArgArg was considered as reference [odds ratio (OR) =
1.00]. Nine studies involving 1071 HNSCC cases were obtained. Meta-analysis
results indicated no association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk
of HPV-related HNSCC: for Pro/Pro vs. Arg/Arg, OR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0.70-1.98; for Arg/Pro vs. Arg/ Arg, OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.97-1.72; and
for (Pro/Pro + Arg/Pro) vs. Arg/Arg, OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.95-1.70. These
meta-analysis results were supported by subgroup and sensitivity analysis
results. In conclusions, p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism is a potential marker of HP
infection-related HNSCC rather than a susceptibility gene polymorphism.
