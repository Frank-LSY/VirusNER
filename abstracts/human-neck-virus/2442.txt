PURPOSE: To explore the activity of a potent Chk1 inhibitor (SAR-020106) in
combination with radiation.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Colony and mechanistic in vitro assays and a xenograft
in vivo model.
RESULTS: SAR-020106 suppressed-radiation-induced G2/M arrest and reduced
clonogenic survival only in p53-deficient tumor cells. SAR-020106 promoted
mitotic entry following irradiation in all cell lines, but p53-deficient cells
were likely to undergo apoptosis or become aneuploid, while p53 wild-type cells
underwent a postmitotic G1 arrest followed by subsequent normal cell cycle
re-entry. Following combined treatment with SAR-020106 and radiation,
homologous-recombination-mediated DNA damage repair was inhibited in all cell
lines. A significant increase in the number of pan-γH2AX-staining apoptotic cells
was observed only in p53-deficient cell lines. Efficacy was confirmed in vivo in 
a clinically relevant human head-and-neck cell carcinoma xenograft model.
CONCLUSION: The Chk1 inhibitor SAR-020106 is a potent radiosensitizer in tumor
cell lines defective in p53 signaling.
