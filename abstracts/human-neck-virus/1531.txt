AIM: To evaluate if the lentiviral accessory protein Nef can down-regulate the
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in tumor cells and affect tumor cell
proliferation, migration and angiogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa-(ACC) cells, which according to genotype analysis are
virtually identical to the cervical cancer-derived HeLa cell line, were
transfected with Nef from SIV(mac239) and expression levels of cell surface CXCR4
were monitored by flow cytometry. Real-time proliferation and migration of cells 
was measured with the xCELLigence system or with the in vitro scratch assay. In
vitro tube formation was deployed to assess the effect of Nef on angiogenesis.
RESULTS: Cell surface down-regulation of CXCR4 was observed in HeLa-(ACC) cells
after Nef transfection, as well as in the monkey kidney-derived COS-7 cell line
after co-transfection of CXCR4 and Nef. Proliferation, as well as migration, of
Nef-transfected HeLa-(ACC) cells appeared to be significantly reduced. In vitro
tube formation was markedly lowered after Nef transfection, and CXCR4 knockdown
with siRNA.
CONCLUSION: SIV-Nef could serve as an interesting tool to study the biological
behavior of CXCR4-expressing tumor cells and could be helpful in the discovery of
new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CXCR4-positive tumors.
