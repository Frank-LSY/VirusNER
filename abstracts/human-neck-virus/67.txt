BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present the clinicopathological
features of a series of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head 
and neck second primary tumors.
METHODS: Patients with HPV-associated head and neck second primary tumors from 3 
centers were identified. HPV infection was evaluated using p16 by
immunohistochemistry (IHC), high-risk HPV DNA by in situ hybridization (ISH), and
HPV genotyping by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified: 5 with synchronous and 6 with
metachronous HPV-positive second primary tumors, the latter demonstrating a mean 
time interval of 5 years. There were 13 second primary tumors: 11 oropharyngeal, 
1 nasopharyngeal, and 1 floor of the mouth. Nine of 10 genotyped patients
harbored HPV-16, and 1 patient had HPV-33 in 3 synchronous tumors.
CONCLUSION: HPV-associated second primary tumors may present as synchronous
and/or metachronous lesions and can arise outside the oropharynx after prolonged 
intervals. Further work is necessary to identify patients at risk and to
elucidate the mechanisms of HPV-associated head and neck second primary tumors.
