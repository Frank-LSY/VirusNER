Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with a variety of head and neck
neoplasms, including squamous cell carcinomas and Schneiderian papillomas.
Ameloblastomas can arise from either the gnathic bones or peripheral soft
tissues. Peripheral sinonasal ameloblastomas share clinical features with
Schneiderian papillomas. A small number of reports have described detection of
HPV DNA within ameloblastomas. However, Most of these cases was reported in the
1990s, used the polymerase chain reaction technique, and only examined gnathic
tumors. The current study was designed to determine whether low- or high-risk HPV
DNA could be detected in gnathic or peripheral ameloblastomas using in situ
hybridization. Twenty-nine examples of gnathic osseous and peripheral head and
neck ameloblastomas were obtained from the authors' archives (University of
Virginia and the Johns Hopkins Hospital). High-risk HPV DNA was not detected in
any of the 29 tumors analyzed. Low-risk HPV DNA was identified in only 1 tumor,
which was peripheral in origin, and from an immunocompromised patient. We believe
that the HPV in this case represents a background "passenger" infection. This
study demonstrates that HPV of either high- or low-risk subtypes is unlikely to
play a role in the pathogenesis of sinonasal ameloblastomas.
