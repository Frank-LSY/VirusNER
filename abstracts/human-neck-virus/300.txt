HPV was identified in 7 (6.3%) tumours, while 22 (19.6%) had positive p16 immunohistochemical staining. There was concordance between the results obtained using the three PCR assays. There was substantial agreement between the results of molecular tests and p16 immunohistochemistry for hypopharyngeal carcinomas, but only fair agreement for laryngeal and oropharyngeal carcinomas.
