The recent emergence of a clinically distinct subset of head and neck cancers
(HNC) caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) necessitates
critical reevaluation of the existing counseling paradigm for patients with newly
diagnosed HNC. Herein we propose a structural framework for patient counseling in
which HPV testing is incorporated and the impact of HPV-status is discussed in
the context of multiple medical and psychosocial domains. We strive to maintain a
balance between making recommendations based on the best available scientific
evidence and acknowledgment of uncertainty for both patients and providers. We
anticipate that both the standard-of-care diagnostic workup and treatment, and
counseling guidelines for these patients will change rapidly in the years ahead, 
as data from ongoing and planned prospective clinical trials become available.
