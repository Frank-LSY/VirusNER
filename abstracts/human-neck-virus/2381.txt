OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
expression level on the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR.
METHODS: In four human head and neck carcinoma cell lines, epidermal growth
factor expression was knocked down by lentiviral RNA interference. Next, the
efficacies of cetuximab and panitumumab at concentrations of 4, 40, and 400 μg/ml
were measured by real time cell analysis for a 48-h duration. Finally, the
different response rates to the drugs were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: The lentiviral EGFR knockdown efficiency ranged from 18 to 54 % across
all of the cell lines. All original cell lines exhibited rather poor or inverse
responses with regard to EGFR-AB treatment. In contrast, inhibiting EGFR
expression in the same cell lines yielded statistically significant better
responses to cetuximab or panitumumab treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The cell lines used in this study responded poorly to cetuximab and 
panitumumab. Better anti-EGFR treatment efficacy was related to lower EGFR
expression in head and neck cancer cell lines. These findings might influence the
selection of patients to receive cetuximab and panitumumab treatment for head and
neck cancer.
