PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the factors contributing to the clinical
presentation of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in the era of risk 
stratification using human papilloma virus (HPV) and smoking status.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients with OPSCC presenting to our institutional
multidisciplinary clinic from January 2009 to June 2015 were reviewed from a
prospective database. The patients were grouped as being at low risk,
intermediate risk, and high risk in the manner described by Ang et al. Variance
in clinical presentation was examined using χ(2), Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney,
and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The rates of HPV/p16 positivity (P<.001), never-smoking (P=.016), and
cervical lymph node metastases (P=.023) were significantly higher for patients
with OPSCC of the tonsil, base of tongue (BOT), or vallecula subsites when
compared with pharyngeal wall or palate subsites. Low-risk patients with tonsil, 
base of tongue, or vallecula primary tumors presented with nodal stage N2a at a
much higher than expected frequency (P=.007), and high-risk patients presented
with tumor stage T4 at a much higher than expected frequency (P=.003). Patients
with BOT primary tumors who were never-smokers were less likely to have
clinically involved ipsilateral neck disease than were former smokers (odds ratio
1.8; P=.038). The distribution of cervical lymph node metastases was not
associated with HPV/p16 positivity, risk group, or subsite. When these data were 
compared with those in historical series, no significant differences were seen in
the patterns of cervical lymph node metastases for patients with OPSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with OPSCC differences in HPV status, smoking history
and anatomic subsite were associated with differences in clinical presentation
but not with distribution of cervical lymph node metastases. Historical series
describing the patterns of cervical lymph node metastases in patients with OPSCC 
remain clinically relevant.
