BACKGROUND: The purpose of this work was to investigate the prognostic
significance of E-cadherin and β-catenin expression in surgically treated human
papillomavirus (HPV)-negative patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC).
METHODS: Consecutive patients with oropharyngeal SCC who underwent surgical
treatment between 1990 and 2009 were retrospectively collected.
Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin and β-catenin expression was performed
on tissue microarrays.
RESULTS: E-cadherin and β-catenin expression was evaluable in 232 cases. Low
membranous E-cadherin, low membranous β-catenin expression, and nuclear β-catenin
expression were associated with a poorer disease-specific and overall survival,
although the differences were only significant for β-catenin membranous
expression (P = .024 and P = .016, respectively). In multivariate analysis, nodal
metastasis and low membranous β-catenin expression were significant independent
predictors of reduced disease-specific and overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Low membranous β-catenin expression is a significant independent
predictor of both reduced disease-specific and overall survival in patients with 
HPV-negative oropharyngeal SCC.
