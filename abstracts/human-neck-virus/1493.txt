Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are one of the leading causes of
cancer deaths world wide. Up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins in these cancers is linked to
aggressive tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. Infection of two HNSCC
cell lines, SCC25 and CAL27 by an Ad5 mutant (lp11w) defective in coding for the 
viral anti-apoptosis protein, E1B-19K efficiently induced apoptotic cell death.
In cells infected with lp11w there was a dramatic down-regulation of EGFR by
apoptosis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The levels of the anti-apoptotic
proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL and MCL-1 were also down-regulated in lp11w-infected cells
compared to uninfected or Ad5-RM infected cells. Infection with lp11w also
enhanced sensitivity of the HNSCC cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin.
Our results suggest that adenoviral vectors defective in E1B-19K would be
valuable for efficient down-regulation of cell survival proteins and EGFR in
epithelial cancers and could be exploited as oncolytic agents to treat HNSCCs.
