Many cancer types, including head and neck cancers (HNC), express programmed
death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor, programmed
death 1 (PD-1), inhibits the function of activated T cells and results in an
immunosuppressive microenvironment, but the stimuli that induce PD-L1 expression 
are not well characterized. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) and the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) utilize Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) as a common signaling node
to transmit tumor cell-mediated extrinsic or intrinsic signals, respectively. In 
this study, we investigated the mechanism by which these factors upregulate PD-L1
expression in HNC cells in the context of JAK/STAT pathway activation, Th1
inflammation, and HPV status. We found that wild-type, overexpressed EGFR
significantly correlated with JAK2 and PD-L1 expression in a large cohort of HNC 
specimens. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was induced in an EGFR- and
JAK2/STAT1-dependent manner, and specific JAK2 inhibition prevented PD-L1
upregulation in tumor cells and enhanced their immunogenicity. Collectively, our 
findings suggest a novel role for JAK2/STAT1 in EGFR-mediated immune evasion, and
therapies targeting this signaling axis may be beneficial to block PD-L1
upregulation found in a large subset of HNC tumors.
