PURPOSE: Despite the comparably high cure rates observed for HPV-positive HNSCC, 
there is still a great need for specific tumor radiosensitization due to the
often severe side effects resulting from intense radiochemotherapy. We recently
demonstrated that HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines are characterized by a defect in 
DNA double-strand break repair associated with a pronounced G2-arrest. Here we
tested whether abrogation of this radiation-induced G2-arrest by the inhibition
of Chk1 results in specific radiosensitization of HPV-positive HNSCC cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed with five HPV and p16-positive 
(93-VU-147T, UM-SCC-47, UT-SCC-45, UD-SCC-2, UPCI-SCC-154) and two HPV and
p16-negative HNSCC cell lines, as well as two normal human fibroblast strains.
Chk1 was inhibited by the selective inhibitor PF-00477736. Cell cycle
distribution was determined by flow cytometry, Chk1-activity via Western blot and
cell survival by colony formation assay.
RESULTS: With the exception of UPCI-SCC-154, the inhibition of Chk1 was found to 
abolish the pronounced radiation-induced G2-arrest in all HPV-positive cells
utilized. All tumor cell lines that demonstrated the abrogation of G2-arrest also
demonstrated radiosensitization. Notably, in G1-arrest-proficient normal human
fibroblasts no radiosensitization was induced.
CONCLUSION: Abrogation of the G2 checkpoint through the inhibition of Chk1 may be
used to selectively increase the cellular radiosensitivity of HPV-positive HNSCC 
without affecting the surrounding normal tissue.
