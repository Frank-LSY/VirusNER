Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) of the
elderly is a newly described lymphoproliferative disorder that arises in elderly 
patients without a predisposing immunodeficiency. Clinical features at
presentation may include lymphadenopathy, B-symptoms and extranodal involvement. 
The main sites of extranodal involvement are the skin, lung, tonsil and stomach. 
Histopathological findings include atypical large lymphoid cells with variable
amounts of reactive cells, such as small lymphocytes, plasma cells and
histiocytes. The neoplastic cells are positive for CD20, and in situ
hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA is positive in the majority of neoplastic
cells. We present a new case of EBV-positive DLBCL in an 85-year-old man, who
presented to our clinic with a 2-month history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions 
involving his face and scalp.
