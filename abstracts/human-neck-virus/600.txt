Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous group of malignancies accounting for
approximately 600,000 new cases every year worldwide. Human papillomavirus
(HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancers represent a new nosological entity for
pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, prognostic trend and therapeutic response.
Several clinical trials have shown that HPV-positive/p16-positive cancer patients
have a favorable prognosis demanding for de-escalation of current therapies.
Comprehensive genomic analyses allowed to identify specific genetic alterations
in targetable genes envisaging novel approaches to treat different subset of
HPV-related and HPV-unrelated oropharyngeal cancers. Furthermore virus associated
head and neck cancers may benefit from new developed immunotherapies targeting
HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. We reviewed recent studies on the role of HPV
infection in these cancers and present our current understanding of carcinogenic 
mechanisms providing possible novel approaches to cancer treatment.
