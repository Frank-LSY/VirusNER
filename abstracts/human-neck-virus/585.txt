BACKGROUND: Limited information is available about the involvement of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) in
Romanian patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the HPV-attributable fraction in HNSCCs collected in
Northeastern Romania.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 189 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
samples (99 oral cavity tumors, 28 oropharynx, 48 pharynx, and 14
larynx/hypopharynx) were analyzed for HPV DNA and RNA using Luminex-based assays,
and for overexpression of p16INK4a (p16) by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Of the 189 cases, 23 (12.2%) were HPV DNA-positive, comprising half of
the oropharyngeal cases (14/28, 50.0%) and 9/161 (5.6%) of the non-oropharyngeal 
cases. HPV16 was the most prevalent HPV type (20/23, 86.9%), followed by HPV18
(5/23, 21.7%) and HPV39 (1/23, 4.3%). Only two (2/189, 1.1%) HNSCC cases were
HPV-driven, i.e. positive for both HPV DNA and RNA.
CONCLUSION: A very small subset of HNSCC cases within this cohort from
Northeastern Romania appeared to be HPV-driven.
