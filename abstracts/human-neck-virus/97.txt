OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Delineate factors impacting the creation and use of
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of human papilloma virus-related (HPV+) head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs).
STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory-based translational study.
METHODS: Fifty-one surgically resected HNSCCs, including 31 HPV + cancers, were
implanted into NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice using standardized methodology.
Clinical and pathologic factors were tested for association with engraftment. The
gross, histologic, and molecular features of established HPV + PDXs were analyzed
in comparison to their tumors of origin.
RESULTS: Negative HPV status and perineural invasion (PNI) were independent,
additive factors associated with increased PDX formation. Epstein-Barr
virus-positive (EBV+) human large B-cell lymphomas grew from 32% of HPV + HNSCC
cases that failed to engraft. Successfully established HPV + PDXs retained
basaloid histology and often developed cystic growth patterns typical of
HPV + nodal metastases. They also maintained elevated p16INK4A levels and
expression of E6/E7 viral oncogene transcripts.
CONCLUSION: Reduced engraftment by HPV + tumors lacking PNI likely results in
selection biases in HNSCC PDX models. Formation of EBV + lymphomas in NSG mice
further reduces the generation of HPV + models and must be ruled out before
long-term use of PDXs. Nevertheless, the retention of distinctive pathologic
traits and viral oncogene expression by HPV + PDXs provides a viable in vivo
platform for basic and translational studies as well as a resource for generating
advanced in vitro models.
