Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are prevalent pathogens of mucosal and cutaneous
epithelia. Productive infections of squamous epithelia lead to benign
hyperproliferative warts, condylomata, or papillomas. Persistent infections of
the anogenital mucosa by high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 and closely related
types can infrequently progress to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias,
carcinomas-in-situ, and invasive cancers in women and men. HPV-16 is also
associated with a fraction of head and neck cancers. We discuss the interactions 
of the mucosotropic HPVs with the host regulatory proteins and pathways that lead
to benign coexistence and enable HPV DNA amplification or, alternatively, to
cancers that no longer support viral production.
