The updated eighth edition of the Cancer Staging Manual of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer will be implemented in January 2018. There are multiple
changes to the head and neck section of the manual, which will be relevant to
radiologists participating in multidisciplinary head and neck tumor boards and
reading pretreatment head and neck cancer scans. Human
papillomavirus-related/p16(+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma will now be
staged separately; this change reflects the markedly better prognosis of these
tumors compared with non-human papillomavirus/p16(-) oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma. Nodal staging has dramatically changed so that there are different
tables for human papillomavirus/p16(+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma,
Epstein-Barr virus-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and all other head and neck 
squamous cell carcinomas. Extranodal extension of tumor is a new clinical feature
for this third staging group. In the oral cavity, the pathologically determined
depth of tumor invasion is a new staging criterion, while extrinsic tongue muscle
invasion is no longer part of staging. This review serves to educate radiologists
on the eighth edition changes and their rationale.
