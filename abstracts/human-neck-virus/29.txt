Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major causative agent of cervical cancers. Over
the past several decades, increasing number of studies established strong
association of HPV with a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs). In the present study, we reviewed evidence, including epidemiology,
carcinogens, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, showing that HPV-positive
HNSCCs exhibit a variety of distinct characteristics for understanding tumor
biology and improving cancer treatment.
