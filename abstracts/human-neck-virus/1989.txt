OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical factors that can explain the differences in
treatment outcome, and examine the value of human papillomavirus infection as a
prognostic biomarker in stage IVa tonsillar carcinomas.
METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with tonsillar carcinoma classified as stage IVa
were retrospectively analysed for survival outcomes according to various clinical
factors. Human papillomavirus infection was evaluated using a human
papillomavirus DNA chip test and immunohistochemical staining for p16 and p53.
RESULTS: Lower disease-free survival rates were associated with increasing local 
invasiveness and nodal status. Although human papillomavirus positivity and p16
expression was more common in locally advanced tonsillar carcinomas with advanced
nodal status, the overall survival rate was better for patients with human
papillomavirus positive, p16-positive tumours.
CONCLUSION: The disease-free survival rate may differ according to local tumour
invasiveness and nodal status, even for stage IVa tonsillar cancers. Human
papillomavirus infection may be a useful biomarker for predicting treatment
outcomes for stage VIa tumours.
