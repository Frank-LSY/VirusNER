BACKGROUND: The recurrence rate of sinonasal inverted papillomas (SNIP) is
15-20%. However, few studies have investigated patient-dependent factors related 
to recurrence of SNIPs.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors, including human papilloma virus (HPV)
infection and smoking, as well as other factors, for recurrence of SNIPs.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients who were diagnosed with SNIP and underwent surgery
were enrolled: 39 men and 15 women, with the mean age of 54.0 years. Their mean
follow-up was 40.6 months. Demographics and information about the history of
smoking, previous surgery, tumor extent, follow-up, and recurrence were reviewed 
retrospectively. Those patients whose tumors were associated with malignant
transformation were excluded in this study. HPV detection and genotyping in the
tumor specimens were performed with the HPV DNA chip, a polymerase chain
reaction-based DNA microarray system.
RESULTS: Seven patients (13.0%) had recurrence, with a mean time to recurrence of
39.8 months. Recurrence rates in T1, T2, T3, and T4 of the Krouse staging system 
were 0% (0/4), 8.3% (2/24), 17.4% (4/23), and 33.3% (1/3), respectively (p >
0.5). Eight patients (14.8%) were positive for HPV DNA. All of these patients
belonged to the group without recurrence (p > 0.5). However, recurrence rates
according to HPV DNA positivity were not statistically different (0% versus
15.2%). Three (42.9%) in the group with recurrence and four (8.5%) in the group
without recurrence were smokers (p < 0.5).
CONCLUSION: Smoking was associated with recurrence of SNIP. However, HPV
infection is not a recurrence of SNIP risk factor.
