Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a primary oncogene encoded by the
Epstein-Barr virus, and various portions of LMP1 are detected in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) tumor cells. LMP1 has been extensively studied since the
discovery of its transforming property in 1985. LMP1 promotes cancer cell growth 
during NPC development and facilitates the interaction of cancer cells with
surrounding stromal cells for invasion, angiogenesis, and immune modulation. LMP1
is detected in 100% of pre-invasive NPC tumors and in approximately 50% of
advanced NPC tumors. Moreover, a small population of LMP1-expressing cells in
advanced NPC tumor tissue is proposed to orchestrate NPC tumor tissue maintenance
and development through cancer stem cells and progenitor cells. Recent studies
suggest that LMP1 activity shifts according to tumor development stage, but it
still has a pivotal role during all stages of NPC development.
