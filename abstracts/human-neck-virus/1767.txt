Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive primary cutaneous carcinoma with
high mortality and rising incidence. The exact etiology of MCC remains unclear,
but it is likely multifactorial with many factors playing a role, among these,
ultraviolet radiation, immunosuppression, and recently, Merkel cell polyomavirus.
Clinically MCC appears as an asymptomatic, firm, skin colored, sometimes
reddish-blue, dome-shaped papule or plaque or subcutaneous nodule typically
localized on the head and neck region that has grown rapidly. As its clinical
presentation is generally non specific, the diagnosis relies on histological and 
immunohistochemical findings. Once diagnosis is established, adequate staging
requires evaluation of regional and distant metastases. Treatment is based on
multidisciplinary management although optimal therapy is controversial, at least 
in part due to a lack of quality data. Aggressive surgery frequently associated
with adjuvant radiotherapy is used to improve the rates of locoregional
recurrence and overall survival as well. Future targeted therapies may open new
perspectives for the treatment of patients although high-quality, multicentre and
randomized studies are needed. In this article, the current knowledge about MCC
is reviewed and discussed.
