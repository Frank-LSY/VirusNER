Epidemiological studies show an increasing incidence of human papilloma
virus-associated oropharyngeal cancer. HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) is recognized as a special subgroup of HNSCC. Because
HPV-positive patients are often younger and have an outstanding prognosis,
long-term toxicities of therapy have become an important issue. Current clinical 
trials focus on a reduction of treatment-related toxicity and the development of 
HPV-specific therapies. New treatment strategies include a dose reduction of
radiotherapy, the use of cetuximab instead of cisplatin for chemoradiation and
transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Increasing comprehension of the molecular
background of HPV-associated HNSCC has also lead to more specific treatment
attempts including immunotherapeutic strategies. Whereas recently published data 
shed light on immune mechanisms resulting in a tolerogenic niche for HPV and
HPV-associated HNSCC, other studies focus on specific vaccination of HPV-positive
HNSCC. This study will summarize current therapy approaches and illustrate
ongoing clinical trials in the field of HPV-positive HNSCC.
