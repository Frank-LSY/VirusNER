OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine predictors of high-risk and low-risk oral HPV
infection in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analyses of National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey cross-sectional data of U.S. population from 2009 to 2012.
METHODS: Database queried for subjects aged 18 to 69 with oral rinse human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA data. Logistic regression identified factors associated 
with high-risk and low-risk infection. Covariates included age, gender,
ethnicity, income-to-poverty (IP) ratio, sexual orientation, human
immunodeficiency virus infection, other sexually transmitted infections, lifetime
sexual partners, and lifetime oral sex partners.
RESULTS: In total, 9,256 subjects were identified with mean age of 42.1 years.
Oral HPV infection was present in 8.1% (N = 747); 55.7% were high-risk and 55.3% 
were low-risk types, including 11% with both. Oral infection had a negative
association with female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.3, P < 0.001), IP ratio ≥ 3 (OR
0.7, P = 0.02), and one lifetime oral sex partner (OR 0.7, P = 0.03). Increasing 
oral sex behavior (6-21+ lifetime partners) was positively associated with oral
HPV (OR 1.4-3.0, P = 0.03). Low-risk infection had negative associations with
female gender (OR 0.4, P < 0.001) and non-Hispanic white ethnicity (OR 0.6, P =
0.02), IP ratio ≥ 3 (OR 0.6, P = 0.01), and positive association with > 20 sexual
partners (all sex OR 1.7, P = 0.04; oral sex OR 1.9, P = 0.02). Predictors of
high-risk HPV infection included male gender and increasing oral sex partners.
CONCLUSION: Increasing oral sex partners is positively associated with oral HPV
infection; female sex and higher socioeconomic class are negatively associated.
The risk-factor profiles for high-risk and low-risk HPV types are distinct, with 
similar trends related to sexual behaviors.
