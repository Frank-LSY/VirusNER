During cell entry of an enveloped virus, the viral membrane must be fused with
the cellular membrane. The virus envelope has a unique structure consisting of
viral proteins and a virus-specific lipid composition, whereas the host membrane 
has its own structure with host membrane proteins. Compound 136 was previously
found to bind in close proximity to the viral envelope and inhibit influenza
virus entry. We showed here that the 136-treated influenza virus still caused
hemolysis. When liposomes were used as the target membrane for 136-treated
viruses, aberrant fusion occurred; few liposomes fused per virion, and
glycoproteins were not distributed evenly across fusion complexes. Additionally, 
large fusion aggregates did not form, and in some instances, neck-like structures
were found. Based on previous results and hemolysis, fusion inhibition by 136
occurs post-scission but prior to lipid mixing.
