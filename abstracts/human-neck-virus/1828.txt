AIM: To combine clinical and molecular markers into an algorithm for predicting
outcome for individual patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA/p16(INK4a)
positive tonsillar and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC and BOTSCC).
BACKGROUND: Head-neck cancer treatment has become more intensified, comprising
not only surgery and radiotherapy, but also induction/concomitant chemotherapy
and targeted therapy. With less treatment, 3-year disease free survival (DFS) is 
80% for HPV-positive TSCC and BOTSCC. An 85-100% 3-year DFS is observed for
HPV(+) TSCC and BOTSCC with absence of HLA class I, or CD44 expression, or high
CD8(+) tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts suggesting that therapy could 
be tapered for many if patients could be identified individually.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated curatively, with HPV DNA/p16(INK4a)
positive tumours examined for HLA class I and II, CD44 and CD8(+)TILs, were
included. An L1-regularised logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect
of the biomarker data, age, stage, diagnosis, smoking and treatment on 3-year
risk of death or relapse on a training cohort of 197 patients diagnosed 2000-2007
and validated on a cohort of 118 patients diagnosed 2008-2011.
RESULTS: The variables finally included in the model were HLA class I, CD8(+)
TILs, age, stage and diagnosis (TSCC or BOTSCC). The model showed acceptable
discrimination and calibration. The discriminative ability of the model did not
diminish after validation (AUC=0.77).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first model to utilise information from
several markers to predict an individual probability of clinical outcome for
patients with HPV DNA/p16(INK4a) positive tumours.
