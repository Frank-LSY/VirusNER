OBJECTIVES:: Worldwide studies have shown an increasing trend of oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) but a decreasing trend of oral cavity cancers
over the past 2 decades, particularly in developed countries with successful
tobacco control. This trend has been attributed to the increase in the incidence 
of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated OPSCC. The aim of this study was to
examine sex differences in incidence trends of oropharyngeal and oral cavity
cancers in Hong Kong from 1983 to 2014.
METHODS:: Using data from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry from 1983 to 2014,
age-standardized incidence rates for potentially HPV-associated sites
(oropharyngeal) and non-HPV-associated sites (oral cavity) were calculated,
stratified by sex and age groups. Joinpoint regression and an age-period-cohort
model were used to assess incidence trends.
RESULTS:: A total of 1,972 cases of oropharyngeal cancer and 7,389 cases of oral 
cavity cancer were diagnosed from 1983 to 2014. The male/female ratios were
4.16:1 for oropharyngeal cancers and 1.63:1 for oral cavity cancers. A
significant increasing trend was observed in oropharyngeal cancers from 1994 to
2014 (average annual percentage change = 2.66, P < .05). In contrast, a
significant decreasing trend was observed in oral cavity cancers from 1983 to
1994 (average annual percentage change = -5.36, P < .05). The trends were more
significant in men and in patients aged 45 to 69 years. A positive birth cohort
effect was observed for oropharyngeal cancer in men.
CONCLUSIONS:: The rising trend of oropharyngeal cancer and decreasing trend of
oral cavity cancer in Hong Kong from 1983 to 2014 are consistent with worldwide
trends. Increase in high-risk sexual behaviors and oral HPV infection may
influence the difference in trends.
