HPV status in 82 evaluable head and neck squamous cell carcinomas patients was determined by pyrosequencing and related to p16(INK4a) staining and treatment outcomes. It was correlated with tumor hypoxia (tumor pO(2) and carbonic anhydrase [CAIX] staining), EGFR status, and intratumoral lymphocyte expression (CD3 staining).
