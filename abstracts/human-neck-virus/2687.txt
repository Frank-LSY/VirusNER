Superantigens (SAgs) are derived from diverse sources, including bacteria,
viruses, and human hepatic tissue. SAgs initially cause lymphocyte activation but
then result in clonal deletion and anergy, leading to immune tolerance. They can 
also act as superallergens by stimulating a broad spectrum of mast cells and
basophils in patients with allergic conditions. The newly described
staphylococcal SAg-like proteins subvert innate immune function by several
mechanisms, which are distinct from SAgs' effects on lymphocytes and other
acquired immune processes. There is mounting evidence to suggest that SAgs play a
role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory airway disease. The pathophysiologic 
role of SAg-like proteins awaits clarification.
