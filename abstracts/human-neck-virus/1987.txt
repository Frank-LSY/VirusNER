PURPOSE: This study sought to define the recommended dose of
JS1/34.5-/47-/GM-CSF, an oncolytic herpes simplex type-1 virus (HSV-1) encoding
human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), for future
studies in combination with chemoradiotherapy in patients with squamous cell
cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with stage III/IVA/IVB SCCHN received
chemoradiotherapy (70 Gy/35 fractions with concomitant cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) on
days 1, 22, and 43) and dose-escalating (10(6), 10(6), 10(6), 10(6) pfu/mL for
cohort 1; 10(6), 10(7), 10(7), 10(7) for cohort 2; 10(6), 10(8), 10(8), 10(8) for
cohort 3) JS1/34.5-/47-/GM-CSF by intratumoral injection on days 1, 22, 43, and
64. Patients underwent neck dissection 6 to 10 weeks later. Primary end points
were safety and recommended dose/schedule for future study. Secondary end points 
included antitumor activity (radiologic, pathologic). Relapse rates and survival 
were also monitored.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients were treated without delays to chemoradiotherapy or
dose-limiting toxicity. Fourteen patients (82.3%) showed tumor response by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and pathologic complete remission
was confirmed in 93% of patients at neck dissection. HSV was detected in injected
and adjacent uninjected tumors at levels higher than the input dose, indicating
viral replication. All patients were seropositive at the end of treatment. No
patient developed locoregional recurrence, and disease-specific survival was
82.4% at a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 19-40 months).
CONCLUSIONS: JS1/34.5-/47-/GM-CSF combined with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy
is well tolerated in patients with SCCHN. The recommended phase II dose is 10(6),
10(8), 10(8), 10(8). Locoregional control was achieved in all patients, with a
76.5% relapse-free rate so far. Further study of this approach is warranted in
locally advanced SCCHN.
