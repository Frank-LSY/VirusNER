The publication of the new WHO classification of head and neck tumours in
2017 brought major modifications. Especially, a new chapter is dedicated to the
oropharynx, focusing on the description of squamous cell carcinoma induced by the
virus Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), and new entities of tumors are described in
nasal cavities and sinuses. In this article are presented the novelties and main 
changes of this new classification, as well as the updates of the diagnostic
methods (immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics or molecular biology).
