BACKGROUND: In cancer, tumor escape from the host immune system includes
apoptosis of circulating CD3(+)CD8(+) effector T lymphocytes. Here, we compare
sensitivity to apoptosis of virus- with tumor-specific circulating CD8(+) T cells
in patients with head and neck cancer.
METHODS: Wild-type p53 peptide-specific (p53(264-272) and p53(149-157)) and viral
peptide-specific (EBV BMLF(259-267) and CMVpp65(495-503)) tetramers were used to 
measure the frequency of reactive T cells by flow cytometry. Annexin V (ANX)
binding to circulating 7-amino-actinomycin D-negative but tetramer(+)CD8(+) T
cells in PBMC obtained from 21 patients with head and neck cancer and 11 normal
controls (NC) was evaluated.
RESULTS: In patients with head and neck cancer, a higher percentage of
tetramer(+)CD8(+) than tetramer(-)CD8(+) T cells bound ANX (p < .023-.005).
Although most tumor-epitope(+)CD8(+) T cells bound ANX, lower percentages of
virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were ANX(+) in the same patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Preferential demise of circulating tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells and
their paucity in head and neck cancer contribute to tumor escape.
