BACKGROUND: Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are known to be associated
with carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Furthermore, current studies have shown
that HPV-infection is also associated with a subtype of oropharyngeal cancers. In
general, a sexual transmission of the viruses has been shown by numerous studies 
in the genital lesions. However, there are unknown factors regarding the
prevalence and transmission of HPV in the oropharynx. The aim of this study was
to evaluate HPV prevalence in the oropharynx in female participants with and
without genital HPV infection. In addition, we analyzed risk factors for an
oropharyngeal colonization with HPV in their sexual partners, too.
METHODS: 129 Female participants were tested for presence of HPV-DNA by oral
lavage, brush cytology of the tonsils and of the cervix. In addition, 15 male
partners of these patients were included in the study. HPV-DNA was detected by
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification. For HPV-genotyping, PCR products
were hybridized with type-specific digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes and
discriminated into 14 high risk (HR) and 6 low risk (LR)-HPV types. The 129
female and 15 male participants were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire 
for socioeconomic details, drinking, smoking and sexual behaviours.
RESULTS: 59 (45.7%) Female participants were negative for a genital
HPV-infection. Of these women, 3 (5.1%) showed a positive HPV-PCR result (HR and 
LR) in the oropharynx. 70 (54.3%) Female participants were positive for a genital
HPV infection. In this group, 4 (5.7%) had a positive HPV-detection (HR and LR)
in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Female participants with cervical
HPV-infection had no higher risk for HPV-detection in the oropharynx (not
significant). The analysis of sexual risk factors revealed no specific risk
factor for an oral HPV-infection.
CONCLUSION: A correlation between cervical and oral colonization by HPV could not
be demonstrated in our small cohort. Our limited data suggest that sexual
transmission of HPV from the cervix uteri to the oropharynx is a rare and
unlikely event.
