The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of HeLa cells to the
interaction with inactivated Staphylococcus aureus cells and live challenge with 
herpes simplex virus (HSV).The results of this study are indicating that the
interaction between the HeLa cells and S. aureus inactivated whole cells could
modulate the host cell apoptosis and cytokine production, and therefore,
influence the progression of HSV infection. The pre-treatment of HeLa cells with 
heat inactivated bacterial whole cells protects them from the occurrence of HSV
mediated cytopathic effect, while the post viral infection treatment with
bacterial cells prevents the high activation of bax/bcl-2 apoptotic pathway, a
process that could change the fate of the infectious process triggered by the
virus, and eventually reduce its multiplication rate. The pre-treatment of HeLa
monolayer with inactivated bacterial cells 24 hours before the viral infection is
increasing the expression level of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 pro-inflammatory
cytokines genes, also suggesting that bacterial antigens could contribute to the 
decrease of viral multiplication rate.
