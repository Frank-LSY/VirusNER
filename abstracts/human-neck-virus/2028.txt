OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential clinical application of the oncolytic
activity of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) promoter-based, conditional,
replication-selective adenovirus vector for hypopharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma.
DESIGN: In vivo study and retrospective study.
SETTING: Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.
SUBJECTS: Expression of COX-2 in hypopharyngeal cancers treated at Kobe
University Hospital was immunohistochemically investigated. In addition, nude
mice bearing human hypopharyngeal cancer cells (H891) were used to analyze
oncolytic activity of a conditional replication-selective adenovirus vector in
which the expression of E1a, required for viral replication, is controlled by the
COX-2 promoter Ad-COX2-E1a.
RESULTS: In vivo assays showed significant growth suppression in the murine
hypopharyngeal model. Cyclooxygenase 2 expression was observed in 75.3% of
hypopharyngeal cancers, especially in differentiated tumor cells (P = .001; r =
0.433).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated the potential of oncolytic therapy
using the COX-2-promoter based, conditional, replication-selective adenovirus for
COX-2-expressing hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.
