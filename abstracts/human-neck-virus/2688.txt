BACKGROUND: Biomarkers that facilitate the prediction of disease recurrence in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may enable physicians to
personalize treatment. In the current study, DNA promoter methylation of
programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, PD-1) was evaluated as a prognostic biomarker in 
HNSCC patients.
RESULTS: High PDCD1 methylation (mPDCD1) was associated with a significantly
shorter overall survival after surgical resection in both the discovery (HR =
2.24 [95%CI: 1.08-4.64], p = 0.029) and the validation cohort (HR = 1.54 [95%CI: 
1.08-2.21], p = 0.017). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, PDCD1 
methylation remained a significant prognostic factor for HNSCC (HR = 2.14 [95%CI:
1.19-3.84], p = 0.011). Further, mPDCD1 was strongly associated with the human
papilloma virus (HPV) status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: mPDCD1 was assessed retrospectively in a discovery cohort 
of 120 HNSCC patients treated at the University Hospital of Bonn and a validation
cohort of 527 HNSCC cases analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.
CONCLUSIONS: PDCD1 methylation might aid the identification of HNSCC patients
potentially benefitting from a radical or alternative treatment, particularly in 
the context of immunotherapies targeting PD-1/PD-L1.
