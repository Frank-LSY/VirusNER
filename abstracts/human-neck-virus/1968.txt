OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of posttreatment positron emission tomography 
and computed tomography (PET/CT) to predict ultimate disease status in patients
with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and known human papillomavirus (HPV)
status.
DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: Single tertiary academic referral center.
PATIENTS: Clinical and radiographic data, including HPV status, were available
for 62 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who underwent
treatment from 2005 to 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The first posttreatment PET/CT scan, performed between 4
and 16 weeks (median, 9 weeks) after treatment, was categorized as negative,
probably negative, or positive for residual disease. The PET/CT and clinical
follow-up results, including disease status, were obtained every 3 months
thereafter.
RESULTS: Among the 62 patients, 35 results (56%) were negative, 15 (24%) were
probably negative, and 12 (19%) were positive. Eight of the 27 HPV-negative
patients were PET/CT positive compared with 4 of the 35 HPV-positive patients
(Cochran-Armitage trend test, P = .11). The median follow-up for disease-free
patients was 21 months from the completion of the treatment. Disease-free
survival was associated with PET/CT outcome (log-rank P < .001) and HPV status
(log-rank P = .01). Using recurrence at 2 years as a reference standard, the
early PET/CT scans had a specificity of 69% (95% confidence interval [CI],
46%-91%) and a negative predictive value of 79% (95% CI, 57%-99%). All
PET/CT-negative HPV-positive patients (n = 6) were free of disease at 2 years,
although this proportion was not statistically different from the PET/CT-negative
HPV-positive patients in this small cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: A negative posttreatment PET/CT result may have the potential to
identify patients who are at very low risk of recurrence. The HPV status may
augment the predictive utility of an initial negative PET/CT result.
