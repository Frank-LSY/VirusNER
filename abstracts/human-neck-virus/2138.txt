BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
have been demonstrated and attributed to differences in human papillomavirus
(HPV) status. The purpose of this study was to examine racial disparities in
oropharyngeal SCC among veterans.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with oropharyngeal SCC at a
tertiary-care Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards
models were conducted to examine the effect of race on oropharyngeal SCC
outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 158 patients, 126 (79.7%) were white and 32 (20.3%) were African
American. No difference in p16 tumor expression was noted between the groups.
Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 42.6% and 55.1% for African Americans
and whites, respectively (p = .372). Five-year overall survival (OS) for African 
Americans and whites was 54.6% and 51.8%, respectively (p = .768). On
multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in risk of recurrence 
or death by race.
CONCLUSION: Racial disparities are largely ameliorated in patients with
oropharyngeal SCC treated within the VA, there were no racial differences in p16 
tumor expression, and outcomes remain poor.
