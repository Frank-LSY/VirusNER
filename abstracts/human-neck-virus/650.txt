Allergic airway diseases are typically characterized by a type 2-biased
inflammation. Multiple distinct viruses and bacteria have been detected in the
airways. Recently, it has been confirmed that the microbiome of allergic
individuals differs from that of healthy subjects, showing a close relationship
with the type 2 response in allergic airway disease. In this review, we summarize
the recent findings on the prevalence of viruses and bacteria in type 2-biased
airway diseases and on the mechanisms employed by viruses and bacteria in
propagating type 2 responses. The understanding of the microbial composition and 
postinfectious immune programming is critical for the reconstruction of the
normal microflora and immune status in allergic airway diseases.
