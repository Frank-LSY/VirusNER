Vector dissemination, transient gene expression, and rapid clearance are major
obstacles to successful human gene therapy. In this study, we investigated the
effect of silk-elastinlike protein polymer (SELP) hydrogels on biodistribution
and anticancer efficacy of adenoviral gene therapy in a head and neck cancer
model. Transcriptional activities of adenovirus carrying beta-galactosidase
(Ad-LacZ) and luciferase (Ad-Luc) reporter genes were evaluated in (nu/nu) mice
with head and neck cancer as a function of polymer concentration. Antitumor
efficacy of thymidine kinase encoding adenovirus (Ad-Tk) and ganciclovir (GSV)
combination was also evaluated. SELP (4 wt %) matrices localized viral release,
minimized dissemination to liver, and enhanced reporter gene expression levels by
4-8-fold compared to virus alone. SELP- Ad-Tk with GSV reduced tumor volume
significantly compared to the virus alone. SELPs provide a means for temporal and
spatial control of viral gene delivery to head and neck tumors.
