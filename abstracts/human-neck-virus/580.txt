The rate of HPV-DNA detection in both oral rinse and tonsillar swab was significantly higher in OPC compared with non-OPC upper respiratory tract cancer and non-cancer diseases. HPV-DNA was detected in oral rinse in nine out of 12 p16-positive OPC cases, while none of the p16-negative OPC cases demonstrated detectable HPV-DNA. All p16-positive cases were also positive for HPV-DNA in tumor tissue. Based on p16 immunostaining, the sensitivity and specificity of HPV-DNA detection in oral rinse were 75% and 100%, respectively. Among eight of nine evaluable OPC cases positive for HPV-DNA in oral rinse at diagnosis, HPV-DNA was undetectable in oral rinse in seven cases after treatment.
