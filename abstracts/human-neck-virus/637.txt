Although development of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) is
commonly linked to the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, a link between human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection and a subgroup of head and neck cancers has been
established. These HPV-positive tumors represent a distinct biological entity
with overexpression of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. It has been shown in several
clinical studies that HPV-positive HNSCCs have a more favorable outcome and
greater response to radiotherapy. The reason for improved prognosis of
HPV-related HNSCC remains speculative, but it could be owned to multiple factors.
One hypothesis is that HPV-positive cells are intrinsically more sensitive to
standard therapies and thus respond better to treatment. Another possibility is
that HPV-positive tumors uniquely express viral proteins that induce an immune
response during therapy that helps clear tumors and prevents recurrence. Here, we
will review current evidence for the biological basis of increased
radiosensitivity in HPV-positive HNSCC.
