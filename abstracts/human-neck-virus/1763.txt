Primary infection of the immunocompromised host with the oncovirus Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) that targets mainly B-cells is associated with an increased risk for 
EBV-associated tumors. The early events subsequent to primary infection with
potential for B-cell transformation are poorly studied. Here, we modeled in vitro
the primary infection by using B-cells isolated from tonsils, the portal of entry
of EBV, since species specificity of EBV hampers modeling in experimental
animals. Increasing evidence indicates that the host DNA damage response (DDR)
can influence and be influenced by EBV infection. Thus, we inoculated tonsillar
B-cells (TBCs) with EBV-B95.8 and investigated cell proliferation and the DDR
during the first 96 hours thereafter. We identified for the first time that EBV
infection of TBCs induces a period of hyperproliferation 48-96 hours post
infection characterized by the activation of ataxia telangiectasia and
Rad3-releated (ATR) and checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1). Whereas inhibition of Chk1
did not affect B-cell transformation, the specific inhibition of ATR robustly
decreased the transformation efficiency of EBV. Our results suggest that
activation of ATR is key for EBV-induced B-cell transformation. Thus, targeting
the interaction between ATR/Chk1 and EBV could offer new options for the
treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.
