Provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (Pim-1) has proved 
to be an oncogene and it is known that to depress Pim-1 activity may be a novel
oncological treatment strategy. SGI-1776, a small molecule, is the first
clinically tested inhibitor of the Pim kinase family. Here, we aimed to explore
the effect of SGI-1776 on salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Expression of
Pim-1 was confirmed in SACC and control tissues by qRT-PCR. After SGI-1776
treatment, the Pim-1 expressions and Pim-1 kinase activity in both SACC-83 and
SACC-LM cell lines were measured. Cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell cycle, 
apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed. Also, the
expression of FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a, RUNX3, Bcl-2, BAD, p-BAD, Bim and p-Bim were
detected by Western blot. The results showed that Pim-1 was significantly
overexpressed in SACC tissues. SGI-1776 down-regulated the Pim-1 expression,
inhibited Pim-1 kinase activity, reduced cell proliferation, decreased invasive
ability, increased caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest
and mitochondrial depolarization. Reduced expression was also seen in p-FOXO3a,
RUNX3, Bcl-2, p-BAD and p-Bim, whereas no significant changes were observed from 
FOXO3a, BAD and Bim. These results confirm the pivotal role of Pim-1 in SACC and 
suggest that targeting Pim-1 kinase signal pathway by SGI-1776 might be a
promising therapeutic modality for SACC.
