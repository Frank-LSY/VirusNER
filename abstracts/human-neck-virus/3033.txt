A very rare case of necrotizing sialometaplasia of the parotid gland associated
with angiocentric T-cell lymphoma was described. A 66-year-old male had left neck
and pharyngeal masses and biopsy specimen showed a monotonous proliferation of
atypical lymphoid cells with massive necrosis in the parotid gland. Angiocentric 
pattern or vascular invasion by the lymphoid cells was observed and the involved 
parotid gland exhibited squamous metaplasia of the ducts and acini; necrotizing
sialometaplasia. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a cytotoxic T-cell
phenotype of the lymphoid cells (CD3+, CD4-, CD5+, CD8+, CD56-, Granzyme B+,
TIA-1+, Perforin-) but in situ hybridization showed no relation to Epstein-Barr
virus. Although necrotizing sialometaplasia is relatively rare in the parotid
gland, angiocentric T-cell lymphoma should be considered for a causative
condition of necrotizing sialometaplasia.
