OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of head and neck tuberculosis in
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study.
METHOD: The study included 358 patients who received a histopathologically and/or
microbiologically confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis in the head and neck region
between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011.
RESULTS: A total of 358 new cases of head and neck tuberculosis were identified
during the study period, involving 196 males (54.7 per cent) and 162 females
(45.3 per cent). These patients had a median age of 31 years (range, 3 months to 
83 years). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus was positive in 233 (65.1 per
cent) and negative in 125 (34.9 per cent). Right-sided cervical lymphadenitis was
the commonest form of presentation of head and neck tuberculosis.
CONCLUSION: In this study, right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy was the commonest
presentation of head and neck tuberculosis in both human immunodeficiency virus
infected and non-infected individuals. Head and neck tuberculosis should not be
excluded solely based on a normal chest X-ray, nor on the absence of
constitutional symptoms.
