To describe the first documented case of subacute (De Quervain) thyroiditis in
the course of novel H1N1 influenza infection. This is a case report of a patient 
diagnosed at the General Hospital "G. Hatzikosta" of Ioannina, Greece. A
55-year-old previously healthy male developed an influenza-like syndrome that was
accompanied by severe neck pain, palpitations, weight loss, and
disproportionately increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Polymerase chain
reaction assay of pharyngeal swabs confirmed the diagnosis of novel H1N1
influenza infection. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was suppressed to zero and
levels of free thyroxine and particularly triiodothyronine were increased.
Technetium-99m-pertechnetate scintigraphy showed diffuse and inhomogeneous very
low technetium trapping. The patient was treated with non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs and thyroid function gradually normalized without
evolving to a hypothyroid phase. This is the first case of subacute thyroiditis
associated with novel H1N1 influenza infection. Furthermore, this is the first
case to definitely demonstrate active influenza infection of any type concurrent 
with thyroiditis, and one of the very rare similar cases for any active viral
disease etiologically implicated in the pathogenesis of subacute thyroiditis.
