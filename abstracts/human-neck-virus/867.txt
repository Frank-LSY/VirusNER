Objectives The Notch1 signaling pathway has recently been shown to be highly
dysregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but the value of Notch1 as
a predictive biomarker is yet to be elucidated in oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC). The objective of this study is to evaluate Notch1 expression
in surgical OPSCC specimens and determine clinicopathologic correlates. Study
Design Case series with planned data collection. Setting Tertiary academic
medical center. Subjects and Methods Surgical specimens from 181 patients with
OPSCC were collected to create a tissue microarray (TMA). Human papillomavirus
(HPV) status and Notch1 expression were determined and correlated with
clinicopathologic characteristics. Results In univariate analysis, Notch1
expression correlated with improved survival as a categorical variable (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.346; P < .0001) and correlated with HPV/p16 positivity as a
continuous variable ( P < .0001). In multivariate analysis, Notch1 expression
retained significance in HPV-positive (HR, 0.303; P = .033) and HPV-negative (HR,
0.416; P = .0055) subgroups. Similarly, Notch1 expression positively correlated
with survival in p16-positive (HR, 0.469; P = .031) and p16-negative subgroups
(HR, 0.310; P = .014). Conclusions In the largest OPSCC cohort to date, we found 
that Notch1 receptor expression positively correlates with overall survival,
regardless of HPV or p16 status. Furthermore, we found higher Notch1 receptor
expression in HPV/p16-positive tumors than their HPV/p16-negative counterparts.
