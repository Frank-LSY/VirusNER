A 30-year-old Caucasian woman, without significant medical history or
immunosuppression, presented with a 7-day history of severe headache and neck
pain. The patient was presumed to have tension headache versus migraine, but was 
admitted because her symptoms did not resolve. A lumbar puncture was performed
showing lymphocytic pleocytosis suggestive of aseptic meningitis and the patient 
was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir. After admission, a rash 
was discovered on her left lumbar region with vesicles on top of an erythematous 
base. Varicella PCR was conducted on the patient's cerebrospinal fluid which was 
positive. Upon further history, patient was found to have previous varicella
infection as a child, but no prior episodes of dermatomal zoster. Therefore, this
patient was found to have aseptic meningitis and cutaneous manifestation of
disseminated varicella-zoster despite immunocompetence. Antibacterial treatment
was discontinued and she was continued on acyclovir for 7 days with transition to
valacyclovir for 2 additional weeks with good treatment response and symptom
resolution.
