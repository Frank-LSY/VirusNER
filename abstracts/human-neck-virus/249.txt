BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer
(OPC) have improved survival when compared with those with HPV-negative OPC.
Unfortunately, the American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition (AJCC-7ed) 
staging system does not account for the prognostic advantage observed with
HPV-positive OPC. The purpose of the current study was to validate and compare 2 
recently proposed staging systems for HPV-positive OPC.
METHODS: Patients treated for HPV-positive OPC from 2005 to 2015 at Johns Hopkins
Hospital (JHH) were included for analysis. The International Collaboration on
Oropharyngeal cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S) and The University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) staging systems were applied and survival was
calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard regression was
used to determine the relationship between stage of disease and survival. Models 
were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were eligible for analysis. There was a dramatic
shift in lymph node category and overall stage of disease when ICON-S and MDACC
stage were applied to the JHH cohort. There was superior stratification of
overall survival and progression-free survival by ICON-S stage. Both proposed
models had an improved fit based on AIC scores (P<.001 for both) over the
AJCC-7ed. The ICON-S staging system had the lowest AIC score, and thus a better
fit within the JHH population.
CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis provides external validation for both staging
systems in an independent and heterogeneously treated patient population.
Although the MDACC staging system is an improvement over the AJCC-7ed, the ICON-S
stage provides superior stratification of overall and progression-free survival, 
thereby supporting its use as the updated AJCC staging system for OPC. Cancer
