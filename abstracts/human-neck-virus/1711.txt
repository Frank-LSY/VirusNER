Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) originating from human
papillomavirus infection has emerged as a new entity in head and neck cancer,
defining a subset of patients with distinct carcinogenesis, risk factor profiles,
and clinical presentation that show markedly improved survival than patients with
classic OPSCC. De-escalation of therapy and identification of relevant biomarkers
to aid in patient selection are actively being investigated. This review
addresses the implications of these findings in clinical care.
