OBJECTIVES: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) continues to increase over time, challenging healthcare
providers to address their patients' HPV-related concerns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study assessed health literacy, HPV
knowledge, utilization and trust in information sources among patients with
incident HPV-positive or HPV-negative OSCC diagnosed at the Ohio State University
from 2011 to 2015. Health literacy was assessed with a standardized scale.
Additional questions evaluated HPV knowledge (including transmission, prevalence,
health consequences and treatment), the frequency and type of information sources
sought, and trust in those sources.
RESULTS: Surveys were collected from 372 OSCC cases (HPV-positive, n=188;
HPV-negative, n=184). Despite high mean health literacy scores, only 45.2% of
HPV-related knowledge questions were answered correctly. HPV was known to be a
sexually transmitted infection and a cause of cervical and anal cancer by 66.0%, 
56.5% and 15.2%, respectively. In all domains, cases with HPV-positive OSCC were 
significantly more informed than HPV-negative cases (for all, p<0.01). Only 52.7%
and 56.2% of patients with HPV-positive OSCC felt they knew enough to be
comfortable discussing HPV with their doctor or sexual partner, respectively. The
most frequently used information source was the internet (80.9%), which ranked
8th in trust of 15 possible sources. Although most (95.5%) patients trusted
information from their doctors, only 37.9% used doctors as an information source.
CONCLUSIONS: Doctors are a highly trusted, but infrequent utilized, information
source and should facilitate patient access to high-quality HPV information
sources.
