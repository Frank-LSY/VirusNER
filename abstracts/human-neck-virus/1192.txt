BACKGROUND: New cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are
routinely tested for HPV. HPV in saliva can be detected with PCR, but its
clinical applicability in the context of OPSCC remains unknown.
METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients diagnosed with OPSCC had pre-treatment
saliva specimens collected. PCR for HPV on saliva was compared to p16 IHC and HPV
DNA in situ hybridisation (ISH) on surgical biopsies.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of saliva testing when compared to the
reference test of p16 IHC and HPV DNA ISH were 72.2% and 90%, and positive and
negative predictive values were 96.3% and 47.4%. There were no adverse events.
Time from last meal, smoking, alcohol drinking and physical exercise did not
impact on results.
CONCLUSIONS: Saliva testing is a promising test to detect HPV in patients with
OPSCC. A positive result could avoid the need for surgical biopsies, thereby
reducing costs, patient morbidity and expedite treatment.
