Periodontal diseases are caused by bacteria with an inflammatory component that
result in the loss of bone and soft tissue around the neck of the teeth. Recent
therapies allow clinicians to regenerate some of the lost structures of the
periodontium. Regeneration of these lost supporting structures is a highly
orchestrated process, involving various cellular and molecular players, leading
to the complete restoration of the periodontium (the tooth-supporting apparatus).
The introduction of growth factors has positively influenced the clinical outcome
of the existing regenerative procedures but the supra-physiological doses and the
high cost associated with these growth factors can be drawbacks. Gene therapy may
offer some interesting advantages to current therapies. In the field of
periodontology, several studies have been conducted to explore the efficacy of
delivering the DNA of key growth factors using viral vectors in both periodontal 
and peri-implant bone regeneration. Relatively few studies have explored the
application of nonviral gene therapy in periodontal regeneration. This article is
aimed at reviewing the studies conducted so far using viral and nonviral gene
delivery approaches to achieve periodontal and peri-implant bone regeneration.
