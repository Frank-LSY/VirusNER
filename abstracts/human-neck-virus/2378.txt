The assessment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has recently emerged as a
prognostic biomarker in several solid tumors. Quantification and subtyping of
TILs reflects the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to 
either tumoral immune attack or escape and thereby affecting outcome. Despite the
growing evidence of its value as prognosticator, TILs analysis has not yet found 
its way to daily clinical practice. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether
the current knowledge on TILs in head and neck cancer justifies its clinical
implementation. Therefore, we summarize the data on TILs in squamous cell cancer 
of the head and neck with focus on the most important subsets (T lymphocytes and 
more specifically CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells) and
site-specific characteristics such as Human Papilloma Virus infection. In
addition, we discuss methodological problems and pitfalls that can account for
discordant findings and that may hamper inclusion of TILs assessment in routine
practice of pathologists and oncologists.
