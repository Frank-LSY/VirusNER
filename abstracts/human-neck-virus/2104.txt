BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study re-evaluated the prognostic value of HPV
status for loco-regional control (LRC), metastases-free survival (MFS), and
survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (SCCHN). A modified definition of HPV positivity was used in the
current study compared to the authors' previous study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the previous study of the same 170 patients, a tumor was
defined as HPV-positive if it showed a positive in situ hybridization result in
≥10% of tumor cells and/or positive p16 immunostaining. In the current analysis, 
tumors were considered HPV-positive only if they showed positive results for both
in situ hybridization and p16 immunostaining. In addition to HPV status, the same
11 potential prognostic factors were investigated for treatment outcomes as in
the preceding study.
RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis of the current study, HPV positivity was
significantly associated with improved LRC [risk ratio (RR) 9.78; p<0.001], MFS
(RR 7.17; p=0.008), and OS (RR 6.61; p<0.001). In the previous study, HPV
positivity was associated with LRC (RR 2.34; p=0.014) and OS (RR 2.19; p=0.019), 
but not with MFS (RR 2.04; p=0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Applying the new definition of HPV positivity, the impact of HPV
status on the prognosis of patients irradiated for locally advanced SCCHN was
more prominent than in our previous study and associated with all three
investigated endpoints.
