BACKGROUND: Many chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients recall an upper
respiratory tract infection as the inciting event of their chronic illness. Viral
infections have been shown to cause obstruction of the osteomeatal complex, which
is likely to be a critical step in the development of CRS. There is clear overlap
between the pathogenesis of CRS and asthma. Infections with respiratory viruses
in childhood increase the risk of subsequently developing asthma. Viral
infections in established asthmatics are associated with acute exacerbations. We 
sought to determine whether respiratory viruses could be detected within the
sinonasal mucosa of CRS patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
techniques.
METHODS: Sinus mucosa was sampled from 13 patients with CRS and 2 patients with
normal sinuses. PCR was used to look for common respiratory viruses
(parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; human
metapneumovirus [hMPV]; adenovirus [ADV]; rhinovirus; coronavirus; bocavirus
[BoV]; cytomegalovirus [CMV]; and influenza A and B).
RESULTS: No respiratory viruses were detected in any of the samples.
CONCLUSION: Persistence of respiratory viruses within the sinonasal mucosa is
unlikely to be a cause of ongoing inflammation in CRS. The possibility remains
that a transient viral infection provides the initial inflammatory stimulus.
