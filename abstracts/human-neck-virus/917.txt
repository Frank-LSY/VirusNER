The aim of the present study was to compare HPV16 detection by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in relation to the quantity and quality of DNA
isolated from 21 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) head and neck cancer
tissues by three commercially available kits: EX-WAX™ DNA Extraction Kit (M)
(Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), QIAamp(®) DNA FFPE Tissue (Q) (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and ReliaPrep™ FFPE gDNA Miniprep System (P) (Promega, Madison, 
USA). Quantity of extracted DNA was assessed spectrophometrically and
fluorometrically. Its quality was analyzed using A260/280 and A260/230 ratios and
the β-actin fragment amplifiability in qPCR. HPV16 presence was detected by qPCR,
using specific primers and TaqMan probe. HPV infection was found in 8 DNA samples
extracted with M kit (38.1%) and in 7 (33.3%) isolated with Q and P kits. Three
samples from M and Q kits were characterized by HPV16 positivity and lack of
β-actin amplifiability. They had significantly lower A260/280 ratio (M: 1.6±0.0, 
p=0.044 and Q: 1.7±0.0, p=0.016) compared to samples with both fragments
amplification (M: 1.7±0.0 and Q: 1.9±0.0). Therefore, for HPV detection by qPCR
in FFPE tissues we recommend ReliaPrep™ FFPE gDNA Miniprep System.
