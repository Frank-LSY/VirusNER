We report 2 observations in young girls who, after exposure to domestic rats from
the same pet shop, presented with inflammatory and necrotic skin wounds in the
neck and face. Since lesions did not improve with antibiotic therapy, surgical
excision of necrosis healed the wounds, with a 2nd intervention necessary in 1
patient. All bacteriological investigations appeared to be negative; finally,
electron microscopy of excised subepidermal tissue and PCR characterization
provided the diagnosis of cowpox virus (CPXV) infection. CPXV is part of the
Orthopox virus genus, like variola virus, and is generally transmitted to humans 
by infected cats or rodents. CPXV infection should be kept in mind when macular, 
vesicular, or necrotic cutaneous wounds do not improve with antibiotics.
