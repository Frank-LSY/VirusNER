BACKGROUND: The transcription factor high-mobility AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is involved 
in stem cell renewal and is expressed in many tumor tissues. Head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) comprise tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract
and are characterized by high recurrence rates that represent a challenge to
patient management. The study addresses the potential of HMGA2 as a molecular
biomarker for HNSCC patient survival.
METHODS: Patients with HNSCC of the larynx, pharynx, tonsils, or oral cavity were
recruited in a hospital-based case-control study (n = 202). Quantitative
expression of HMGA2 in tumor tissues was measured by RT-PCR. In a 6- to 10-year
follow-up, secondary cancers, vital status, and cause of death were ascertained. 
The HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall, tumor-specific, and
progression-free survival were estimated by Cox proportional hazards with HMGA2
expression level as the independent variable.
RESULTS: High HMGA2 expression in tumor tissues of HNSCC patients was
significantly correlated with negative HPV status (P = 0.01), and associated with
shorter overall survival time. In Cox regression modeling, HMGA2 expression
yielded a risk increase for overall and tumor-specific death in subsets of HNSCC 
patients, that is, laryngeal cancer patients (overall survival: HR = 4.00; 95%
CI, 1.18-13.62) and in oral cancer patients (tumor-specific survival: HR = 2.88; 
95% CI, 1.06-7.84), but not in patients with pharyngeal and tonsillar HNSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: HMGA2 expression is associated with a risk increase for adverse
outcomes in patients with HNSCC of the larynx and oral cavity.
IMPACT: The understanding of stem cell signaling in HNSCC may offer new
strategies for cancer treatment. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(2);
