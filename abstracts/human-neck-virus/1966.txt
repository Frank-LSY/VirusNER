BACKGROUND: Pathogenic bacteria have been cultured from the osteomeatal complex
(OMC) in one-third of adults with apparent acute bacterial sinusitis; however, it
is not known whether bacteria are present in the OMC during uncomplicated viral
colds in adults.
METHODS: Adult volunteers were recruited for a study during wellness and at the
time of acute common cold. Swab cultures were obtained from the OMC and from the 
nasopharynx by 2 routes (through the nose and through the mouth). Swab eluates
were inoculated on selective agars to detect S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M.
catarrhalis.
RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in the OMC more frequently during
common colds than during wellness (31% vs 8%, p < 0.008). Pathogens detected in
the OMC were always present in the nasopharynx of the subject.
CONCLUSION: Bacterial pathogens are present in the OMC in a subgroup of adult
patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory illness/common cold. The
nasopharynx appears to be the reservoir for bacterial pathogens in the OMC.
