Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an essential causal factor in a subset of head and 
neck neoplasms, most notably oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, for which HPV
infection has important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.
This article summarizes the current understanding of HPV-associated neoplasms of 
the head and neck, including the recently described carcinoma with adenoid
cystic-like features. Salient clinical, gross, and microscopic features are
discussed, and the utility of specific ancillary studies is highlighted.
