Strong evidence has accumulated in the last 15 years showing that infection by
certain human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is etiologically involved in a subset of
head and neck cancers (HNCs). In this chapter, epidemiologic-related topics on
HNCs are reviewed: (i) HPV-attributable fractions and HPV-type distributions by
different anatomical HNC sites, using not only HPV DNA but other more specific
markers of causality; (ii) an update of the HPV-related HNCs burden worldwide and
by regions; and finally, (iii) the determinants for HPV positivity in HNCs,
focussing on gender, age, smoking habits, sexual behavior, and other related
factors such as tonsillectomy performance. This information is essential in order
to understand the burden of the disease and its dynamics and changing patterns,
as well as for planning and assessment of the potential impact of HPV-based
preventive strategies for HNCs.
