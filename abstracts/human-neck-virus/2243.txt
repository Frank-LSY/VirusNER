OBJECTIVE: To predict sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and neurological
impairment in congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection using MR imaging and
define the best timing in pregnancy for prenatal assessment.
METHODS: In 121 patients with confirmed cCMV infection, brain features at MR
imaging were respectively graded from 1 to 5: normal; isolated
frontal/parieto-occipital hyperintensity; temporal periventricular
hyperintensity; temporal/occipital cysts and/or intraventricular septa; migration
disorders. Grading was correlated with postnatal SNHL and neurological impairment
using regression analysis. In 51 fetuses with MR examinations at 26.9 and
33.0 weeks, the predictive value of SNHL and neurological impairment was compared
using ROC curves.
RESULTS: Postnatal follow-up showed SNHL in 18 infants and neurological
impairment in 10. MR grading was predictive of SNHL and of neurological
impairment (P < 0.001). In grade 1 or 2, none had SNHL and 1/74 had neurological 
impairment. The areas under ROC curves for prediction of postnatal SNHL and of
neurological impairment from first and second MR examination were comparable.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in cCMV infection, prediction of SNHL and
neurological impairment is feasible by fetal MR imaging with a high negative
predictive value and can equally be done at 27 or 33 weeks of gestation.
KEY POINTS: • In cCMV, isolated periventricular T2-weighted signal hyperintensity
has a good postnatal prognosis. • In cCMV, SNHL and neurological impairment can
be predicted at 27 or 33 weeks. • In cCMV, fetal MR has a high NPV in predicting 
SNHL. • In cCMV, fetal MR has a high NPV in predicting neurological impairment.
