OBJECTIVES: To evaluate for the first time the prevalence of human papillomavirus
in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a Middle-Eastern population, and to
determine associations between human papillomavirus profiles and
clinicopathological characteristics.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients treated for
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma at the Hotel Dieu de France University
Hospital (Beirut, Lebanon) between January 2010 and 2016. Existing formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumour samples were analysed. Human papillomavirus DNA viral
load and p16 expression were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction and
immunohistochemistry respectively.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (mean age of 60 years) were included. Twenty-seven per
cent of patients were p16-positive/human papillomavirus DNA positive, 53 per cent
were p16-negative/human papillomavirus DNA negative and 20 per cent were
p16-positive/human papillomavirus DNA negative. Human papillomavirus 16 was the
most frequent subtype (75 per cent). Smoking and alcohol consumption were
significantly lower in the human papillomavirus positive group compared to the
human papillomavirus negative group (p = 0.049 and 0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus rate was lower than reported rates in Western
populations. Possible explanations include differences in social and cultural
behaviours.
