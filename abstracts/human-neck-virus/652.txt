PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth
most common cancer worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis
remains poor. HNSCC comprise a wide spectrum of neoplasms with different tumor
biologies, prognosis and response to therapies. Current tumor classification is
based on morphology and anatomic distribution, which leads to a homogeneous
treatment for different diseases. Moreover, traditional diagnostic methods such
as clinical assessment, histopathological examination, and imaging techniques are
limited in their capacity to provide information on prognosis and decision
making.
RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular markers have increased the understanding of the
pathogenesis of head and neck cancer because they give increasing insight into
tumor biology, prognosis, and response to therapy. The practical application of
these discoveries is beginning to assist greatly in the evaluation and treatment 
of HNSCC to achieve a more personalized and effective approach.
SUMMARY: This article focuses on the molecular markers that have already been
extensively studied such as epidermal growth factor receptor and human
papillomavirus as well as those that offer potential for personalized therapy
such as HIF-1 and ERCC-1. The ideal biomarker should be assayed accurately and
easily, highly specific, and cost effective. Thus, a validation is required
before their implementation into clinical guidelines.
