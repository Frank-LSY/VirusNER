IMPORTANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known causative agent for
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Whereas it is becoming more firmly
established that HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated
with better survival outcomes, believed to be because of better response to
chemoradiation therapy, the specific mechanisms for these improved survival
outcomes remain underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between HPV status and promoter
methylation in an OPSCC cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction was used to examine oncogenic HPV type 16 in a retrospective cohort of
121 patients with primary OPSCC. Aberrant promoter methylation of IGSF4, DAPK1,
and ESR1 genes, known to be methylated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 
including OPSCC, was examined by means of quantitative methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients received standard therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Univariate associations between HPV and methylation
were analyzed using Fisher exact tests followed by multivariable logistic
regression. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to model the risk of
death given age, race, sex, HPV status, methylation, stage, smoking, and
treatment.
RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression analyses, HPV-positive status was
significantly associated with Caucasian race (P = .02), treatment (radiotherapy
only, P = .01; chemoradiotherapy, P = .007), and IGSF4 methylation (P = .005).
The final multivariate logistic model, after controlling for patient
characteristics (sex, age, smoking, race, and treatment) with backward variable
selection among genes, retained IGSF4 methylation (OR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.6-12.8];
P = .005), Caucasian race (OR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.0-8.3]; P = .053), treatment
(radiotherapy only vs neither: OR, 11.62 [95% CI, 2.02-66.82]; P = .02;
chemoradiotherapy vs neither: OR, 11.15 [95% CI, 1.92-64.65]; P = .01), male sex 
(OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.3-17.0]; P = .02), and younger age (OR, 0.9 [95% CI,
0.90-1.0]; P = .008) as independent predictors of HPV-positive status. Cox
regression modeling indicated HPV-negative status, age, male sex, smoking, and
radiation treatment as independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Methylation of IGSF4 is an independent predictor of
HPV-positive status. DNA methylation in conjunction with HPV infection appears to
play a role in OPSCC.
