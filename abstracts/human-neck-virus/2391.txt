Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, widely known as the necessary cause of
cervical cancer, has been established as a major etiologic factor for head and
neck cancer (HNC). HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV-associated 
cancers than the general population. We describe a 45-year-old man with HIV and
HPV coinfection, who presented progressively enlarging verrucous neoformations of
the lips. The final diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma was delayed. Early detection
of HPV lesions in oral mucosa and HPV screening activities could be important in 
improving the diagnostic sensitivity for the HIV-infected patients with oral
cancer.
