Human papillomaviruses (HPVs), especially type 16, are implicated in the
development of a subset of head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). This
subset of oropharyngeal cancers possesses distinct clinical and laboratory
features and outcome, and is particularly common in individuals who lack the
traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol abuse. Moreover, the annual
incidence of HPV-related HNSCCs has increased in the USA and Europe in the last
few years. As HPV-associated HNSCCs share a better prognosis compared with
stage-matched HPV-negative ones, selected patients could be spared the intensive 
and toxic treatment and be oriented to organ preservation strategies. Preventive 
HPV vaccines have already been designed against cervical cancer, and a further
understanding of HPV-associated carcinogenesis could potentially lead to the
development of HPV-targeted therapeutic strategies. This study summarizes the
current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, biology, malignant transformation
mechanisms, and prognosis of HPV-associated HNSCCs, and underlines the clinical
implications of related treatments and prophylactic strategies.
