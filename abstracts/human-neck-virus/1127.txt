BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that rates of human papillomavirus related
oropharyngeal cancer (HPVOPC) in the US are higher in Caucasians than minorities.
We hypothesized that this disparity would be less marked in a racially and
ethnically diverse population from New York City.
METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 210 patients with biopsied or
surgically treated OPC at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS)
between 1999 and 2013. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the
presence of HPV-DNA in paraffin-embedded tumor blocks. Incidence of HPV-positive 
cancers was compared between Caucasians and minorities (defined as African
Americans, Asians, and Hispanics) using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: We found a higher incidence of HPV-positive OPC in Caucasians than
racial minorities within the ISMMS population (p=0.002). HPV incidence detected
by PCR was 139/165 [84.2%] for Caucasians and 28/45 [62.2%] for minorities.
Specifically, there was a higher rate in Caucasians compared to African Americans
(p=0.017), but no significant difference between Caucasians and Hispanics
(p=0.087).
CONCLUSION: We documented a disparity in incidence of HPVOPC amongst racial
groups, consistent with previously reported trends from study populations in less
urbanized areas. Thus we conclude that the factors underlying racial/ethnic
disparities in HPVOPC incidence are likely to be similar across communities with 
different levels of urbanization and population diversity.
