Evidence on the association between dietary component, dietary pattern and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is scarce. A major challenge is the high degree of
correlation among dietary constituents. We aimed to identify dietary pattern
associated with NPC and to illustrate the dose-response relationship between the 
identified dietary pattern scores and the risk of NPC. Taking advantage of a
matched NPC case-control study, data from a total of 319 incident cases and 319
matched controls were analyzed. Dietary pattern was derived employing partial
least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) performed on energy-adjusted food
frequencies derived from a 66-item food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with multiple conditional
logistic regression models, linking pattern scores and NPC risk. A high score of 
the PLS-DA derived pattern was characterized by high intakes of fruits, milk,
fresh fish, vegetables, tea, and eggs ordered by loading values. We observed that
one unit increase in the scores was associated with a significantly lower risk of
NPC (ORadj = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60-0.88) after controlling for potential
confounders. Similar results were observed among Epstein-Barr virus seropositive 
subjects. An NPC protective diet is indicated with more phytonutrient-rich plant 
foods (fruits, vegetables), milk, other protein-rich foods (in particular fresh
fish and eggs), and tea. This information may be used to design potential dietary
regimen for NPC prevention.
