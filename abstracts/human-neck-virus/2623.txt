Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for increasing incidence of
oropharyngeal cancer. At present, there are no biomarkers in the surveillance
algorithm for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC). HPV16 E6 antibody
precedes oropharyngeal cancer diagnosis. If HPV16 E6 indeed precedes primary
diagnosis, it is similarly expected to precede disease recurrence and may have a 
potential role as a biomarker for surveillance of HPV-OPC. To determine whether
HPV antibody titers have a potential role as early markers of disease recurrence 
or prognosis, a retrospective pilot study was designed to determine whether HPV16
early antibody titers E6, E7, E1, and E2 decrease after treatment of
HPV16-positive OPC. Trends in pretreatment, early (≤6 months after treatment),
and late posttreatment (>6 months after treatment) HPV16 antibody titers were
examined. There were 43, 34, and 52 subjects with serum samples available for
pretreatment, early, and late posttreatment intervals. Mean pretreatment antibody
levels were higher than posttreatment antibody levels. Average antibody levels
decreased significantly over time for E6 (Ptrend = 0.001) and E7 (Ptrend <
0.001). Six disease recurrences were observed during the follow-up period
(median, 4.4 years). In univariate analysis, a log-unit increase in pretreatment 
E6 titer was significantly associated with increased risk of disease recurrence
(HR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.1-25.7; P = 0.03). Therefore, levels of antibodies to HPV16 
early oncoproteins decline after therapy. Higher E6 titers at diagnosis are
associated with significant increases in the risk of recurrence. These data
support the prospective evaluation of HPV16 antibodies as markers of surveillance
and for risk stratification at diagnosis.
