Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignant tumour of the
oral cavity. The aetiology of epithelial cancer of the head and neck is
considered to be a multifactorial, sequential process. DNA viruses are found in
many different cancers and are also capable of transforming cells to a malignant 
phenotype. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been proposed as risk factors in OSCC 
development and HPV type 16 is the most important subtype. Other oncogenic virus 
species i.e., Epstein-Barr Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 have been
proposed to be involved in oral carcinogenesis. However, no convincing evidence
exist that they are an established risk factor in OSCC. Therefore more studies
are needed in order to clarify the different aspects of virus involvement. Here, 
we review the existing literature on viral involvement in oral cancer.
