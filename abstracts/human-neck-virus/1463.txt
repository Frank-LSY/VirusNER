OBJECTIVE: To conduct high-throughput mutational analysis in 6 commonly used head
and neck cancer cell lines. Comprehensive mutation analysis of primary head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors has recently been reported, and
mutations in the NOTCH receptors, TP53 and CDKN2A, were key findings. Established
cell lines are valuable tools to study cancer in vitro. Similar high-throughput
mutational analysis of head and neck cancer cell lines is necessary to confirm
their mutational profile.
DESIGN: DNA was extracted from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) cell lines
Cal27, Detroit562, FaDu, SCC4, SCC15, and SCC25. Cell line identity was confirmed
by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
status was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 535
cancer-associated genes were sequenced through a limited exome capture on the
Illumina HiSeq system.
SETTING: London Regional Cancer Program.
RESULTS: The identity of the 6 cell lines was confirmed by STR analysis, and all 
lines tested negative for HPV infection. We achieved an average of 129-fold
coverage with paired-end 100 base-pair reads. Sequencing revealed an average of
38 damaging mutations in each cell line (range, 30-45). The TP53 mutations,
predicted to confer loss of function, were noted in all cell lines, and damaging 
CDKN2A mutations were found in all lines except SCC15.
CONCLUSIONS: High-throughput sequencing of head and neck cancer cell lines
revealed similar mutations to those observed in primary tumors. Thus, these lines
reflect the tumor biology of HNSCC and can serve as valuable models to study
HNSCC in vitro.
