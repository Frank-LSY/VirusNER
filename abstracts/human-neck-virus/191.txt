We observed a high prevalence of beta human papillomavirus DNA in malignant tumors. In contrast, polyomavirus DNA was present in benign, malignant, and non-tumor control samples. Most striking was the significant distribution of herpesvirus DNA in the SGT samples, in particular the high prevalence of Epstein-Barr type 1 and type 2 DNA in Warthin's tumor samples.
