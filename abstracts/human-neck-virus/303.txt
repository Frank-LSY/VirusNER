Oncolytic virotherapy has been an attractive drug platform for targeted therapy
of cancer over the past few years. Viral vectors can be used to target and lyse
cancer cells, but achieving good efficacy and specificity with this treatment
approach is a major challenge. Here, we assessed the ability of a novel
dual-specific anti-tumor oncolytic adenovirus, expressing the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene from the Newcastle disease virus under the 
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter (Ad-hTERTp-E1a-HN), to
inhibit esophageal cancer EC-109 cells in culture and to reduce tumor burden in
xenografted BALB/c nude mice. In vitro, infection with Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN could
inhibit the growth of EC-109 cells significantly and also protect normal human
liver cell line L02 from growth suppression in
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays.
Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN also effectively and selectively decreased the sialic acid level 
on EC-109 cells, but not on L02 cells. Furthermore, Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN was shown to 
induce the apoptosis pathway via acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining
(AO/EB staining), increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduce mitochondrial
membrane potential and release cytochrome c. In vivo, xenografted BALB/c nude
mice were treated via intratumoral or intravenous injections of Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN. 
Although both treatments showed an obvious suppression in tumor volume, only
Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN delivered via intratumoral injection elicited a complete response
to treatment. These results reinforced previous findings and highlighted the
potential therapeutic application of Ad-hTERT-E1a-HN for treatment of esophageal 
cancer in clinical trials.
