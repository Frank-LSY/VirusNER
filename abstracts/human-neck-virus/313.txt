Two hundred twenty-one samples were strictly classified to the subsites of oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx at the time of primary surgery. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were subjected to a validated, tiered, diagnostic algorithm of p16 immunohistochemistry, high-risk HPV in situ hybridization, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for HPV E6 DNA. An additional 60 oropharyngeal cases acted as an internal biological control.
