Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause virtually all cervical cancers, the second
leading cause of death by cancer among women, as well as other anogenital cancers
and a subset of head and neck cancers. Approximately half of women, who develop
cervical cancer die from it. Despite the optimism that has accompanied the
introduction of prophylactic vaccines to prevent some HPV infections, the
relatively modest uptake of the vaccine, especially in the developing world, and 
the very high fraction of men and women who are already infected, means that
HPV-associated disease will remain as a significant public health problem for
decades. In this review, we summarize some recent findings on HPV-associated
carcinogenesis, such as miRNAs in HPV-associated cancers, implication of stem
cells in the biology and therapy of HPV-positive cancers, HPV vaccines, targeted 
therapy of cervical cancer, and drug treatment for HPV-induced intraepithelial
neoplasias.
