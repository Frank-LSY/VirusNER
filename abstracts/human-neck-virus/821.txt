BACKGROUND: Oral leukoplakia is considered as a premalignant lesion for the
development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); several risks factors have
been reported to contribute to this step-wise carcinogenesis; including human
papillomavirus (HPV). Nevertheless, few reports have analyzed both the HPV status
and the genotype in a single individual who develops OSCC from pre-existing oral 
leukoplakia. In this study, we surveyed the HPV status, genotype and
clinicopathological risk factors in cases of malignant transformation from
pre-existing oral leukoplakia.
METHODS: HPV genomic DNA was detected by PCR (MY09/MY11 in conjugation with
nested primer-GP05+/GP06+) from paraffin sections, and the genotype was
determined by direct DNA sequencing. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression 
were used to analyze risk factors for malignant transformation of oral cavity
leukoplakia.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven patients with oral leukoplakia were
enrolled; including 12 who had malignant transformation from the pre-existing
oral leukoplakia. HPV prevalence was 22.8% in cases with oral leukoplakia. The
risk factor associated with malignant transformation was recurrence of
leukoplakia after treatment (p=0.03), nevertheless, HPV status was not
statistically significant by logistic regression analysis. Among these 12
patients with malignant transformation from pre-existing oral leukoplakia, the
status or genotype of HPV was chaotic; the oral habits of these patients might
contribute to malignant transformation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HPV in oral leukoplakia is no prognostic
indicator of malignant transformation.
