Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck belong to the most common cancers
worldwide. Although they are in general on the decline, rising incidence rates
have been reported for certain specific sites. In developed countries the impact 
of classical risk factors like tobacco and alcohol seems to decline, while the
association with oncogenic papillomavirus infections, in particular in cancers of
the oropharynx, is increasing markedly. The accumulation of genetic and
epigenetic changes due to toxin exposure leads to inactivation of tumor
suppressors or activation of proto-oncogenes, resulting in genetic instability
and malignant transformation in non-papillomavirus-related cancer.
Papillomavirus-related cancers infrequently contain genetic alterations and are
caused by deregulation of the cell cycle, senescence and apoptosis induced by
viral oncoproteins. Detection of oncogenic papillomavirus infections may be basis
for further classification of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and could be 
a key in differential treatment modalities for subsets of head and neck cancer in
the near future.
