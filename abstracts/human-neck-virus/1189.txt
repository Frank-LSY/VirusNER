BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) has a better outcome than most head neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs) and an HPV-positive lymph node metastasis likely has an HPV-positive
oropharyngeal SCC origin. Determining HPV-status in cervical lymph nodes by
fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) may be useful for diagnosis.
METHODS: FNACs from 66 patients with neck masses were prospectively examined for 
HPV DNA and HPV16 mRNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, and the 
data correlated to diagnosis and HPV-status obtained from histopathological
specimens.
RESULTS: Aspirates from 17 of 66 patients, later diagnosed with HPV-positive
oropharyngeal SCC, were HPV16 DNA-positive. HPV16 mRNA was detected in all cases 
with extractable RNA. All remaining FNACs, including 18 branchial cleft cysts,
were HPV DNA-negative. HPV DNA status in the aspirates showed perfect concordance
with corresponding biopsies.
CONCLUSION: HPV16 DNA detection in fine-needle aspirations from neck masses is
reliable and HPV16 DNA in a metastasis is a strong indicator of an HPV-positive
oropharyngeal SCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 419-426, 2017.
