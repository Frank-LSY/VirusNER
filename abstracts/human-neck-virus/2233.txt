OBJECTIVES: Calcification of the torus tubarius has been rarely reported in the
literature. Histopathologic studies have previously described cases of Eustachian
tube calcification and cite an association with increasing patient age. The
purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of torus tubarius
calcification and potential clinical significance on an unrestricted patient
population using thin-section computed tomography (CT), which has not been
previously reported.
METHODS: After the institutional review board approval, 1571 consecutive patients
who underwent noncontrast head CT between January 2011 and July 2011 were
retrospectively reviewed for torus tubarius calcification. Images were acquired
at 1.25-mm slice thickness using a 64-detector row CT. Medical records were
reviewed for chronic medical conditions including chronic kidney disease,
alcoholism, autoimmune conditions, endocrine disorders, elevated alkaline
phosphatase levels, history of otitis media, purified protein derivative
positivity, history of head and neck surgery and radiation, and human
immunodeficiency virus infection. Motion-limited studies and patients with
limited clinical data were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using
the independent sample t test and Fisher exact test.
RESULTS: Ten (0.6%) of 1571 patients had torus tubarius calcification, of which 7
(70%) were unilateral, and 3 (30%) were bilateral calcification. There was no
significant association between torus tubarius calcification and common medical
disorders including endocrine disorders, human immunodeficiency virus, chronic
kidney disease, alcoholism, purified protein derivative positivity, history of
head and neck surgery or radiation, and autoimmune diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the largest series to date on an unrestricted population
using thin-section CT imaging, calcification of the torus tubarius is a rare
entity with an overall prevalence of 0.6%. Although the clinical significance
remains uncertain, there is no significant association between torus tubarius
calcification and common medical conditions.
