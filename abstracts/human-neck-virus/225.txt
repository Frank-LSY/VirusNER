Polymicrobial infection and bacterium-mediated epigenetic modification of DNA
tumor viruses contribute to pathogenesis.

Doolittle JM, Webster-Cyriaque J.

ABSTRACT The human body plays host to a wide variety of microbes, commensal and
pathogenic. In addition to interacting with their host, different microbes, such 
as bacteria and viruses, interact with each other, sometimes in ways that
exacerbate disease. In particular, gene expression of a number of viruses,
including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is known to be regulated by
epigenetic modifications induced by bacteria. These viruses establish latent
infection in their host cells and can be reactivated by bacterial products. Viral
reactivation has been suggested to contribute to periodontal disease and AIDS. In
addition, bacterium-virus interactions may play a role in cancers, such as
Kaposi's sarcoma, gastric cancer, and head and neck cancer. It is important to
consider the effects of coexisting bacterial infections when studying viral
diseases in vivo.
