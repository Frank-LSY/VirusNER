In epithelial tumors, a shift towards a mesenchymal phenotype has been associated
with increased invasiveness and metastasis. It is assumed that this phenomenon
plays a major role in disease progression and ultimately prognosis. This study
investigated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human papillomavirus-
(HPV-) negative pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Tissue was obtained from one 
hypopharyngeal primary tumor and a regional lymph node metastasis during surgery 
with curative intention. A cell culture was established from the primary tumor
and mesenchymal growth conditions were emulated. Gene expression profiling was
performed (Human 8 × 60 K design array, Agilent Technologies) and EMT was
assessed by a gene set (MSigDB: M5930,
Hallmark_epithelial_mesenchymal_transition), applying gene set expression
analysis (GSEA). Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry of CD44 and
E-cadherin were compared in primary tumor, metastasis, and cell cultures. Primary
tumor and metastasis were highly positive for CD44. A loss of E-cadherin occurred
in the metastasis. Flow cytometry showed the appearance of a population without
E-cadherin in spheroid colonies. In GSEA, the EMT phenotype was enriched in the
primary tumor compared to metastasis and cell cultures (FDR < 25%, p < 5%). EMT
showed variable expression during metastasis. It may thereby be a dynamic state
in HPV-negative pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma that is active only during the
process of metastasis itself. Thereby, the primary tumor as well as the
metastasis may exhibit fewer EMT properties.
