BACKGROUND: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) has been hypothesised as a risk 
factor for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but aetiological research 
has been limited by the varying methodology used for establishing HPV prevalence.
The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the
prevalence of HPV DNA detected in OSCC tumours and the influence of study
characteristics.
METHODS: Study-level estimates of overall and type-specific HPV prevalence were
meta-analysed to obtain random-effects summary estimates.
RESULTS: This analysis included 124 studies with a total of 13â€‰832 OSCC cases.
The average HPV prevalence (95% confidence interval) among OSCC cases was 0.277
(0.234, 0.320) by polymerase chain reaction; 0.243 (0.159, 0.326) by in situ
hybridisation; 0.304 (0.185, 0.423) by immunohistochemistry; 0.322 (0.154, 0.490)
by L1 serology; and 0.176 (0.061, 0.292) by Southern/slot/dot blot. The highest
HPV prevalence was found in Africa and Asia, notably among Chinese studies from
provinces with high OSCC incidence rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on quantifying HPV in OSCC cases using 
strict quality control measures, as well as determining the association between
HPV and OSCC incidence by conducting large, population-based case-control
studies. Such studies will provide a richer understanding of the role of HPV in
OSCC aetiology.
