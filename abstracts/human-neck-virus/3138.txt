We report a case of a 40-year-old seropositive-HIV patient with a CD4 count of
120 who presented with fever, severe headache and neck stiffness. Suspecting a
case of tubercular meningitis (TBM; as tuberculosis is the commonest
opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients in India), a lumbar puncture was
performed and a cerebrospinal fluid study revealed TBM. The patient was started
on combination antitubercular drug therapy from directly observed treatment,
short course (DOTS) (Cat 1 regimen) along with pyridoxine 40 mg/day and
adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. However, despite adequate antitubercular
therapy for 4 weeks, the patient did not show any improvement in his clinical
condition. On the contrary, in the process he developed cytomegalovirus (CMV)
retinitis. So we question our learned readers if the coinfection of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and CMV should be implicated for the failure to respond to isolated 
antitubercular therapy contrary to our expectation.
