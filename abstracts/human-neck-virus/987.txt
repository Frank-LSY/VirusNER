The sinonasal tract is one of the least frequent sites for squamous cell
carcinoma in the head and neck. However, it is still a complex tumor type for
pathologists because there are numerous histologic variants with unusual
morphologic features, several non-squamous carcinomas in the differential
diagnosis that can have similar morphology and even squamous differentiation, and
because of the increasing recognition of human papillomavirus (HPV) in a subset
of the tumors. In addition, the unique and complex anatomy of the sinonasal tract
can make proper staging and management of patients' tumors quite challenging.
This article reviews sinonasal tract squamous cell carcinoma in depth and
provides the latest data on Schneiderian papillomas and HPV in their
pathogenesis.
