OBJECTIVES: Volumetric tumor growth velocity (TGV) reflects in vitro tumor
aggressiveness, but its prognostic value has not been investigated in vivo. We
examined the prognostic impact of TGV on oncologic outcomes in patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 101 OSCC patients with two pretreatment CTs with time gap 
of 2 or more weeks treated at a single institution between 2004 and 2008 were
identified. Primary tumor and nodal targets were segmented in scans. Linear
growth rates were calculated. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified
cut point associated with outcomes.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 59months (range 7-118). Median primary TGV was
0.65% increase per day (range 0-9.37%). RPA identified TGV cut point associated
with local control (LC) of 1% per day. Patients with higher TGV had decreased
5-year LC (73% vs. 98%, p=0.0004), distant control (DC, 62% vs. 91%, p=0.0007),
and overall survival (OS, 38% versus 93%, p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis
including demographics, tumor stage, subsite, and treatment factors, TGV⩾1% per
day independently predicted worsened LC (p = 0.02), DC (p = 0.003), and OS (p <
0.0001). However, this TGV cutoff was not significantly predictive of LC, DC, or 
OS for a subset of presumed HPV-positive patients.
CONCLUSION: OSCC TGV⩾1% per day is a substantive negative prognostic indicator
for disease control and overall survival, particularly in HPV non-associated
tumors. This novel CT-based volumetric assessment of TGV suggests a simple
methodology for risk stratification of patients.
