Metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has traditionally
carried a dismal prognosis; however with advances in care, it has been shown that
pulmonary metastasectomy is a viable therapeutic option in selected patients,
palliating symptoms and improving survival. With the increasing incidence of
human papilloma virus-related HNSCC and better availability of minimal access
surgery, there is a need to better understand the role of pulmonary
metastasectomy in the treatment of HNSCC. This article summarizes the literature 
on indications, results, surgical options and approaches, clinical dilemmas, and 
controversies associated with pulmonary metastasectomy in HNSCC, to identify
suitable candidates and optimize outcomes.
