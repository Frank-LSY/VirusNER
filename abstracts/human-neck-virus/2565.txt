Most squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) exhibit a persistent
activation of the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. We have recently shown that
metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug that is also used to treat lipodystrophy in 
HIV-infected (HIV(+)) individuals, diminishes mTOR activity and prevents the
progression of chemically induced experimental HNSCC premalignant lesions. Here, 
we explored the preclinical activity of metformin in HNSCCs harboring PIK3CA
mutations and HPV oncogenes, both representing frequent HNSCC alterations, aimed 
at developing effective targeted preventive strategies. The biochemical and
biologic effects of metformin were evaluated in representative HNSCC cells
expressing mutated PIK3CA or HPV oncogenes (HPV(+)). The oral delivery of
metformin was optimized to achieve clinical relevant blood levels. Molecular
determinants of metformin sensitivity were also investigated, and their
expression levels were examined in a large collection of HNSCC cases. We found
that metformin inhibits mTOR signaling and tumor growth in HNSCC cells expressing
mutated PIK3CA and HPV oncogenes, and that these activities require the
expression of organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3/SLC22A3), a metformin uptake
transporter. Coexpression of OCT3 and the mTOR pathway activation marker pS6 were
observed in most HNSCC cases, including those arising in HIV(+) patients.
Activation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway is a widespread event in HNSCC, including
HPV(-) and HPV(+) lesions arising in HIV(+) patients, all of which coexpress
OCT3. These observations may provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of
metformin to halt HNSCC development from precancerous lesions, including in
HIV(+) individuals at risk of developing HPV(-) associated cancers.
