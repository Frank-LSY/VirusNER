BACKGROUND: Despite universal healthcare in some countries, lower socioeconomic
status (SES) has been associated with worse cancer survival. The influence of SES
on head and neck cancer (HNC) survival is of immense interest, since SES is
associated with the risk and prognostic factors associated with this disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed HNC patients from 2003 to 2010 (n=2124)
were identified at Toronto's Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Principal component
analysis was used to calculate a composite score using neighbourhood-level SES
variables obtained from the 2006 Canada Census. Associations of SES with overall 
survival were evaluated in HNC subsets and by p16 status (surrogate for human
papillomavirus).
RESULTS: SES score was higher for oral cavity (n=423) and p16-positive
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC, n=404) patients compared with other disease sites.
Lower SES was associated with worse survival [HR 1.14 (1.06-1.22), p=0.0002],
larger tumor staging (p<0.001), current smoking (p<0.0001), heavier alcohol
consumption (p<0.0001), and greater comorbidity (p<0.0002), but not with
treatment regimen (p>0.20). After adjusting for age, sex, and stage, the lowest
SES quintile was associated with the worst survival only for OPC patients [HR
1.66 (1.09-2.53), n=832], primarily in the p16-negative subset [HR 1.63
(0.96-2.79)]. The predictive ability of the prognostic models improved when
smoking/alcohol was added to the model (c-index 0.71 vs. 0.69), but addition of
SES did not (c-index 0.69).
CONCLUSION: SES was associated with survival, but this effect was lost after
accounting for other factors (age, sex, TNM stage, smoking/alcohol). Lower SES
was associated with greater smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidity, and stage.
