OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the prevalence of human
papillomavirus (HPV) in mobile tongue cancer (MTC) and evaluate associations and 
survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical resection as primary
treatment for MTC (n = 127) were retrospectively evaluated. Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were assessed for p16 and p53 by
immunohistochemistry; for HPV DNA by nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using two pairs of consensus primers (MY09-MY11 and GP5+-GP6+); and for E6 
and E7 oncogenes from 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52, 56,
58, 59, 66, and 68) by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: There were 18 (14.2%) p16-positive, 45 (35.4%) p53-positive, 9 (7.1%)
HPV DNA-positive, and 7 (5.5%) E6 and/or E7 mRNA-positive tumors, but the
correlation of all pairs was poor. There was no demographic or histopathologic
association with HPV status. Cause-specific survival was significantly better
with p16-positive than with p16-negative tumors (p = .037).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPV and p16 positivity was relatively low and p16 
status was a poor surrogate marker for HPV status. The results showed the
importance of p16 expression in prognosticating mobile tongue cancer.
