INTRODUCTION: Human papilloma virus (HPV) genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 impose a
substantial burden of direct costs on the Italian National Health Service that
has never been quantified fully. The main objective of the present study was to
address this gap: (1) by estimating the total direct medical costs associated
with nine major HPV-related diseases, namely invasive cervical cancer, cervical
dysplasia, cancer of the vulva, vagina, anus, penis, and head and neck,
anogenital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and (2) by providing 
an aggregate measure of the total economic burden attributable to HPV 6, 11, 16, 
and 18 infection.
METHODS: For each of the nine conditions, we used available Italian secondary
data to estimate the lifetime cost per case, the number of incident cases of each
disease, the total economic burden, and the relative prevalence of HPV types 6,
11, 16, and 18, in order to estimate the aggregate fraction of the total economic
burden attributable to HPV infection.
RESULTS: The total direct costs (expressed in 2011 Euro) associated with the
annual incident cases of the nine HPV-related conditions included in the analysis
were estimated to be €528.6 million, with a plausible range of €480.1-686.2
million. The fraction attributable to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 was €291.0 (range
€274.5-315.7 million), accounting for approximately 55% of the total annual
burden of HPV-related disease in Italy.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provided a plausible estimate of the significant
economic burden imposed by the most prevalent HPV-related diseases on the Italian
welfare system. The fraction of the total direct lifetime costs attributable to
HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 infections, and the economic burden of noncervical
HPV-related diseases carried by men, were found to be cost drivers relevant to
the making of informed decisions about future investments in programmes of HPV
prevention.
