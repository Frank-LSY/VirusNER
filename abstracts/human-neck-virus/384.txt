HPV16 infection was found in 36 tumours (33.0%). Virus-positive patients had better OS and DFS than those without infection (P = 0.041 and 0.005). Among HPV16-positive HNSCCs, 18 (50.0%) had higher VL (median value > 6764.3 copies/cell) and 25 (73.5%) P16 over expression. The significant differences in OS and DFS (P = 0.008 and 0.004) were noticed according to VL, wherein 100% DFS was found for patients with higher VL. According to P16 expression, significant difference was found only for OS (P = 0.020). In multivariate analysis, VL (P = 0.045; HR = 2.795; CI 0.121-1.060) and the level of smoking (P = 0.023, HR = 2.253; CI 1.124-4.514) were independent factors affecting DFS of HPV16-positive patients.
