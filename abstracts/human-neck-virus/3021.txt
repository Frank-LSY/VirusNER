BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer is a
multifactorial disease caused by various carcinogens such as tobacco, alcohol and
viruses. Likewise, oxidative stress is known to cause aberrations in the cell
membrane and DNA, leading to cancer. We conducted this prospective study in order
to evaluate the level of oxidative stress in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer 
patients.
METHODS: Fifty patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer and 40 control
subjects were selected. Serum malondialdehyde concentrations and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power were assessed, in order to evaluate oxidative stress. Results
were analysed by Student's t-test.
RESULTS: Malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher and ferric reducing
antioxidant power lower in the cancer patients, compared with the controls,
indicating higher oxidative stress in the former. There was no statistically
significant difference in malondialdehyde concentration or ferric reducing
antioxidant power, comparing patients with versus without neck secondaries, and
patients with early stage versus late stage tumours.
CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress may have a role to play in the initiation of
laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, especially in patients with other risk
factors such as tobacco and alcohol use.
