OBJECTIVES: Previous reports suggest a strong association between human
papillomavirus (HPV) and the etiology of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(LSCC). However, clinical data regarding the HPV infection rate among LSCC
patients remain largely inconsistent.
METHODS: In total, 674 LSCC patients from three major hospitals in Shanghai were 
enrolled in this study. We determined the patients' HPV infection status using
immunohistochemistry and the GenoArray HPV genotyping assay and calculated their 
long-term survival rate using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The total P16-positive rate according to immunostaining results was
7.57% (51/674). None of the P16-negative patients were HPV-positive according to 
the HPV genotyping test. The rate of HPV infection among patients with LSCC was
4.9% (33/674). HPV infection was more common among nonsmokers (P<0.05),
nondrinkers (P<0.05), and patients with supraglottic LSCC (P<0.05). Of the 33
HPV-positive patients, 28 (84.8%) were infected with HPV-16, 2 with HPV-18, 1
with HPV-31, 1 with HPV-33 and 1 with HPV-45. The 3-year overall survival rate
and progression-free survival rate were higher in HPV-positive than HPV-negative 
patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (76.3% vs. 70.7%, 
P = 0.30 and 65.1% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.37, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HPV was not a main causal factor in LSCC carcinogenesis in this
Chinese population. HPV infection did not alter patients' overall survival or
progression-free survival rates in this study.
