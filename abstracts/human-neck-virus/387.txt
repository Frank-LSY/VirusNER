We used adeno-associated virus-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-human FasL (AAV-EGFP-hFasL) to deliver FasL into Hep-2 cells, cytotoxicity was detected by MTS assay , apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry. We also treated the xenograft of Hep-2 tumor in nude mice with intratumoral injection of AAV-EGFP-hFasL. The size of the xenograft, the apoptosis in the xenograft, and the survival rate of the inoculated mice were then evaluated.
