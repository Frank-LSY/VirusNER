Head and neck cancer is frequently associated with alcohol and tobacco
consumption but there is an increasing incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma
associated with oncogenic type-16 human papillomavirus (HPV). The clinical
profile of these patients is distinct from that of other patients, with an
earlier onset, 1/1 male to female sex ratio, cystic cervical nodes. Detection of 
intratumoral viral DNA is essential to confirm the role of HPV. According to
several reports, the prognosis in terms of survival and locoregional control is
better in HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma than in HPV-negative oropharyngeal
carcinoma or associated with tobacco consumption. The future lies in vaccination 
of women against cervical cancer but vaccination of boys will be certainly
necessary.
