BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma often occurs in humans in the nasopharyngeal
epithelium area. Ebstein-Barr (EB) virus plays a key role in the process of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma lesions. Early antigen antibody (EA-IgA) and viral
capsid antigen IgA (VCA-IgA) of EB virus detection in serum can effectively
monitor the process of nasopharyngeal carcinoma lesions. Serum vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C and VEGF-D expression detection can reflect
the distant metastases ability of human tumor cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 153 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in our
hospital were enrolled, while 148 cases of healthy adults were selected as
control. ELISA was used to detect serum EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, VEGF-C and -D expression
levels. Spearman rank correlation analysis was applied to test the correlation of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma TNM clinical stage and different indexes.
RESULTS: Serum EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, VEGF-C and -D expression in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma patients was 43.74±2.6 U•mL^-1, 62.5±2.7 U·mL^-1, 473.25±3.4 pg•mL^-1, 
and 498.36±2.3 pg•mL^-1, respectively, which was significantly higher than in the
control group as 18.65±3.7 U•mL^-1, 23.74±1.5 U•mL^-1, 225.42±2.3 pg•mL^-1, and
257.24±3.5 pg•mL^-1 (P<0.05). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma TNM clinical staging was
obviously correlated with serum EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, and VEGF-C (P<0.05), but not
VEGF-D (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient serum EA-IgA and VCA-IgA expression
levels were significantly correlated with TNM staging. The high levels of these 3
indicators suggest advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma TNM staging and serious
lesions.
