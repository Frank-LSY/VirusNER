A recent histopathologic study implicated human tonsillar crypt epithelium as an 
important site for EV71 replication in EV71-caused fatal cases. This study aimed 
to confirm the susceptibility of human tonsillar epithelium to EV71. Two human
tonsillar epithelial cell lines (UT-SCC-60A and UT-SCC-60B) were susceptive to
EV71, and PI3K/AKT, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 signal pathways were activated.
Interferon-α, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12p40 were induced and regulated by
PI3K/AKT, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 signal pathways. PI3K/AKT pathway activation
appeared to suppress the induction of TNF-α, which induced cell survival by
inhibiting GSK-3β. The activation of NF-κB was observed but inhibited by these
pathways in EV71 infection. Furthermore, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were essential for
efficient EV71 replication. Human tonsillar epithelial cells support EV71
replication and display innate antiviral immunity in vitro, indicating that human
tonsillar epithelial cells may be novel targets for EV71 infection and
replication in vivo.
