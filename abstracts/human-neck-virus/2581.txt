Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) was first described in the 1800s, but 
it was not until the 1980s when it was convincingly attributed to human papilloma
virus (HPV). RRP is categorized into juvenile onset and adult onset depending on 
presentation before or after the age of 12 years, respectively. The prevalence of
this disease is likely variable depending on the age of presentation, country and
socioeconomic status of the population being studied, but is generally accepted
to be between 1 and 4 per 100 000. Despite the low prevalence, the economic
burden of RRP is high given the multiple procedures required by patients.
Multiple studies have shown that the most likely route of transmission of HPV in 
RRP is from mother to child during labor. Exceptions to this may include patients
with congenital RRP who have been exposed in utero and adult patients who may
have been exposed during sexual contact. Although cesarean section may prevent
the exposure of children to the HPV virus during childbirth, its effectiveness in
preventing RRP is debatable and the procedure itself carries an increased risk of
complications. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine holds the most promise for the
prevention of RRP by eliminating the maternal reservoir for HPV.
