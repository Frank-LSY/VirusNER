To clarify the synergistic influence of human papillomavirus (HPV) status and
squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) mRNA expression on head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) prognosis, HPV DNA presence and SCCA1 and SCCA2 mRNA
expression were determined by PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR,
respectively, in 121 patients with primary HNSCC who were receiving curative
treatment. HPV DNA was detected in 28.1% (34/121) of HNSCC cases, and only
high-risk types (HPV-16, HPV-33, HPV-35 and HPV-58) were observed. Positive HPV
status showed a significantly better prognosis than negative HPV status (P =
0.022). An elevated SCCA2/SCCA1 mRNA ratio was an independent predictor of
disease recurrence (P = 0.004). In addition, HPV-negative patients with a high
SCCA2/SCCA1 ratio (>0.27) had a significantly lower recurrence-free survival rate
than HPV-negative patients with a low SCCA2/SCCA1 ratio (P < 0.011). Our findings
revealed that both HPV status and the SCCA2/SCCA1 mRNA ratio are independently
associated with prognosis in HNSCC. Patients with both a HPV-negative status and 
a high SCCA2/SCCA1 ratio might need intensified treatment and rigorous follow up 
after treatment because of the high risk of recurrence.
