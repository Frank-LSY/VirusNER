BACKGROUND: The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma caused by
oncogenic HPV (HPV-OPSCC) is rising worldwide. HPV-OPSCC is commonly diagnosed by
RT-qPCR of HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins or by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 
2A, multiple tumor suppressor 1 (p16) immunohistochemistry (IHC). Droplet digital
PCR (ddPCR) has been recently reported as ultra-sensitive and highly precise
method of nucleic acid quantification for biomarker analysis. We aimed to
validate this method for the detection of HPV-16 E6 and E7 in HPV-OPSCC.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from January 2015-November 2015 at initial
presentation to the University of Alberta Head and Neck Oncology Clinic. RNA was 
extracted, purified and quantified from prospectively collected participant
tissues, and ddPCR was performed with fluorescent probes detecting HPV-16 E6 and 
E7. Results from ddPCR were compared with p16 IHC performed by clinical pathology
as standard of care.
RESULTS: Head and neck tissues were prospectively obtained from 68 participants
including 29 patients with OPSCC, 29 patients with non-OPSCC and 10 patients
without carcinoma. 79.2% of patients with OPSCC were p16 positive. The
sensitivity and specificity of ddPCR HPV E6/E7 compared with p16 IHC in OPSCC was
91.3 and 100%, respectively. The amount of target RNA used was ≤1 ng, 20-50 times
lower than reported by other for RT-qPCR HPV E6/E7.
CONCLUSIONS: The ddPCR of HPV E6/E7 is a novel and highly specific method of
detecting HPV-16 in OPSCC. Cancer 2016;122:1544-51. © 2016 American Cancer
