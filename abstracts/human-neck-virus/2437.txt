Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are the only source of human lymphoid 
cells routinely available for immunomonitoring of T-cell responses to microbial
and tumor-associated antigens. However, previous work in mice and humans had
indicated that CD4 T cells transiently lose antigen sensitivity when cellular
contacts are lost (eg, by entering the circulation). Using the simple and robust 
protocol for resetting T cells to original reactivity (RESTORE; ie, preculturing 
PBMCs for 2 days at a high cell density before initiation of antigenic
stimulation), we show that CD8 T-cell responses to viral and tumor-associated
antigens are greatly underestimated in blood, and sometimes even remain
undetected, if conventional, unprocessed PBMC cultures are used. The latter
finding is particularly striking with regard to the appearance of Wilms tumor 1
protein-specific CD8 T-cell responses in leukemia patients after allogeneic bone 
marrow transplantation. The dramatic increase in antigen sensitivity of
"restored" CD8 T cells is associated with phosphorylation of proximal T-cell
receptor signaling components, and with the upregulation of genes involved in
aerobic glycolysis, thereby increasing T-cell functionality. The RESTORE protocol
permits a more meaningful monitoring of CD8 memory T-cell responses to viral
infections and tumors and vaccination success. Furthermore, when generating
T-cell lines for adoptive T-cell therapy, it avoids the loss of those clones,
which strictly depend on the primed status conferred by cellular interactions in 
the tissue context for their initial reactivation by antigen. The data reported
in this article have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(accession number GSE63430).
