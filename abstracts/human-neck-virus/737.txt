BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viral tumor therapy is an emerging field in the fight
against cancer with rising numbers of clinical trials and the first clinically
approved product (Adenovirus for the treatment of Head and Neck Cancer in China) 
in this field. Yet, until recently no general (bio)marker or reporter gene was
described that could be used to evaluate successful tumor colonization and/or
transgene expression in other biological therapies.
METHODS: Here, a bacterial glucuronidase (GusA) encoded by biological
therapeutics (e.g. oncolytic viruses) was used as reporter system.
RESULTS: Using fluorogenic probes that were specifically activated by
glucuronidase we could show 1) preferential activation in tumors, 2) renal
excretion of the activated fluorescent compounds and 3) reproducible detection of
GusA in the serum of oncolytic vaccinia virus treated, tumor bearing mice in
several tumor models. Time course studies revealed that reliable differentiation 
between tumor bearing and healthy mice can be done as early as 9 days post
injection of the virus. Regarding the sensitivity of the newly developed assay
system, we could show that a single infected tumor cell could be reliably
detected in this assay.
CONCLUSION: GusA therefore has the potential to be used as a general marker in
the preclinical and clinical evaluation of (novel) biological therapies as well
as being useful for the detection of rare cells such as circulating tumor cells.
