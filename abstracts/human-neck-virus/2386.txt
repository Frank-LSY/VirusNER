BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present the impact of
clinicopathological factors on patient survival in tonsillar squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) that needs to be evaluated.
METHOD: This study enrolled 86 patients with tonsillar SCC undergoing surgical
resection.
RESULTS: The cumulative 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate for stages I,
II, III, and IVa/b tumors was 100%, 91.7%, 100%, and 61.8%, respectively.
Unfavorable cumulative 5-year DSS rates were significantly correlated with
advanced T classification (p = .029), tumor thickness over 1 cm (p = .007), 3 or 
more positive neck lymph nodes (p < .001), and extracapsular spread (ECS; p =
.002). Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of 3 or more positive
neck lymph nodes (p = .035) and the stage IVa/b (p = .022) were the independent
predictors of the 5-year DSS.
CONCLUSION: Patients with tonsillar SCC with stage IVa/b and metastasis to 3 or
more lymph nodes have poorer clinical outcomes. Novel therapeutic strategies are 
necessary for these patients.
