Nasal type of Natural Killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma manifests in the nasal cavity. 
Approximately 95% of them are associated with EBV(Ebstein Barr Virus) with a
strong predilection for the Asian population. It has certain systemic and
localized symptoms which aid in diagnosis of the condition. However, the
histological criteria is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis as well as aiding in
confirming the association of EBV. Nasal type of NK/T cell lymphoma has a guarded
prognosis. Treatment plan include radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy.
Despite all this, the 5-year survival rate ranges from 15-75%. A 35 years old
male presented with an ulcerative nasal lesion. Diagnosed as nasal type of NK/T
cell lymphoma via a tissue biopsy, it was managed by chemo-radiotherapy leading
to complete resolution of symptoms and disease free on his follow-up 6 months
later.
