BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is
distinctive among head-and-neck cancers in its undifferentiated histopathology
and highly metastatic character. We have recently investigated the involvement of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NPC. In a previous study, we found a
close association of expression of LMP1, the principal EBV oncoprotein, with
expression of Twist and induction of EMT.
METHODS: We analysed expression of Snail in 41 NPC tissues by
immunohistochemistry. The role of Twist as well as Snail in EMT of NPC was
investigated by using NP69SV40T human nasopharyngeal cells.
RESULTS: In NPC tissues, overexpression of Snail is associated with expression of
LMP1 in carcinomatous cells. In addition, expression of Snail positively
correlated with metastasis and independently correlated inversely with expression
of E-cadherin. Expression of Twist had no association with expression of
E-cadherin. Further, in a human nasopharyngeal cell line, LMP1 induces EMT and
its associated cellular motility and invasiveness. Expression of Snail is induced
by LMP1 in these cells, and small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to Snail reversed the
cellular changes. By contrast, Twist did not produce EMT in these nasopharyngeal 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the association of EMT with the metastatic
behaviour of NPC. These results suggest that induction of Snail by the EBV
oncoprotein LMP1 has a pivotal role in EMT in NPC.
