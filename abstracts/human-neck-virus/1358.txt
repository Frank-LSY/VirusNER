BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus DNA detection in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma has been linked to improved patient prognosis. The main aims of the
study was to test the hypotheses that HPV16 E6/E7 oncogene and p53 function
within tumours were associated with the widely reported improved patient survival
and prognosis in head and neck cancer.
METHODS: HPV16 DNA, mRNA and p53 mRNA presence were analysed in a prospective
study of 42 unselected HNSCC patients; correlating the data with patient age,
tumour staging/grade, treatment response, disease recurrence and survival.
RESULTS: HPV16 DNA and HPV16 mRNA were present in 45.2 % and 21.4 % of patients, 
respectively. There was a significant positive association between the detection 
of HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA and p53 mRNA (p = 0.032), but this was not replicated for
HPV16 DNA. Five-year disease free survival for the whole cohort was 63 % (CI
52.5-73.5 %). Multivariable analysis revealed only HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA expression to
have significant prognostic influence (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that HPV16 oncogenic transcriptional activity
within HNSCC tumours is associated with improved patient survival and better
prognosis in a German population. Simple HPV DNA detection alone did not
demonstrate this association. The significant association of full-length
(wild-type) p53 with HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA is further evidence for a functional
relationship, which could contribute to the widely reported improved survival and
prognosis. Larger studies are required to validate the frequency of HPV16 mRNA
expression in HNSCC.
