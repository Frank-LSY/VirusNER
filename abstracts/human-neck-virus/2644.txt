Although the etiology of Graves' disease is still not clear, it is generally
suggested that environmental factors such as infections contribute to the
development of Graves' disease. We report here three cases of Graves' disease
which presented simultaneously with infectious mononucleosis due to primary EBV
infection. Acute EBV infection might play an important role in the onset of
Graves' disease. These three women complained of a sore throat or neck pain,
resembling subacute thyroiditis. In the case of thyrotoxicosis accompanied by
sore throat or neck pain, Graves' disease must be distinguished from subacute
thyroiditis.
