Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is considered a benign disease
although malignant transformation is well-described. The involvement of human
papilloma virus (HPV) in malignant transformation is still being discussed. We
present a case of rapid malignant transformation of RRP in a 29-year-old male.
The tumour as well as biopsies from his previous laryngeal papillomas tested
positive for HPV 16. Introduction of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine with a view to
preventing cervical cancer may also reduce RRP, and subsequently possibly also
the incidence of head-and-neck cancers.
