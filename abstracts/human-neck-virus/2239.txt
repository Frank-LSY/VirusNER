PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of primary gross tumor volume (pGTV) and nodal
gross tumor volume (nGTV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and
the difference in their role between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and
HPV-negative patients.
METHODS: The patient cohort consists of 91 OPSCC patients treated with definitive
radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). 
All patients had a minimum follow-up of 31 months. Volume measurements were made 
from computer tomography (CT) scans and HPV status was assessed by p16
immunohistochemistry. The end points were as follows: overall survival (OS),
disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional control (LRC).
RESULTS: pGTV was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall
survival (OS; p = 0.020) in p16-negative patients. nGTV of p16-negative tumors
had significant prognostic value in all end points in multivariate analyses.
High-stage (III-IVc) p16-negative tumors were only associated with significantly 
poorer OS (p = 0.046) but not with poorer LRC or DFS when compared with the
low-stage (I-II) tumors. nGTV of p16-positive tumors was an independent
prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.005) and LRC (p = 0.007) in multivariate
analyses.
CONCLUSION: pGTV may serve as an independent prognostic factor in p16-negative
patients and nGTV may serve as an independent prognostic factor both in
p16-positive and p16-negative patients treated with radiochemotherapy or
radiotherapy using IMRT. Tumor volume may have an impact on selecting patients
for de-escalation protocols in the future, both in p16-positive and p16-negative 
patients.
