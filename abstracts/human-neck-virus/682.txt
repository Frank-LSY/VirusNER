In August 2012, a wildlife biologist became ill immediately following a 6-wk
field trip to collect bats and rodents in South Sudan and Uganda. After returning
to the US, the biologist was admitted to the hospital with multiple symptoms
including fever, malaise, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, stiffness
in the neck, and sore throat. Soon after admission, the patient developed a
maculopapular rash and oropharynx ulcerations. The patient remained hospitalized 
for 14 d. Several suspect pathogens, including viral hemorrhagic fever viruses
such as Ebola viruses and Marburg viruses, were ruled out through standard
diagnostic testing. However, deep sequencing and metagenomic analyses identified 
a novel paramyxovirus, later named Sosuga virus, in the patient's blood. To
determine the potential source, bat tissues collected during the 3-wk period just
prior to the onset of symptoms were tested for Sosuga virus, and several Egyptian
rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were found to be positive. Further analysis
of archived Egyptian rousette tissues collected at other localities in Uganda
found additional Sosuga virus-positive bats, suggesting this species could be a
potential natural reservoir for this novel paramyxovirus.
