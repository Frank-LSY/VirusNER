AIMS: To determine prognostic factors for locoregional relapse (LRR), distant
relapse and all-cause death in a contemporary cohort of locoregionally advanced
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) treated with definitive
chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: OSCC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy between
2005 and 2010 were identified from a prospective head and neck database. Patient 
age, gender, smoking history, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, T- and
N-category, lowest involved nodal level and gross tumour volume of the primary
(GTV-p) and nodal (GTV-n) disease were analysed in relation to LRR, distant
relapse and death by way of univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 130 patients were identified, 88 HPV positive, with a median
follow-up of 42 months. On multivariate analysis HPV status was a significant
predictor of LRR (hazard ratio 0.15; 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.51) and death
(hazard ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.59) but not distant relapse
(hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.22-1.27). Increasing T-category was
associated with a higher risk of LRR (hazard ratio 1.80 for T3/4 versus T1/2; 95%
confidence interval 1.08-2.99), death (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval
1.06-1.77) and distant relapse (hazard ratio 1.35; 95% confidence interval
1.00-1.83). Increasing GTV-p was associated with increased risk of distant
relapse and death. N3 disease and low neck nodes were significant for LRR,
distant relapse and death on univariate analysis only.
CONCLUSION: Tumour HPV status was the strongest predictor of LRR and death.
T-category is more predictive of distant relapse and may provide additional
prognostic value for LRR and death when accounting for HPV status.
