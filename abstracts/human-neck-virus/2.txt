Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are detected in 70-80% of oropharyngeal cancers in
the developed world, the incidence of which has reached epidemic proportions. The
current paradigm regarding the status of the viral genome in these cancers is
that there are three situations: one where the viral genome remains episomal, one
where the viral genome integrates into the host genome and a third where there is
a mixture of both integrated and episomal HPV genomes. Our recent work suggests
that this third category has been mischaracterized as having integrated HPV
genomes; evidence indicates that this category consists of virus-human hybrid
episomes. Most of these hybrid episomes are consistent with being maintained by
replication from HPV origin. We discuss our evidence to support this new
paradigm, how such genomes can arise, and more importantly the implications for
the clinical management of HPV positive head and neck cancers following accurate 
determination of the viral genome status.
