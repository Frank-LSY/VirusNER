The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from an unknown
primary cancer (CUP) remains a matter of controversy. Although new advanced
diagnostic tools, such as positron emission tomography, have recently been
introduced in oncology, the frequency of this tumour entity in clinical practice 
means it is still relevant. Recently introduced molecular profiling platforms may
provide biological classification for the primary tissue of origin as well as
insights into the pathophysiology of this clinical entity, including the
characterisation of the Epstein-Barr virus and human papilloma virus genomas in
the metastatic cervical nodes. Due to the lack of randomised trials, a standard
therapy has not been identified yet. Although neck dissection followed by
post-operative radiotherapy is the most generally accepted approach, there are
other curative options that can be used in some patients: neck dissection alone, 
nodal excision followed by post-operative radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. A
major controversy remains in the target radiation volumes that range from
ipsilateral neck irradiation to prophylactic irradiation of all potential mucosal
sites and both sides of the neck. Finally, the administration of concurrent
chemotherapy is currently being advised for patients with adverse prognostic
factors.
