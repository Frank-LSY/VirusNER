Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with OPSCC. A prognostic risk model was proposed, based on our large, unselected cohort of patients with HPV status, comorbidity and nodal stage being the important prognostic factors. In addition, this study emphasizes the importance of performing an HPV DNA-specific test besides p16-immunostaining.
