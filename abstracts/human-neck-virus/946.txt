We describe a 51-year-old white man with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) of the
head, neck, trunk, and upper extremities of more than 20 years' duration who
developed rapidly progressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the bilateral ear 
helices. Human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected from excised specimens from the 
ears via tissue immunohistochemistry. Human papillomavirus infection of discoid
lesions may be responsible for the rapid progression of SCC of this patient's
bilateral ear helices.
