Therapies that boost the anti-tumor responses of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
have shown promise; however, clinical responses to the immunotherapeutic agents
currently available vary considerably, and the molecular basis of this is
unclear. We performed transcriptomic profiling of tumor-infiltrating CTLs from
treatment-naive patients with lung cancer to define the molecular features
associated with the robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed
considerable heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with
activation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and of immunological-checkpoint
molecules such as 4-1BB, PD-1 and TIM-3. Tumors with a high density of CTLs
showed enrichment for transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM
cells), such as CD103, and CTLs from CD103hi tumors displayed features of
enhanced cytotoxicity. A greater density of TRM cells in tumors was predictive of
a better survival outcome in lung cancer, and this effect was independent of that
conferred by CTL density. Here we define the 'molecular fingerprint' of
tumor-infiltrating CTLs and identify potentially new targets for immunotherapy.
