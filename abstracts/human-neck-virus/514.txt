BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) associated Head and Neck Cancers (HNCs)
have generated significant amount of research interest in recent times. Due to
high incidence of HNCs and lack of sufficient data on high-risk HPV (hr-HPV)
infection from North -East region of India, this study was conceived to
investigate hr-HPV infection, its types and its association with life style
habits such as tobacco, alcohol consumption etc.
METHODS: A total of one hundred and six primary HNC tumor biopsy specimens were
collected. These samples were analyzed for hr-HPV DNA (13 HPV types) using hybrid
capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyping was done by E6 nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR).
RESULTS: The presence of hr-HPV was confirmed in 31.13% (n = 33) and 24.52% (n = 
26) of the HNC patients by nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR) and HC2 assay
respectively. Among hr-HPV positive cases, out of thirteen hr- HPV types
analyzed, only two prevalent genotypes, HPV-16 (81.81%) followed by HPV-18
(18.18%) were found. Significant association was observed between hr-HPV
infection with alcohol consumption (p <0.001) and tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) in
HNC cases. Compared to HPV-18 infection the HPV-16 was found to be significantly 
associated with tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) habit.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that tobacco chewing and alcohol consumption 
may act as risk factors for hr-HPV infection in HNCs from the North-East region
of India. This was the first study from North-East India which also assessed the 
clinical applicability of HC2 assay in HNC patient specimens. We suggest that
alcohol, tobacco and hr- HPV infection act synergistically or complement each
other in the process of HNC development and progression in the present study
population.
