OBJECTIVE: Microbiologic causes of facial palsy in children were investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Forty-six children aged 0 to 16 years with peripheral facial palsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Paired serum samples and cerebrospinal fluid were tested to find
indications of microbes associated with facial palsy. The microbes tested were
herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus-6,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, influenza A and B virus, picorna,
cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie B5
virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, Chlamydia psittaci, and Toxoplasma gondii.
Besides the routine tests in clinical practice, serum and cerebrospinal fluid
samples were tested with a highly sensitive microarray assay for DNA of herpes
simplex virus 1 and 2; human herpes virus 6A, 6B, and 7; Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus.
RESULTS: Incidence for facial palsy was 8.6/100,000/children/year. Cause was
highly plausible in 67% and probable in an additional 11% of cases. Borrelia
burgdorferi caused facial palsy in 14 patients (30%), varicella zoster virus in 5
(11%) (one with concomitant adenovirus), influenza A in 3 (6%), herpes simplex
virus 1 in 2 (4%) (one with concomitant enterovirus), otitis media in 2 (4%), and
human herpesvirus 6 in 2 (4%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae, neurofibromatosis, and
neonatal age facial palsy affected 1 child (2%) each.
CONCLUSION: Microbiologic etiology association of pediatric facial palsy could
frequently be confirmed. Borreliosis was the single most common cause; hence,
cerebrospinal fluid sampling is recommended for all pediatric cases in endemic
areas. Varicella zoster virus accounted for 11% of the cases, being the second
most common factor.
