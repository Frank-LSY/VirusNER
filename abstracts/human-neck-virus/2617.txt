ALDH1A1 positive cells are a unique component of the tonsillar crypt niche and
are lost along with NGFR positive stem cells during tumourigenesis.

Interest into the cellular biology of human tonsillar crypts has grown in recent 
years because it is now known to be the site of origin of most human papilloma
virus (HPV) induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). Despite the
interest, still relatively little is known regarding the cellular hierarchy and
dynamics of this anatomical subsite. Here we evaluate normal tonsillar crypts for
expression of putative stem cell markers. We found that ALDH1A1 was uniquely
expressed in a subset of suprabasal tonsillar crypt epithelium. This cell
population was unique from NGFR expressing cells, which were previously
identified to have stem/progenitor activity in vitro. In vivo mitochondrial
lineage tracing was consistent with a basal to luminal progression of cellular
development. This provides support for NGFR cells as the resident stem/progenitor
cells in tonsillar crypts, and suggests that the ALDH1A1 cells are not
stem/progenitor cells, but merely a unique component of the crypt cellular
microenvironment. Analysis of tumours found that both NGFR and ALDH1A1 are lost
in HPV+ and HPV- tumours, while LGR5 expression is induced in the same tumours.
These results identify a unique component of the tonsillar crypt
epithelium-ALDH1A1 cells-and support a cellular model where NGFR+ cells are the
long-lived progenitor cells within tonsillar crypts. They also provide evidence
that NGFR and ALDH1A1+ cells are lost during tumourigenesis.
