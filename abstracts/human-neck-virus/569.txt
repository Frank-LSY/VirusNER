We recently reported that a trimeric neck and carbohydrate recognition domain
(NCRD) fragment of human surfactant protein D (SP-D), a host defense lectin, with
combinatorial substitutions at the 325 and 343 positions (D325A+R343V) exhibits
markedly increased antiviral activity for seasonal strains of influenza A virus
(IAV). The NCRD binds to glycan-rich viral envelope proteins including
hemagglutinin (HA). We now show that replacement of D325 with serine to create
D325S+R343V provided equal or increased neutralizing activity compared with
D325A+R343V. The activity of the double mutants was significantly greater than
that of either single mutant (D325A/S or R343V). D325A+R343V and D325S+R343V also
strongly inhibited HA activity, and markedly aggregated, the 1968 pandemic H3N2
strain, Aichi68. D325S+R343V significantly reduced viral loads and mortality of
mice infected with Aichi68, whereas wild-type SP-D NCRD did not. The pandemic
H1N1 strains of 1918 and 2009 have only one N-linked glycan side on the head
region of the HA and are fully resistant to inhibition by native SP-D.
Importantly, we now show that D325A+R343V and D325S+R343V inhibited Cal09 H1N1
and related strains, and reduced uptake of Cal09 by epithelial cells. Inhibition 
of Cal09 was mediated by the lectin activity of the NCRDs. All known human
pandemic strains have at least one glycan attachment on the top or side of the HA
head, and our results indicate that they may be susceptible to inhibition by
modified host defense lectins.
