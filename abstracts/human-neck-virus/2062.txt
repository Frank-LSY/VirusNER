Hereditary deafness is one of the most common disabilities affecting newborns.
Many forms of hereditary deafness are caused by morphological defects of the
stereocilia bundles on the apical surfaces of inner ear hair cells, which are
responsible for sound detection. We explored the effectiveness of gene therapy in
restoring the hair cell stereocilia architecture in the whirlin mouse model of
human deafness, which is deaf due to dysmorphic, short stereocilia. Wild-type
whirlin cDNA was delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV8) by injection through
the round window of the cochleas in neonatal whirler mice. Subsequently, whirlin 
expression was detected in infected hair cells (IHCs), and normal stereocilia
length and bundle architecture were restored. Whirlin gene therapy also increased
inner hair cell survival in the treated ears compared to the contralateral
nontreated ears. These results indicate that a form of inherited deafness due to 
structural defects in cochlear hair cells is amenable to restoration through gene
therapy.
