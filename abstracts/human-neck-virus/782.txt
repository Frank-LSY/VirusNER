BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is
preferentially associated with some head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs), with variable infection rates reported.
METHODS: We assessed HPV involvement in HNSCC using the Roche Linear Array HPV
Genotyping Test, which can detect 37 different HPV types. We examined the
prevalence of HPV infection in 92 HNSCCs (oropharynx, oral cavity, and other
HNSCC sites).
RESULTS: HPV was frequently detected in oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) (16/22,
73%), but was uncommon in oral cavity cancers (2/53, 4%), and in other HNSCC
subsites (1/17, 6%). HPV positive tumors were associated with patients that were 
40-60 years old (p = 0.02), and node positive (p = < 0.0001). HPV 16 was the most
prevalent type, but other types detected included 6, 18, 33, 35, 45, and 52/58.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that in contrast to oropharyngeal cancers, oral
cancers and other HNSCCs infrequently harbor HPV.
