PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the current status of molecular markers in the
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck.
RECENT FINDINGS: A variety of studies have been undertaken to improve
classification of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In the past several
years, it has become apparent that human papillomavirus is an important cause of 
oropharyngeal carcinoma, and likely represents a distinct mechanism of
carcinogenesis compared to tobacco and alcohol-associated tumors. Human
papillomavirus-associated tumors seem to have an improved prognosis, and may
respond differently to treatment. Other markers such as epidermal growth factor
receptor, p53, p16, and others have been extensively studied. Several of these
proteins have been the targets of investigational drugs, and epidermal growth
factor receptor inhibitors are becoming an important weapon in our therapeutic
arsenal.
SUMMARY: Molecular markers have given us new understanding of the pathogenesis of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, these markers are not yet ready
to be used in the routine clinical management of patients with these tumors, and 
further research is needed.
