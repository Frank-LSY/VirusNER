Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly occurs on the inner leaflet 
of the host cell plasma membrane, incorporating the essential viral envelope
glycoprotein (Env) within a budding lattice of HIV-1 Gag structural proteins. The
mechanism by which Env incorporates into viral particles remains poorly
understood. To determine the mechanism of recruitment of Env to assembly sites,
we interrogate the subviral angular distribution of Env on cell-associated virus 
using multicolor, three-dimensional (3D) superresolution microscopy. We
demonstrate that, in a manner dependent on cell type and on the long cytoplasmic 
tail of Env, the distribution of Env is biased toward the necks of
cell-associated particles. We postulate that this neck-biased distribution is
regulated by vesicular retention and steric complementarity of Env during
independent Gag lattice formation.
