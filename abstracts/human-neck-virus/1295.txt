BACKGROUND: Factors predicting locoregional relapse after surgery for
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were identified in the pre-human
papillomavirus (HPV) era. We examined whether traditional indications for
adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) still correlate
with locoregional relapse in HPV-positive patients after transoral robotic
surgery (TORS).
METHODS: Retrospective review of oropharyngeal SCC cases identified patients with
HPV-positive tumors who did not receive adjuvant therapy after TORS despite
intermediate or high-risk features.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 26.7 months (range, 4.9-73.1 months). Five of 25
eligible patients (20%) relapsed at a median 4.8 months (range, 3.2-7.8 months). 
Two of 18 (11%) intermediate and 3 of 7 (43%) high-risk patients relapsed.
Kaplan-Meier 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival estimates for intermediate
and high-risk patients were 88% and 57% (p = .078), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Traditional indications for adjuvant RT or CRT were associated with
high risk of locoregional relapse in HPV-positive patients treated with TORS
alone. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1674-E1679, 2016.
