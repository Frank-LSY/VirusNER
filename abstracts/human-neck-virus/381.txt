Authors present a case report of a 2-year-old boy with recurrent laryngeal
papillomatosis with oesophageal involvement due to human papilloma virus types 6 
and 11, who needed surgical treatment every 4-6 weeks, altogether 11 times. After
detailed immunological evaluation of basic immunological parameters, and in vitro
detection of good responses to routine childhood immunization, a therapeutic
vaccination has been decided with a 4-valent HPV vaccine. Following the third
vaccine dose both laryngeal and oesophageal lesions disappeared completely, and
for 2 years follow-up no papillomas could be detected. Vaccination could be a
promising method in the treatment of RRP in children.
