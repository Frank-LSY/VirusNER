61-years-old male patient presented with complain of neck swelling and soreness
following contrast-enhanced (CE) CT examination with resolution of symptoms in
36-48 hours. He is diagnosed with hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC); already treated with radiofrequency ablation for HCC. He had already
undergone two CECT examinations before he was referred to our institution for
disease staging/treatment. He also underwent three triphasic CT scan examinations
at our institution during the course of treatment for treatment response and
staging. Patient remained undiagnosed up to his fourth CT scan due to inability
to relate symptoms with contrast administration. The patient was offered close
monitoring on fifth CT exam and ultrasound of neck revealed enlarged and
echogenic bilateral submandibular glands, however, thyroid and bilateral parotid 
glands appear unremarkable. This represents transient iodinated contrast induced 
sialadenitis with sparing of parotid glands.
