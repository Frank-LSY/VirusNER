Head and neck cancer (HNC) includes a diverse range of malignancies arising
commonly from mucosal epithelia of the upper aerodigestive tract. Head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the most common form of HNC, develops in the
oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx and is associated with tobacco exposure, alcohol
abuse, and infection with oncogenic viruses. Despite global advances in cancer
care, HNSCC often presents with advanced disease and is associated with poor
5-year survival of ~50%. Genotyping tumor tissue to guide clinical
decision-making is becoming commonplace in modern oncology, but in the management
of HNSCC, tissue biopsies with cytopathology or histopathology remain the
mainstay for diagnosis. Furthermore, conventional biopsies are temporally and
spatially limited, often providing a brief snapshot of a single region of a
heterogeneous tumor. In the absence of a useful biomarker, both primary and
recurrent HNSCCs are diagnosed with conventional imaging and clinical
examination. As a result, many patients are diagnosed with advanced disease.
Tumor DNA is an emerging biomarker in HNSCC. DNA fragments are constantly being
shed from tumors and metastatic lesions, and can therefore be detected in blood
and other bodily fluids. Utilizing next-generation sequencing techniques, these
tumor DNA can be characterized and quantified. This can serve as a minimally
invasive liquid biopsy allowing for specific tumor profiling, dynamic tumor
burden monitoring, and active surveillance for disease recurrences. In HNSCC,
analysis of tumor DNA has the potential to enhance tumor profiling, aid in
determining patient prognosis, and guide treatment decisions.
