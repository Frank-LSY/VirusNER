BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) has improved clinical outcomes compared to HPV-negative disease. 
However, the biology underlying differences in prognosis remains unclear.
METHODS: We characterized the expression of DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit 
(DNA-PkCS ), a key DNA repair protein also associated with tumor progression, in 
29 cases of oropharyngeal SCCs and correlated our findings with HPV status and
disease recurrence. In addition, we assessed therapeutic response, migration, and
invasion in head and neck cancer cell lines upon DNA-PkCS knockdown.
RESULTS: DNA-PkCS expression was significantly decreased in HPV-positive compared
to HPV-negative oropharyngeal SCC samples. Within the HPV-positive subgroup,
DNA-PkCS expression was inversely related to HPV E6 and E7 expression and trended
toward significance as a predictor of recurrence. DNA-PkCS knockdown in cell
lines resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and radiotherapy and reduced
cell migration and invasion.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest DNA-PkCS should be further studied as a
potential marker of tumor progression in HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs. © 2016
