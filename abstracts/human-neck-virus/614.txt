The most common initial presentation was an asymptomatic nodal mass for HPV(+) patients (n = 208; 69% vs. 29%, P < .001) in contrast to dysphagia/odynophagia for HPV(-) (n = 96; 34% vs. 63%, P < .001). Protracted interval (>12 months) from onset of signs/symptoms to diagnosis was observed in 18 (9%) HPV(+) versus three (3%) HPV(-) patients (P = .058). More HPV(+) patients required repeated (â‰¥2) biopsy procedures (56% vs. 10%, P < .001). Misattribution to other disease occurred in eight (4%) HPV(+) patients (seven were mistaken as having a "branchial cleft cyst" when there were cystic lymph nodes and one as having a "lymphoma") compared to none in HPV(-) .
