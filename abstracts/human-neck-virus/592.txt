A higher level (p=0.011) of the total cfDNA was found in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (9.60 ± 6.23 ng/ml) in comparison with other HNSCC (7.67 ± 4.44 ng/ml). The level of cfDNA in patients with clinical N2-N3 disease (9.28 ± 6.34 ng/ml) was (p=0.015) higher than in patients with a clinical N0-N1 disease (7.50 ± 3.69 ng/ml). It was also higher in patients with stage IV (9.16 ± 6.04 ng/ml) compared with stages I-III of cancer (7.26 ± 3.63 ng/ml) (p=0.011). Analysis of HPV16/18 in plasma revealed that 14% of patients were HPV-positive, the majority of whom had the type HPV16 (96.4%). CfDNA level was comparable in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC patients, as well in the OPSCC subgroup. Somatic mutations in EGFR and KRAS were not found.
