Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth common malignant
tumors of whole body with a high incidence, which accounts for 90% of the head
and neck malignant tumors. Previous studies have shown the risk factors, such as 
tobacco and alcohol, are related to the occurrence and development of HNSCC.
However, recent studies have shown that the non-tobacco and non-alcohol related
HNSCC increased year by year. At the same time, more and more studies have shown 
that HNSCC is related to the infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), and the 
occurrence and development of HPV-positive HNSCC has own characteristics in
epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis. In this paper the research
progress for HPV-positive HNSCC is reviewed.

头颈鳞状细胞癌(鳞癌)发病率较高，在全身恶性肿瘤中位居第6位，占头颈部恶性肿瘤的90%。过去一般认为烟草、酒精等危险因素与头颈鳞癌发生、发展有关，但新近研究表明，
非烟酒相关的头颈鳞癌逐年增加。同时，越来越多的研究表明，头颈鳞癌与人乳头状瘤病毒(HPV)感染相关，其发生、发展具有自身独特的流行病学及临床特点。本文就HPV阳性
的头颈鳞癌相关研究作一综述。.
