Persistent infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [as indicated by chronic
HBV surface antigenemia (HBsAg)] continues to be an important problem in
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and specifically in those receiving
maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Patients on HD who are HBsAg-positive for a year
have little chance of ever eliminating the virus; hence, clearance of HBsAg is a 
rare event in long-term HD patients. We report the case of a 62-year-old diabetic
woman who was HBsAg-positive at the time she started HD and remained so until
10 years later when she became HBsAg-negative followed by the development of
hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). Prior to her seroconversion, she
suffered a persistent infection of her HD arteriovenous graft (AVG) that required
prolonged antibiotics and several surgical procedures. We speculate that this
immune stimulation contributed to her seroconversion.
