Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) remain a serious world health problem due to their 
association with cervical and head and neck cancers. While over 100 HPV types
have been identified, only a few subtypes are associated with malignancies. HPV
16 and 18 are the most prevalent oncogenic types in head and neck cancers.
Although it has been proven that some subsets of benign and malignant head and
neck lesions are associated with HPV, the general population have very little
awareness and knowledge of their association with HPV. Therefore, the purpose of 
this study was to determine the knowledge of HPV and its links with head and neck
benign and malignant lesions in a group of Pakistani dental patients who attended
the Dental Department of the Sandeman provincial hospital in Quetta, Pakistan.
One hundred and ninety-two patients were recruited and requested to answer a
questionnaire. It was revealed that there was a low level of knowledge about HPV 
and its association with head and neck benign and malignant lesions among the
participants. This result suggested that more education regarding the
relationship of HPV in inducing head and neck benign and malignant lesions is
required in this group of patients.
