PURPOSE: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated head and neck
cancers (HNCs) have been increasing in Peru. However, the burden of oral HPV
infection in Peru has not been assessed. The objective of this cross-sectional
study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of oral HPV infection in a
population-based sample from males and females from Lima, Peru.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2011, a population-based sample of 1099
individuals between the ages of 10 and 85 from a low-income neighbourhood in
Lima, Peru was identified through random household sampling. Information on
demographic, sexual behaviours, reproductive factors and oral hygiene were
collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Oral rinse specimens
were collected from each participant, and these specimens were genotyped using
the Roche Linear Array assay. ORs were used to assess differences in the
prevalence of any oral HPV and any high-risk oral HPV infection by demographic
factors, sexual practices and oral hygiene among individuals 15+ years of age.
RESULTS: The prevalence of any HPV and any high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was 6.8% and
2.0%, respectively. The three most common types were HPV 55 (3.4%), HPV 6 (1.5%) 
and HPV 16 (1.1%). Male sex (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.03) was associated with 
any HPV infection after adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of oral HPV in this study was similar to estimates
observed in the USA. Higher prevalence of oral infections in males was consistent
with a male predominance of HPV-associated HNCs and may signal a sex-specific
aetiology in the natural history of infection.
