Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the tenth most commonly
diagnosed form of cancer in males worldwide. Although the incidence of HNSCC is
relatively low in the United States, the affected population is changing from
older males to young Caucasian males. High-risk strains of the human
papillomavirus (HPV) already are associated with cervical, oral, and anal
cancers; however, HPV DNA has been detected in about a third of head and neck
malignancies. Nurses play major roles in educating the public and treating
patients with HPV and HNSCC. Many possibilities for outreach and research exist
that could decrease HPV and HNSCC rates.
