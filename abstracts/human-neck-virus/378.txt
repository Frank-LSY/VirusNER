In head and neck cancer management, immunoexpression of protein p16 is widely used as a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity due to challenges of direct HPV testing. Previously p16 has been reported to have good sensitivity but only moderate specificity in HPV-status determination. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing information on sensitivity and specificity of p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HPV-status determination among the recent studies.
