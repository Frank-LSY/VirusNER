Approximately 20% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The effect of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on HPV oncogene expression of HNSCC cells remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer activity and possible molecular pathways of ATO on the six HNSCC cell lines (three HPV-positive and three HPV-negative).
