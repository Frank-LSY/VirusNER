Approximately 20% of the tumours in humans are associated with contagious viral
agents. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and highly aggressive tumour which may
originate from the epidermal stratum basale, although the origin is still
controversial. This tumour is most commonly found in elderly and
immunocompromised patients in sun exposed areas, especially in the head and neck 
regions. Merkel cell carcinoma often causes a diagnostic challenge with a
dramatically increasing incidence. In 2008, a DNA tumour virus, a polyomavirus
(Merkel cell polyomavirus) was detected in Merkel cell carcinomas, and this
finding helped to understand the etiological background of the disease. The
infectious - probably viral - etiology resulted in a paradigm shift in
pathogenesis and, hopefully, in therapy as well. This review summarizes the
current knowledge related to Merkel cell carcinoma and the first oncogenic human 
polyomavirus, the Merkel cell polyomavirus, to promote the clinical adaptation of
the information.
