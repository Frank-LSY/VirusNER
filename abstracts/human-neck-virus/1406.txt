BACKGROUND/AIMS: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an etiological risk factor for a
subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. HPV has been proven to be a
powerful prognostic biomarker for oropharyngeal cancer, but its role in the
larynx has not been explored in depth. Here, we sought to evaluate the prevalence
and genotype distribution of HPV in patients with laryngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (LSCC) in northeast China.
METHODS: HPV DNA in specimens from 211 patients diagnosed with LSCC was analyzed 
by the polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, and p16
overexpression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. p16 expression was scored
positive if strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was present in > 
75% of tumor cells.
RESULTS: In this study, infection with HPV and p16 expression were not absolutely
consistent. Among all patients, 132 (62.6%) were positive for HPV DNA (HPV+),
while 23 (10.9%) were inconsistent for HPV and p16. Multivariate analysis
indicated that HPV, but not p16, is an independent prognostic factor for overall 
survival in LSCC. Overall survival was significantly improved in HPV+ LSCC
patients compared with the HPV-negative group (hazard ratio, 0.395; 95%
confidence interval, 0.185-0.843; p = 0.016). Among the 132 HPV+ patients, 28
(21.2%) were HPV-16 single infection.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that HPV DNA is a more reliable surrogate marker
than p16 for the prediction of survival in patients with LSCC.
