We report 2 cases of adolescents who developed follicular mucinosis following
cutaneous infections. A 17-year-old adolescent boy was evaluated for a 2-week
history of erythematous papules and plaques on his face and neck. One month prior
to presentation a culture was taken that was positive for methicillin-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus-associated impetigo. Biopsies from 2 representative lesions
demonstrated follicular mucinosis without evidence of folliculotropism or T cell 
gene rearrangements. A separate case involved a 17-year-old adolescent girl who
presented with an edematous plaque on her right preauricular region and scattered
erythematous papules and small annular plaques over her face 2 weeks following a 
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HHV-2) infection. on her face. Biopsy showed
follicular mucinosis without evidence of epidermotropism or lymphocyte atypia.
There was no herpesvirus cytopathic effect. The first case rapidly responded to
an oral prednisone taper and the second case resolved over several weeks without 
further treatment.
