Genetic engineering of tumor cells to express immune-stimulatory molecules,
including cytokines and co-stimulatory ligands, is a promising approach to
generate highly efficient cancer vaccines. The co-signaling molecule, LIGHT, is
particularly well suited for use in vaccine development as it delivers a potent
co-stimulatory signal through the Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) receptor on 
T cells and facilitates tumor-specific T cell immunity. However, because LIGHT
binds two additional receptors, lymphotoxin β receptor and Decoy receptor 3,
there are significant concerns that tumor-associated LIGHT results in both
unexpected adverse events and interference with the ability of the vaccine to
enhance antitumor immunity. In order to overcome these problems, we generated
tumor cells expressing the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of anti-HVEM
agonistic mAb on the cell surface. Tumor cells expressing anti-HVEM scFv induce a
potent proliferation and cytokine production of co-cultured T cells. Inoculation 
of anti-HVEM scFv-expressing tumor results in a spontaneous tumor regression in
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dependent fashion, associated with the induction of
tumor-specific long-term memory. Stimulation of HVEM and 4-1BB co-stimulatory
signals by anti-HVEM scFv-expressing tumor vaccine combined with anti-4-1BB mAb
shows synergistic effects which achieve regression of pre-established tumor and T
cell memory specific to parental tumor. Taken in concert, our data suggest that
genetic engineering of tumor cells to selectively potentiate the HVEM signaling
pathway is a promising antitumor vaccine therapy.
