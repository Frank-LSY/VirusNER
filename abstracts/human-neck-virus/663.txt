This study enrolled five H&N-KD specimens from three patients treated between 1995 and 2005 at Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, Paris, France. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. HHV-8 DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, whilst EBV sequences were identified by PCR and in situ hybridisation.
