PURPOSE: Human cell lines are useful for studying cancer biology and
preclinically modeling cancer therapy, but can be misidentified and
cross-contamination is unfortunately common. The purpose of this study was to
develop a panel of validated head and neck cell lines representing the spectrum
of tissue sites and histologies that could be used for studying the molecular,
genetic, and phenotypic diversity of head and neck cancer.
METHODS: A panel of 122 clinically and phenotypically diverse head and neck cell 
lines from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, oral leukoplakia, immortalized
primary keratinocytes, and normal epithelium was assembled from the collections
of several individuals and institutions. Authenticity was verified by carrying
out short tandem repeat analysis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status and cell
morphology were also determined.
RESULTS: Eighty-five of the 122 cell lines had unique genetic profiles. HPV-16
DNA was detected in 2 cell lines. These 85 cell lines included cell lines from
the major head and neck primary tumor sites, and close examination shows a wide
range of in vitro phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: This panel of 85 genomically validated head and neck cell lines
represents a valuable resource for the head and neck cancer research community
that can help advance understanding of the disease by providing a standard
reference for cell lines that can be used for biological as well as preclinical
studies.
