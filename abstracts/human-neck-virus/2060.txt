There has been a sharp increase in the incidence of the human papilloma
virus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, partly due to the
increasingly widespread awareness and recognition of this entity. This review
assimilates the recent histopathologic classifications, staging systems, rapidly 
expanding research base and developments in management of human papilloma
virus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and summarizes their
implications for routine diagnostic practice. Differential diagnoses and their
cytologic appearances are detailed and the utility of p16 staining and other
immunohistochemistry testing is discussed.
