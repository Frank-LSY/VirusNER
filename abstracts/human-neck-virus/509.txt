Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of a distinct subset of oropharyngeal
cancer rising in incidence in the United States and other developed countries.
This increased incidence, combined with the strong effect of tumor HPV status on 
survival, has had a profound effect on the head and neck cancer discipline. The
multidisciplinary field of head and neck cancer is in the midst of re-evaluating 
evidence-based algorithms for clinical decision making, developed from clinical
trials conducted in an era when HPV-negative cancer predominated. This article
reviews relationships between tumor HPV status and gender, cancer incidence
trends, overall survival, treatment response, racial disparities, tumor staging, 
risk stratification, survival post disease progression, and clinical trial
design.
