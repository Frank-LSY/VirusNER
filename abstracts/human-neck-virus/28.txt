BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer is generally
associated with excellent response to therapy, but some HPV-positive tumors
progress despite aggressive therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
viral oncogene expression and viral integration sites in HPV16- and
HPV18-positive squamous cell carcinoma lines.
METHODS: E6/E7 alternate transcripts were assessed by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of integrated
papillomavirus sequences (DIPS-PCR) and sequencing identified viral insertion
sites and affected host genes. Cellular gene expression was assessed across viral
integration sites.
RESULTS: All HPV-positive cell lines expressed alternate HPVE6/E7 splicing
indicative of active viral oncogenesis. HPV integration occurred within
cancer-related genes TP63, DCC, JAK1, TERT, ATR, ETV6, PGR, PTPRN2, and TMEM237
in 8 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lines but UM-SCC-105 and
UM-GCC-1 had only intergenic integration.
CONCLUSION: HPV integration into cancer-related genes occurred in 7 of 9
HPV-positive cell lines and of these 6 were from tumors that progressed. HPV
integration into cancer-related genes may be a secondary carcinogenic driver in
HPV-driven tumors. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 840-852, 2017.
