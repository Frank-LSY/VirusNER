OBJECTIVE: A comprehensive questionnaire designed to assess the full spectrum of 
potential human papillomavirus (HPV)-related psychosocial effects in women does
not exist. The HPV Impact Profile (HIP) was developed to determine the
psychosocial impact of HPV infection and related interventions.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Draft instrument items and domains were developed
using a literature review and cognitive debriefing interviews with women who had 
experienced HPV-related conditions. An importance rating questionnaire guided
item ranking and reduction. A draft questionnaire was pilot-tested for
comprehension and ease of completion. Psychometric evaluation of the final HIP
was conducted in a survey of 583 women. Data quality, item acceptability, scale
acceptability, reliability, and discriminate construct validity were assessed.
OUTCOME MEASURE: The final HIP contained 29 items rated on a 0-10 point
discretized visual analog scales grouped into seven hypothesized domains.
RESULTS: Total HIP scores ranged from 0 (no impact) to 100 (worst impact). Data
quality was high, with missing data for items ranging from 0 to 0.7% and over 99%
of the scores were computable. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.64 to 0.90 and was 
> or =0.7 for 5/7 domains. Discriminant construct validity was demonstrated.
Appropriate modifications could potentially be made to improve some aspects of
the HIP, including modification to include other HPV diseases such as head and
neck, anal, and vulvovaginal cancers and HPV disease in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease-specific HIP has favorable reliability and construct
validity and a good ability to discriminate among disease severity.
