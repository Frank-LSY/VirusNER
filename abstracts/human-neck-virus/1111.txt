Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) have better responses to radiotherapy and higher overall
survival rates than do patients with HPV-negative HNSCC, but the mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon are unknown. p16 is used as a surrogate marker for HPV
infection. Our goal was to examine the role of p16 in HPV-related favorable
treatment outcomes and to investigate the mechanisms by which p16 may regulate
radiosensitivity. HNSCC cells and xenografts (HPV/p16-positive and -negative)
were used. p16-overexpressing and small hairpin RNA-knockdown cells were
generated, and the effect of p16 on radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic
cell survival and tumor growth delay assays. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were
assessed by immunofluorescence analysis of 53BP1 foci; DSB levels were determined
by neutral comet assay; western blotting was used to evaluate protein changes;
changes in protein half-life were tested with a cycloheximide assay; gene
expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction; and data from The
Cancer Genome Atlas HNSCC project were analyzed. p16 overexpression led to
downregulation of TRIP12, which in turn led to increased RNF168 levels, repressed
DNA damage repair (DDR), increased 53BP1 foci and enhanced radioresponsiveness.
Inhibition of TRIP12 expression further led to radiosensitization, and
overexpression of TRIP12 was associated with poor survival in patients with
HPV-positive HNSCC. These findings reveal that p16 participates in
radiosensitization through influencing DDR and support the rationale of blocking 
TRIP12 to improve radiotherapy outcomes.
