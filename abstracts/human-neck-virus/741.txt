At 144 h, cell viability was significantly lowered by irradiation only in uninfected cells. Infection combined with irradiation resulted in increased expression of E6, E7, BCL2 and NF-ÎºB1 at 144 h. Simultaneously, E6 and E7 were down-regulated in non-irradiated infected cells. Irradiation and infection with 0.00001 MOI separately up-regulated caspase 3 but infection with 0.0001 MOI halved its expression in irradiated cells.
