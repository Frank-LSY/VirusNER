An adenovirus harboring the HSV thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene under the
regulation of a trans-splicing ribozyme that targets telomerase is cytotoxic to
cancer cells because it inhibits DNA replication (Ad5mTR). Furthermore, it
induces anti-tumor immunity by activating cytotoxic T cells. Because multiple
chemotherapeutic agents also activate cytotoxic T-cell immunity during the direct
killing process of tumor cells, we herein explored whether low-dose cisplatin
could synergize with cytotoxic Ad5mTR to potentiate its therapeutic effect by
boosting anti-tumor immunity in a murine HPV16-associated tonsillar carcinoma
model. Tumor regression was enhanced when low-dose (1 mg/kg) cisplatin was added 
to suicide gene therapy using Ad5mTR. Meanwhile, 1 mg/kg cisplatin alone had no
tumor-suppressive effects and did not result in any systemic toxicity. Thus,
cisplatin along with Ad5mTR improved tumor clearance by increasing the number of 
E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Specifically, analysis of the tumors and lymph nodes
supported improved immune clearance by increasing the number of E7-specific CD8+ 
T cells inside tumors (40%, P < 0.05) as a result of the combination of suicide
gene and cisplatin therapy. These results suggest that a low dose of cisplatin
potentiates CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, and its addition to the
HSVtk-based adenovirus results in additional therapeutic benefits for
HPV16-positive head and neck cancer patients.
