HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 66-year-old man with acute fever, myalgia,
arthralgia, restricted movement and neck stiffness was admitted to our emergency 
unit. Three weeks earlier treatment with adalimumab, a tumor necrosis
factor(TNF)-alpha antagonist was started by the patient's dermatologist because
of a psoriasis vulgaris with associated psoriasis arthritis. All previous
laboratory tests where without pathological findings.
INVESTIGATIONS: The imaging procedures showed no pathological findings.
Transaminase and CRP levels were markedly elevated. Hepatitis serology revealed
reactivation of a chronic hepatitis B infection, while a combined viral and toxic
hepatitis was detected by liver biopsy.
TREATMENT AND COURSE: On the day of admittance acute neurological symptoms
developed including muscular cramps and dyskinesia. Hypotonia and tachyarrhythmia
were treated with parenteral infusions and digitoxin. Reactivation of a chronic
hepatitis B infection with subfulminant liver failure was diagnosed, caused by
immunosuppressive therapy with adalimumab. The patient was transferred to be
treated with the antiviral drug entecavir.
CONCLUSION: The exclusion of acute and/or chronic hepatitis before using
TNF-alpha antagonists is recommended but in daily routine often ignored. The
presented case demonstrates the risk of reactivating a chronic hepatitis B during
therapy with a TNF-alpha antagonist.
