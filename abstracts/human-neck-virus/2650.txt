Many tonsillar tumors present clinically as cervical nodal metastases and the
primary tumor is often difficult to find. HPV-driven tonsillar carcinoma begins
in the reticulated crypt epithelium, possibly through viral integration. The
basement membrane is not complete in the reticulated crypt epithelium, which may 
enhance the immune function. We examined the reticulated crypt epithelium in a
normal case and five neoplastic tonsils with cervical metastasis as the
presenting symptom to further investigate whether tonsil carcinoma in-situ
exists. Our results suggest that in-situ carcinoma may need to be excluded from
the future staging for human papilloma virus associated tonsillar tumors.
