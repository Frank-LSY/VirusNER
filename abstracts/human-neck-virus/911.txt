BACKGROUND: The recent epidemic of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) has not addressed its association
with lymphoid tissue in the oropharynx or the potential role of Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV)/HPV coinfection.
METHODS: The prevalence of HPV and EBV infection/coinfection and CD21 mRNA
expression were determined in normal and cancerous tissues from the oropharynx
using in situ hybridization (ISH), p16, and quantitative reverse transcriptase
PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of coinfection on tumorigenicity were evaluated using 
proliferation and invasion assays.
RESULTS: Normal oropharynx, tonsil, non-cancer base of tongue (BOT), and BOT from
sleep apnea patients demonstrated EBV positivity ranging from 7% to 36% depending
on the site and methods of detection used (qRT-PCR or ISH). Among non-malignant
BOT samples, HPV positivity was noted only in 20%. The percent of tonsil and BOT 
cancers positive for HPV (up to 63% and 80%, respectively) or coinfected with
HPV/EBV (up to 25% and 70%, respectively) were both significantly associated with
cancer status. Notably, HPV/EBV coinfection was observed only in malignant tissue
originating in lymphoid-rich oropharynx sites (tonsil, BOT). CD21 mRNA (the major
EBV attachment receptor) was detected in tonsil and BOT epithelium, but not in
soft-palate epithelium. Coinfected cell lines showed a significant increase in
invasiveness (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of HPV/EBV infection and coinfection in
BOT and tonsil cancers, possibly reflecting their origins in lymphoid-rich
tissue. In vitro, cells modeling coinfection have an increased invasive
potential.
