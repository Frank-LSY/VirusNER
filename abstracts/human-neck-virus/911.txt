Human herpesvirus 8-positive (HHV-8⁺) and Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV⁺) germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder (GLD) is extremely rare and occurs most commonly in immunocompetent persons who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative. It is also recognized as a favorable response to conventional chemotherapy. Here, we report a case of a 75-year-old man with an incidentally found mass in the neck, compatible with GLD, which was detected by positron emission tomography (PET). Computed tomography (CT) scan, PET, and bone marrow studies showed only the left neck mass and no evidence of metastasis. Excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. The patient received four courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) therapy. After these treatments, he remained disease-free for 19 months. To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of HHV-8⁺, EBV⁺ GLD have been documented. This is the first such case report in Asia.
