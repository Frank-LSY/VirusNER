BACKGROUND: High-risk Human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-associated head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a distinct epidemiologic and pathologic
disease. The data of HR-HPV testing on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) materials of 
cervical lymph nodes in patients with metastatic HNSCC are limited.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed metastatic HNSCC cases with cervical lymph
node FNAs which were tested for p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HR-HPV DNA in 
situ hybridization (ISH).
RESULTS: Of the 87 cases studied, the overall adequacy rate of cell block
material was 86% for HR-HPV ISH, 93% for p16 IHC, 84% for both and 95% for either
one. Pathologist-performed FNAs showed significantly higher percentage of
satisfactory specimens for p16 and HR-HPV tests than clinician-performed FNAs. Of
the 73 cases adequate for both p16 IHC and HR-HPV ISH, the concordant rate
between p16 and HR-HPV results was 78%. P16 positivity had sensitivity of 90% and
specificity of 75% to predict primary oropharyngeal HNSCC, while HR-HPV test
showed a similar high sensitivity (91%) but a better specificity (94%).
CONCLUSION: FNAs of cervical lymph nodes yield adequate materials for reliable
HR-HPV testing in metastatic HNSCCs and should be incorporated into routine
pathologic evaluation for these patients. The high concordance between p16 IHC
and HR-HPV ISH suggests p16 IHC may serve as a surrogate for HR-HPV ISH in
metastatic HNSCC cases with oropharyngeal origin and is helpful to pinpoint
primary tumor site. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:792-798. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,
