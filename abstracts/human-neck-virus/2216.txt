PURPOSE: Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whose disease
is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection have a
significantly better outcome than those with HPV-negative disease, but the
reasons for the better outcome are not known. We postulated that they might
relate to an ability of HPV proteins to confer a better response to radiotherapy,
a commonly used treatment for OSCC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We stably expressed the specific splicing-derived
isoforms, E6∗I and E6∗II, or the entire E6 open reading frame (E6total), which
gives rise to both full length and E6∗I isoforms, in OSCC cell lines. Radiation
resistance was measured in clonogenicity assays, p53 activity was measured using 
transfected reporter genes, and flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle and
apoptosis.
RESULTS: E6∗I and E6total sensitized the OSCC cells to irradiation, E6∗I giving
the greatest degree of radiosensitization (approximately eightfold lower
surviving cell fraction at 10 Gy), whereas E6∗II had no effect. In contrast to
radiosensitivity, E6∗I was a weaker inhibitor than E6total of tumor suppressor
p53 transactivator activity in the same cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed
that irradiated E6∗I expressing cells had a much higher G2M:G1 ratio than control
cells, indicating that, after G2, cells were diverted from the cell cycle to
programmed cell death.
CONCLUSION: This study supports a role for E6∗I in the enhanced responsiveness of
HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas to p53-independent radiation-induced death.
