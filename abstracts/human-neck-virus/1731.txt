BACKGROUND: Inflammatory pseudotumours of the head and neck are rare. A
connection has been made between inflammatory pseudotumours and human
immunodeficiency virus positivity.
CASE REPORT: This paper reports a case of an inflammatory pseudotumour presenting
with a lesion in the left tonsil and left cervical lymph node in a 49-year-old
human immunodeficiency virus positive patient. A histological diagnosis was
obtained after biopsy and serial radiological imaging.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostic uncertainties can lead to unnecessary surgery. It is
important to recognise the clinical, radiological and histological indicators of 
an inflammatory pseudotumour to enable a timely diagnosis and arrange appropriate
treatment. In patients with co-morbidities causing immunocompromise, the
potential diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumour should be considered. This is
especially the case in human immunodeficiency virus patients, as inflammatory
pseudotumours have been associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome, which can manifest up to several years after the initiation of, or
change in, antiretroviral therapies.
