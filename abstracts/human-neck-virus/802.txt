Radioresistance is one of the main determinants of treatment outcome in oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and treatment of radioresistant OSCC is difficult
due to cross resistance to other conventional treatments. We aimed to identify
whether genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus expressing relaxin (RLX), which
affects collagen metabolism, can effectively inhibit growth of the radioresistant
OSCC. Therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenovirus was compared between
radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo, and
spread of adenovirus throughout the tumor mass was verified by
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Oncolytic adenovirus effectively killed cancer cells 
and there was no significant difference in the cytotoxic effect between
radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC cell lines. In animal experiments, the
adenovirus significantly reduced the size of tumor, and there was no significant 
difference between radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC. In IHC, RLX expressing
adenovirus showed better proliferation and eliminated collagens more effectively 
compared to RLX nonexpressing adenovirus. These findings suggested that
genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus can effectively inhibit growth of the
radioresistant OSCC and might be a new therapeutic option in radioresistant OSCC.
