The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare disease caused by an infection of the
geniculate ganglion by the varicella-zoster virus. The main clinical features of 
the syndrome are as follows: Bell palsy unilateral or bilateral, vesicular
eruptions on the ears, ear pain, dizziness, preauricular swelling, tingling,
tearing, loss of taste sensation, and nystagmus. We describe a 23-year-old white 
woman, who presented with facial paralysis on the left side of the face, pain,
fever, ear pain, and swelling in the neck and auricular region on the left side. 
She received appropriate treatment with acyclovir, vitamin B complex, and CMP
nucleus. After 30 days after presentation, the patient did not show any signs or 
symptoms of the syndrome. At follow-up at 1 year, she showed no relapse of the
syndrome.
