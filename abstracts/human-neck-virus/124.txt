OBJECTIVES: Because torque teno virus (TTV) has been implicated in tumorigenesis 
as a cocarcinogen, we studied TTV prevalence in saliva and biopsy samples from
head and neck cancer (HNCC) patients, patients with premalignant lesions of oral 
cancer, and controls. We also wished to determine the TTV genotypes in HNCC
patients.
METHODS: A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the N22 region
of the TTV genome, as well as direct sequencing of PCR fragments, was used.
RESULTS: TTV prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27/71, 38%; tumor
biopsy: 22/74, 30%) than in controls (saliva: 8/56, 14%; oral mucosa: 1/19, 5%). 
TTV prevalence was also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral
carcinoma (saliva: 9/18, 50%; biopsy: 5/21, 24%). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV
belonging mostly to genotypes 1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the 
cases, identical TTV strains were present in the biopsy and salivary sample of
the same HNCC patient. In addition, the same TTV strain was detected in 2
laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 independent patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are compatible with the idea that TTV might act as a
cocarcinogen in certain cases of HNCC. Alternatively, HNCC may facilitate either 
TTV replication or TTV entry into the saliva.
