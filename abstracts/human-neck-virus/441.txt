In 2012, a female wildlife biologist experienced fever, malaise, headache,
generalized myalgia and arthralgia, neck stiffness, and a sore throat shortly
after returning to the United States from a 6-week field expedition to South
Sudan and Uganda. She was hospitalized, after which a maculopapular rash
developed and became confluent. When the patient was discharged from the hospital
on day 14, arthralgia and myalgia had improved, oropharynx ulcerations had
healed, the rash had resolved without desquamation, and blood counts and hepatic 
enzyme levels were returning to reference levels. After several known suspect
pathogens were ruled out as the cause of her illness, deep sequencing and
metagenomics analysis revealed a novel paramyxovirus related to rubula-like
viruses isolated from fruit bats.
