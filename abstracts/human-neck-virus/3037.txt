BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported to have a 
negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in Asian populations. Whether such 
an association exists in Western populations is less clear.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of data from NHANES III, a United States
national health survey conducted from 1988 to 1994, included 6089 participants
aged 40-75 years, selected after excluding people with hepatitis virus serology, 
elevated alcohol consumption, decreased renal function, or steroid use, and
pregnant females. The main outcome, BMD at the femoral neck, was measured using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The primary exposure, NAFLD, was defined as
moderate or severe hepatic steatosis diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography.
RESULT: After controlling for gender and menopausal status, race/ethnicity, age
and body mass index, NAFLD was not significantly associated with BMD (beta
coefficient: -0.006, 95%CI: -0.016, 0.003). A secondary analysis categorized
participants with NAFLD according to their serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
levels into high and normal ALT NAFLD groups, and compared these with the
non-NAFLD group. NAFLD with higher levels of ALT was associated with lower levels
of BMD (beta coefficient: -0.023, 95% CI: -0.044, -0.002).
CONCLUSION: This study showed a relationship between NAFLD with high ALT and
lower BMD in the general U.S. population.
