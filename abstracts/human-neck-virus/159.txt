BACKGROUND: The last decade has seen changes in the epidemiology of mucosal
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCCs), with increasing numbers
of cases attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. We sought to
determine the prevalence of HPV and p16(INK4a) expression in Australian HNSCC
patients and to identify predictors of HPV-positivity.
METHODS: We recruited 248 HNSCC patients with histologically confirmed primary
SCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx diagnosed between 2004 
and 2010. All patients completed a questionnaire. Clinical data were abstracted
from medical records. HPV presence in paraffin-embedded tumours was determined by
PCR, and expression of p16(INK4a), p21(WAF1), p53, pRB, cyclin D1, and Ki67 by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Fifty (20%) patients were HPV-positive, 63 (28%) overexpressed
p16(INK4a), and 44 (19%) were positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) (high concordance
between HPV-positivity and p16(INK4a) status, κ=0.72). HPV-16 was most common
(84%), followed by HPV-18 (10%), HPV-33 (4%) and HPV-69 (2%). HPV and p16(INK4a) 
prevalence was highest for SCCs of the oropharynx, followed by hypopharynx,
larynx and oral cavity (HPV and p16(INK4a)p<0.0001). HPV prevalence and
p16(INK4a)-overexpression were significantly higher in younger than older
patients (HPV p=0.001; p16 (INK4a)p=0.003). Heavy smokers had lower HPV
prevalence than non- or moderate smokers (p=0.017). Gender and alcohol
consumption were not associated with HPV or p16(INK4a) status. HPV-positive
tumours had significantly lower cyclin D1 and higher p21(WAF1) expression than
HPV-negative tumours.
CONCLUSION: HPV prevalence and p16(INK4a)-overexpression were highest in
oropharyngeal tumours, younger patients, and non-smokers.
