BACKGROUND: Extracapsular spread (ECS) in cervical lymph node metastases from
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is regarded as an adverse prognostic 
factor and is often used to select patients who may benefit from adjuvant
therapy. The prognostic value of ECS was evaluated for patients with
oropharyngeal SCC (OPC; with known p16/human papillomavirus [HPV] status) and for
patients with SCC of the oral cavity (OCC).
METHODS: Disease-specific survival (DSS) was assessed among SCC patients with
cervical lymph node metastases (n = 347, including 133 patients with OPC and 214 
patients with OCC). All patients were treated surgically between 1983 and 2009.
ECS status was determined by pathologists at the time of initial pathologic
evaluation and confirmed for this study. HPV status of patients with OPC was
determined via immunohistochemistry for p16 and in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: Among OCC patients, ECS was a significant, independent factor
influencing DSS. For OCC patients with ECS, 3-year DSS was 45% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 36%-56%); for those without ECS, 3-year DSS was 71% (95% CI,
62%-81%; P = .0018). The effect of ECS was independent of the number of positive 
lymph nodes as well as other clinical, pathologic, and treatment variables. Of
the 133 OPC patients, 76 (57%) were p16-positive and 57 (43%) were p16-negative. 
ECS status did not correlate with DSS among p16-positive or p16-negative OPC
patients.
CONCLUSION: ECS was not associated with worse DSS in p16-positive or p16-negative
OPC patients. Adverse prognostic value of ECS in OCC patients was confirmed.
