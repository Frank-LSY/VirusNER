The aim of this study was to analyze protein and gene expression of HER2 in 224
head and neck precancerous and malignant lesions by immunohistochemistry and FISH
analysis. In parallel, expression of pStat3, Sox2, IFI16 and p16, Ki67 was
evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis was assessed on formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens. A combined method for HPV detection
consisting of p16 immunostaining and two PCR probes was applied. HER2 gene status
was evaluated by FISH analysis. HPV DNA was detected in 24% of cases with
predominant HPV16 genotype. HPV-positive lesions had higher HER2, pStat3 and
within carcinoma group, and higher IFI16 expression compared to the HPV-negative 
group (Fig. 1A-B-C). A strong positive correlation between Sox2 and proliferative
activity was observed, whereas IFI16 expression displayed a negative relationship
with Sox2 and Ki67 activity. The most striking result was higher pStat3
expression in HPV-positive lesions and its strong positive correlation with IFI16
expression. The presence of HPV may induce upregulation of HER2/neu, pStat3 and
IFI16. High levels and a strong positive correlation between pStat3 and IFI16
suggest their synergistic pro-apoptotic effects in HPV-positive lesions.
