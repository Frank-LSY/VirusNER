MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are able to function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes in tumorigenesis, and have been proposed as novel targets for anticancer
treatment. It has previously been suggested that miRNAs have important roles in
the initiation and progression of glioblastoma; however, the effects of miR‑566
in glioblastoma are currently unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate
that miR-566 can modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by targeting 
Von Hippel‑Lindau (VHL) in glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the
expression of miR-566. Glioblastoma is a highly vascularized tumor, which
exhibits increased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF, which are
crucial in the process of glioblastoma angiogenesis. Existing research has
demonstrated that VHL is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with various 
tumors. In addition, VHL is able to regulate the expression of VEGF by promoting 
the degradation of hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α via ubiquitination. It has been
predicted, using bioinformatics, that the VHL gene is regulated by miR‑566.
Therefore, the present study hypothesized that miR‑566 may regulate VEGF
expression by targeting VHL during the angiogenic process of glioblastoma
multiforme. The results of the present study demonstrated that inhibition of
miR‑566 expression increases the expression levels of VHL, decreases the
expression levels of VEGF, and inhibits the invasive and migratory abilities of
glioblastoma. In addition, VHL was identified as a functional target of miR‑566.
