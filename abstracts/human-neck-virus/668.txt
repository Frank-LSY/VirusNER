OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a separate HNSCC subgroup with
distinct epidemiology, histopathological characteristics, therapeutic response to
chemotherapy and radiation, and clinical outcome. This study aimed to investigate
the role of HPV infection in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the
correlation between HPV infection, tumor suppressor protein p16 expression, and
clinicopathological features in Japanese patients.
METHODS: In total, 174 OSCC specimens were examined for p16 levels by
immunohistochemistry, and p16-positive OSCCs were analyzed for HPV DNA by in situ
hybridization (ISH) and HPV genotypes by real-time PCR. The results were
evaluated for the association with clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC
patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-four OSCC samples were found positive for p16 expression; all of 
them were well-differentiated tumors. P16 immunoreactivity was significantly
associated with the invasion depth and tended to correlate with sex, site in the 
oral cavity, stromal reaction, TNM stage, and survival. HPV DNA was detected in
13 of 24 (54%) p16-positive OSCC by real-time PCR; HPV 16, 18, and other
high-risk genotypes were the most prevalent. However, ISH failed to detect HPV
DNA in p16-positive OSCCs.
CONCLUSION: P16 immunoreactivity and HPV genotyping by real-time PCR may be
useful markers of HPV infection in OSCC. However, although HPV-related OSCC
showed good outcomes, HPV infection may have a minor role in oral oncogenesis in 
Japanese patients.
