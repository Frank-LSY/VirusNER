Forty-seven OpSCC (24%) were HPVGP PCR-positive; 42 cases were HPV16+, 1 HPV18+, 3 HPV33+ and 1 HPV35+. Brightfield in situ hybridisation did not identify additional HPV-positive cases. Human papilloma virus-associated tumour proportion increased from 13% (1997-2004) to 30% (2005-2012). Human papilloma virus-positivity was an independent predictor for longer disease-specific survival (HR=0.22; 95%CI:0.10-0.47). Only one OSCC was HPV+.
