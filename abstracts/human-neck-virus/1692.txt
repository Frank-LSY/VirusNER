BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC comprise distinct
tumor entities with different biological characteristics. Specific regimens for
the comparably well curable HPV-positive entity that reduce side effects without 
compromising outcome have yet to be established. Therefore, we tested here
whether the inhibition of EGFR or PARP may be used to specifically enhance the
radiosensitivity of HPV-positive HNSCC cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed with five HPV/p16-positive
HNSCC cell lines. Inhibitors used were cetuximab, olaparib and PF-00477736. The
respective inhibition of EGFR, PARP and Chk1 was evaluated by Western blot,
immunofluorescence analysis and assessment of cell cycle distribution. Cell
survival was assessed by colony formation assay.
RESULTS: Inhibition of EGFR by cetuximab failed to radiosensitize any of the
HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines tested. In contrast, PARP-inhibition resulted in a 
substantial radiosensitization of all strains, with the sensitization being
further enhanced by the additional inhibition of Chk1.
CONCLUSIONS: PARP-inhibition effectively radiosensitizes HPV-positive HNSCC cells
and may therefore represent a viable alternative to chemotherapy possibly even
allowing for a reduction in radiation dose. For the latter, PARP-inhibition may
be combined with the inhibition of Chk1. In contrast, the inhibition of EGFR
cannot be expected to radiosensitize HPV-positive HNSCC through the modulation of
cellular radiosensitivity.
