OBJECTIVE: Opportunistic infections may affect the oral mucosa of patients
undergoing radio/chemotherapy through exacerbation of oral mucositis. The aim of 
this study is to evaluate the oral shedding of all eight human herpesviruses and 
its possible association with oral mucositis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed oral rinse
samples, collected weekly, from 20 patients during radiotherapy treatment.
Serologic status to HSV1 and HSV2, EBV, CMV, and VZV in three different periods
was performed by ELISA assay. PCR and enzymatic digestion was performed to detect
HSV1, HSV2, EBV, CMV, VZV, HHV6, HHV7, and HHV8. Oral mucositis was evaluated
according to the WHO criteria.
RESULTS: Oral shedding of EBV, HHV6, and HHV7 was observed in all weeks of
radiotherapy. Considering the episodes of shedding, the highest frequency was
found in patients with EBV excretion (55.0%). No virus reactivation was observed 
by serological analysis. EBV oral shedding frequency was significantly higher
than that of other viruses and showing a positive correlation with oral mucositis
grade ≥2.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive correlation between EBV oral shedding and oral 
mucositis grade ≥2, particularly after 3 weeks of radiotherapy, a period in which
the severity of mucositis was statistically higher. These findings allow us to
infer that the local inflammatory environment in mucositis grade ≥2 is more
favorable for EBV replication.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mucositis is a frequent and important side effect of
radio/chemotherapy treatment. Understanding the possible participation of viruses
in the mechanism of this condition is important to develop strategies for
treatment and prevention.
