BACKGROUND: To date, no treatment modality has been identified as more effective 
for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), and no predictive factors are known to guide
treatment decision for this disease. This retrospective study evaluates the
differential effects of diverse treatment options for OPC according to patient
risk profiles.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We considered two series of locally advanced squamous cell 
OPC patients treated with either surgery followed by radiotherapy (surgical
series) or chemoradiation (CRT) with/without induction docetaxel, cisplatin and
5-fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy (CRT series). Smoking habits, tumor p16
expression/human papillomavirus (HPV) status and T and N stage were analyzed to
stratify the patients according to Ang's risk profile (low, intermediate and high
risk). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were calculated with the
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Globally, 171 patients were considered, 56 in surgical and 115 in CRT
series. Patients were stratified in low- (20% of surgical and CRT groups),
intermediate- (23% and 41%) and high-risk (57% and 39%) groups. In the surgical
series, 5-year OS was 54.5%, 46.9% and 40.0% in low, intermediate and high Ang's 
risk profiles, respectively, whereas in the CRT series those were 100%, 78.9% and
46.7%, respectively. In the multivariable analyses, adjusting for inhomogeneity
between the treatment group, the CRT effect was significantly higher in the low- 
and intermediate-risk groups (P-value for the interaction treatment risk group = 
0.034 in the OS analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, low- and intermediate-risk OPC
patients had a better survival when treated with CRT compared with open surgery
followed by radiation therapy. These data suggest that different treatment
approaches might be essential in determining outcome results.
