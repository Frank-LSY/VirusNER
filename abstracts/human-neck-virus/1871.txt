Mitochondria encoded Cytochrome B (CYTB) gene mutations were reported in tumors
of different anatomic origin but the functional significance of these mutations
are not well studied. Earlier, we found a 7-amino acid deletion mutation in the
CYTB gene in a primary bladder cancer patient. In the present study, we
overexpressed this 7-amino acid deletion mutation of CYTB gene in SV-40
transformed human uroepithelial HUC-1 cells. The nuclear transcribed
mitochondrial CYTB (mtCYTB) was targeted into the mitochondria and generated
increased copies of mitochondria and mitochondrial COX-I protein in the
transfected HUC-1 cells. The proapoptotic protein Bax largely remained confined
to the cytoplasm of the mtCYTB transfected HUC-1 cells without release of
Cytochrome C. The downstream apoptotic proteins PARP also remained uncleaved
along with increased Lamin B1 in the mtCYTB transfected cells. Our results
demonstrate that forced overexpression of mtCYTB in transformed human
uroepithelial HUC-1 cells triggered mitochondrial proliferation and induction of 
an antiapoptotic signaling cascade favoring sustained cellular growth. Coding
mitochondrial DNA mutations appear to have significant functional contribution in
tumor progression.
