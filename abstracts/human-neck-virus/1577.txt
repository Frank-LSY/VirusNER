INTRODUCTION: Many economic evaluations of HPV vaccination have been published,
but most have focused on the prevention of cervical disease as a primary health
outcome. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination is likely to be underestimated if 
not all HPV-associated diseases are taken into account. In this review, we assess
the influence of non-cervical HPV-associated diseases on the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preadolescent HPV vaccination. Areas covered: 
We systematically searched the literature and identified 18 studies that included
non-cervical diseases in the estimates of cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination. 
When taking other HPV-related diseases into account compared to not including
such other diseases, the mean ICERs were 2.85 times more favorable for girls only
vaccination and 3.89 times for gender neutral vaccination. Expert commentary:
Including non-cervical diseases in economic evaluations of HPV vaccination
programs makes it more likely that the ICER falls beneath accepted
cost-effectiveness thresholds and therefore increases the scope for gender
neutral vaccination.
