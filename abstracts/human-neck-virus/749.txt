PURPOSE: Characterize and monitor treatment response in human papillomavirus
(HPV) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using intra-treatment
(intra-TX) imaging metrics derived from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four (30 HPV positive [+] and 4 HPV negative [-])
HNSCC patients underwent a total of 136 MRI including multi-b value DW-MRI
(pretreatment [pre-TX] and intra-TX weeks 1, 2, and 3) at 3.0 Tesla. All patients
were treated with chemo-radiation therapy. Monoexponential (yielding apparent
diffusion coefficient [ADC]) and bi-exponential (yielding perfusion fraction [f],
diffusion [D], and pseudo-diffusion [D*] coefficients) fits were performed on a
region of interest and voxel-by-voxel basis, on metastatic neck nodes. Response
was assessed using RECISTv1.1. The relative percentage change in D, f, and D*
between the pre- and intra-TX weeks were used for hierarchical clustering. A
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to assess the difference in metrics within
and between the complete response (CR) and non-CR groups.
RESULTS: The delta (Δ) change in volume (V)1wk-0wk for the CR group differed
significantly (P = 0.016) from the non-CR group, while not for V2wk-0wk and
V3wk-0wk (P > 0.05). The mean increase in ΔD3wk-0wk for the CR group was
significantly higher (P = 0.017) than the non-CR group. ADC and D showed an
increasing trend at each intra-TX week when compared with pre-TX in CR group
(P < 0.003). Hierarchical clustering demonstrated the existence of clusters in
HPV + patients.
CONCLUSION: After appropriate validation in a larger population, these IVIM
imaging metrics may be useful for individualized treatment in HNSCC patients.
