AIMS: Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) form a 
special niche supporting tumour progression, and both correlate with worse
survival in head and neck cancers. However, the prognostic role of TAM and Tregs 
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still unknown. Therefore, we determined
differences in TAMs and Tregs in different NPC subtypes, and their prognostic
significance.
METHODS: Tissue of 91 NPCs was assessed for TAMs and Tregs by determination of
CD68, CD163, CD206 and FOXP3 expression in the tumour microenvironment.
Clinicopathological correlations were assessed using Pearson X2 test, Fisher's
exact test, analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U test. Survival was analysed
using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression.
RESULTS: CD68 and FOXP3 counts were higher in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive
NPC, while CD68-/FOXP3-, CD163+/FOXP3- and CD206+/FOXP3- infiltrates were more
common in EBV-negative NPC. In the whole NPC group, CD68-/FOXP3- correlated with 
worse overall survival (OS), and after multivariate analysis high FOXP3 count
showed better OS (HR 0.352, 95% CI 0.128 to 0.968). No difference in M2 counts
existed between EBV-positive and negative NPC.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXP3, a Treg marker, seems to be an independent prognostic factor
for better OS in the whole NPC group. Therefore, immune-based therapies targeting
Tregs should be carefully evaluated. M2 spectrum macrophages are probably more
prominent in EBV-negative NPC with also functional differences compared with
EBV-positive NPC.
