INTRODUCTION: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for about 6%
of all malignant cancers. In the epidemiology of oral cavity neoplasm, important 
risk factors include: tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, bad oral hygiene, papilloma
virus infection, riboflavin and iron deficiency.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the investigation was a synthesis of Cu(II) complex
and the evaluation of antioxidative enzymatic barrier in red blood cells of
patients with head and neck tumor as well as in the control group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the investigation conduction, a consent of Bioethics
Committee number RNN/142/09/KB was obtained. Blood for the examination was
obtained from the patients of the Dapartment of Head and Neck Neoplasms Surgery
Medical University of Łódź. The experiment was conducted on the group of 40
patients with HNSCC and 40 healthy people, using spectrophotometric method,
glutathione peroxidase was marked.
RESULTS: The investigation was conducted on the hemolysate obtained from the
patients that were divided into two groups - a study group (1 and 2), which
consisted of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer and a control group (1 
and 2) - healthy people. A significant statistical result for GPX occurred in
control-1 and study-1 group with complex compound Cu(II) (p&lt;0,001).
CONCLUSIONS: Presented research prove, that complex compound
Cis-dichlorobis(N1-hydroxymethyl-3methylpyrazole-κN2)copper (II) has an impact on
the activity of the antioxidative GPX enzyme.
