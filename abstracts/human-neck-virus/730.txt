Recent studies show that the human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) may be
involved in causing cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the impact 
of MCPyV on the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In 
total, 50 paraffin-embedded HNSCC biopsy samples and 50 adjacent non-cancerous
samples were evaluated for the presence of MCPyV DNA and RNA. Among patients, the
five most frequent histopathologic sites were the tongue (22.0%), lip (16.0%),
submandibular (14.0%), cheek (14.0%), and throat (14.0%). MCPyV DNA was positive 
in eight (16.0%) samples. The median MCPyV LT-Ag copy number in the eight
positive samples and in one non-cancerous sample was 4.8 × 10-3 and 2.6 × 10-5
 copies/cell, respectively. Quantification of MCPyV LT-Ag revealed increased
expression in stage III (5.6 × 10-3  copies/cell) than in the other stages. The
MCPyV DNA load in different stages of HNSCC was also statistically significant
(P = 0.027). The viral load was low, suggesting that only a fraction of cancerous
cells is infected. This result provides evidence confirming the presence of MCPyV
in a subset of Iranian patients with HNSCCs, but further studies needed to
confirm our findings.
