OBJECTIVE: To summarize the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC).
DATA SOURCES: Articles in the English language referenced in MEDLINE/PubMed from 
the year 2000 onward.
REVIEW METHODS: Relevant articles pertaining to the epidemiology of HPV-related
OSCC were selected for review, with a particular preference for articles from
2008 onward.
RESULTS: The incidence of HPV-related OSCC continues to increase in North America
and Western Europe, with up to 70% of new oropharyngeal cancer cases being
attributed to HPV, whereas data from the developing world remain lacking. There
is evidence to support distinct risk factors for HPV-related OSCC as compared
with HPV-unrelated OSCC. The long-term natural history of HPV infections remains 
unknown. HPV-related OSCC are associated with an improved prognosis both at the
time of primary diagnosis and disease progression. There is preliminary evidence 
to show that HPV vaccination initiatives are effective in preventing HPV cervical
infections, although data related to oral HPV infections are lacking.
CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of HPV-related OSCC is evolving. Further efforts are
needed to characterize the natural history of oral HPV infection and its
relationship with the eventual development of HPV-associated OSCC to develop
effective tools for secondary prevention.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.
