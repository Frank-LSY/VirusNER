Mucosal high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause a subset of head and
neck cancers (HNC). The HPV-attributable fraction of HNC varies substantially
between countries. Although HNC has a very high incidence in the Indian
subcontinent, information on the contribution of HPV infection is limited. Here, 
we evaluated the HPV-attributable fraction in HNC (N = 364) collected in a
central region of India. HNC from three different anatomical subsites were
included, namely, oral cavity (n = 252), oropharynx (n = 53) and
hypopharynx/larynx (n = 59). In this retrospective study, HPV-driven HNC were
defined by presence of both viral DNA and RNA. Overexpression of p16INK4a was
also evaluated. HR-HPV DNA was detected in 13.7% of the cases; however, only 2.7%
were positive for both HPV DNA and RNA. The highest percentage of HPV DNA/RNA
double positivity was found in oropharynx (9.4%), followed by larynx (1.7%) and
oral cavity (1.6%) (p = 0.02). More than half of HPV DNA/RNA-positive cases were 
p16INK4a -negative, while a considerable number of HPV RNA-negative cases were
p16INK4a -positive (17.9%). HPV16 was the major type associated with HNC (60.0%),
although cases positive for HPV18, 35 and 56 were also detected. Our data
indicate that the proportion and types of mucosal HR-HPV associated with HNC in
this central Indian region differ from those in other (developed) parts of the
world. This may be explained by differences in smoking and/or sexual behaviour
compared with North America and northern Europe. Moreover, we show that p16INK4a 
staining appeared not to be a good surrogate marker of HPV transformation in the 
Indian HNC cases.
