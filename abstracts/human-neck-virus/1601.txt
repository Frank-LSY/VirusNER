Large and comprehensive genomic surveys of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCC) are now greatly increasing our understanding of the diversity of this
disease and the key genomic changes that drive these tumors. The results from
these studies are beginning to inform the introduction of novel therapies for
patients with HNSCCs. Here, we review some of the key findings from recent
genomic studies of head and neck cancers, including the most comprehensive study 
to date from The Cancer Genome Atlas Network.
