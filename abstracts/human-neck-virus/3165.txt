BACKGROUND: Copy-number gain of the oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) occurs
frequently in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is associated with
adverse clinical outcome. We previously showed that OSMR overexpression renders
cervical SCC cells more sensitive to the major ligand oncostatin-M (OSM), which
increases migration and invasion in vitro. We hypothesised that a major
contribution to this phenotype would come from epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT).
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive integrated study, involving in vitro cell
line studies, in vivo animal models and numerous clinical samples from a variety 
of anatomical sites.
RESULTS: In independent sets of cervical, head/neck and lung SCC tissues, OSMR
expression levels correlated with multiple EMT-associated phenotypic markers and 
transcription factors. OSM treatment of OSMR overexpressing cervical SCC cells
produced consistent EMT changes and increased tumour sphere formation in
suspension culture. In a mouse model, OSMR overexpressing SCC cells treated with 
OSM showed significant increases in lung colonisation. The biological effects of 
exogenous OSM were mirrored by highly significant adverse overall survival in
cervical SCCs with OSMR overexpression (N=251).
CONCLUSIONS: OSM:OSMR interactions are able to induce EMT, increased cancer stem 
cell-like properties and enhanced lung colonisation in SCC cells. These changes
are likely to contribute to the highly significant adverse outcome associated
with OSMR overexpression in cervical SCCs.
