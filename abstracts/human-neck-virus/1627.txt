Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an accepted cause of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), and patients with HPV-associated HNSCC have a favorable
prognosis. Currently, there is no general guidance on the most appropriate
biomarkers for clinical assessment of HPV in these malignancies. We compared
PCR-based and serologic HPV assays, as well as p16 immunohistochemistry,
individually and in combination in a single population-based study to assess
their associations with overall survival among patients with HNSCC, and thus
their potential value as biomarkers. HPV16 serology was determined for 488
patients; immunohistochemical detection of p16 expression in tumors was conducted
in a subset of 233 cases, and PCR-based methods to assess the presence of HPV16
DNA in a subset of 179 cases of tumors. Considering each biomarker individually
in the subset of patients studied for all endpoints, seropositivity for the E6
and E7 proteins was significantly associated with enhanced all-cause survival in 
oropharyngeal disease [HR(E6/E7+) = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
0.02-0.3]. Neither the presence of HPV16 DNA nor p16 immunostaining was
associated with significant enhanced overall survival in oropharyngeal disease
(HR(DNA) = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.3-2.9; HR(p16) = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-1.1). However, the 
combination of HPV-positive DNA and E6 or E7 serology was associated with
enhanced overall survival in oropharyngeal disease (HR(DNA+/E6/E7+) = 0.1, 95% CI
= 0.02-1.0), whereas E6/E7 seronegative patients with evidence of HPV in tumor
DNA did not show any evidence of favorable survival (HR(DNA+/E6-/E7-) = 3.4, 95% 
CI = 0.6-18.1). Furthermore, patients with p16 staining and E6 or E7
seropositivity had favorable survival from oropharyngeal disease (HR(p16+/E6/E7+)
= 0.1, 95% CI = 0.02-0.4), whereas patients who were p16 positive and E6/E7
seronegative had significantly increased hazard of all causes of death
(HR(p16+/E6-/E7-) = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.2-7.7). A stronger association of HPV
presence with prognosis (assessed by all-cause survival) is observed when
"HPV-associated" HNSCC is defined using tumor status (HPV DNA status or P16) and 
HPV E6/E7 serology in combination rather using tumor HPV status alone.
