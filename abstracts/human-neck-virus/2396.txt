BACKGROUND: Lung cancers consist of four major types that and for
clinical-pathological reasons are often divided into two broad categories: small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All major
histological types of lung cancer are associated with smoking, although the
association is stronger for SCLC and squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma.
To date, epidemiological studies have identified several environmental, genetic, 
hormonal and viral factors associated with lung cancer risk. It has been
estimated that 15-25% of human cancers may have a viral etiology. The human
papillomavirus (HPV) is a proven cause of most human cervical cancers, and might 
have a role in other malignancies including vulva, skin, oesophagus, head and
neck cancer. HPV has also been speculated to have a role in the pathogenesis of
lung cancer. To validate the hypothesis of HPV involvement in small cell lung
cancer pathogenesis we performed a gene expression profile of transgenic mouse
model of SCLC induced by HPV-16 E6/E7 oncoproteins.
METHODS: Gene expression profile of SCLC has been performed using Agilent whole
mouse genome (4 × 44k) representing ~ 41000 genes and mouse transcripts. Samples 
were obtained from two HPV16-E6/E7 transgenic mouse models and from littermate's 
normal lung. Data analyses were performed using GeneSpring 10 and the functional 
classification of deregulated genes was performed using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com).
RESULTS: Analysis of deregulated genes induced by the expression of E6/E7
oncoproteins supports the hypothesis of a linkage between HPV infection and SCLC 
development. As a matter of fact, comparison of deregulated genes in our system
and those in human SCLC showed that many of them are located in the Aryl
Hydrocarbon Receptor Signal transduction pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the global gene expression of transgenic mouse model 
of SCLC induced by HPV-16 E6/E7 oncoproteins led us to identification of several 
genes involved in SCLC tumor development. Furthermore, our study revealed that
the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling is the primarily affected pathway by the 
E6/E7 oncoproteins expression and that this pathway is also deregulated in human 
SCLC. Our results provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic
approaches against human SCLC.
