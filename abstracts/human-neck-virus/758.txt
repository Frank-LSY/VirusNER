Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small circular, double-stranded DNA viruses
infecting epithelial tissues. HPV types can be classified both as high-risk or
low-risk. Of the more than 120 different identified types of HPV, the majority
are involved in infections of the genital tract, cancer of the cervix, vulva,
vagina and penis, and of non-anogenital localizations, such as the head and neck 
areas. From the point of view of the infection, human papillomaviruses have
developed several molecular mechanisms to enable infected cells to suppress
apoptosis. This review provides a comprehensive and critical summary of the
current literature that focuses on cervical carcinoma and cancer of the head and 
neck caused by HPV. In particular, we discuss HPV virology, the molecular
mechanisms of carcinogenesis, the role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and
the E6/E7 zinc finger proteins. Classification of HPV according to diagnosis is
also described.
