Squamous carcinomas of the head and neck area are carcinomas that were
traditionally associated with alcohol and tobacco abuse. More recently, a
pathogenic relationship of oncogenic human papilloma viruses (HPV) with head and 
neck cancer of the oropharynx and the base of the tongue has been revealed. Two
proteins of HPV, E6 and E7, are involved in neoplastic transformation not only in
the head and neck but in other locations, where these epitheliotropic viruses
cause carcinomas, such as the uterine cervix and the anal region. The E6 viral
protein associates with cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and promotes
degradation of tumour suppressor p53 by the proteasome. This molecular event
reveals the important role that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays in
the pathogenesis of head and neck cancer. The role of this system in head and
neck carcinogenesis is not restricted to the destruction of p53 but extends to
most, if not all, signaling pathways that regulate carcinogenesis in this
location. These roles are reviewed here and implications for treatment are
discussed.
