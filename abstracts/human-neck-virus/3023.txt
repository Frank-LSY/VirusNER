Primary nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma (NAC) accounts for approximately 0.5% of
all nasopharyngeal cancer. The diagnosis, staging and treatment of NAC has not
been well described. This article presents a literature review on NAC and
identifies its characteristics and management. The NAC group of diseases contains
various pathological types and has a series of specific clinical characteristics,
including slow progression, a low incidence of neck masses and frequent cranial
neuropathy. The Epstein-Barr virus may not play an important role in NAC
carcinogenesis. The rarity of the disease makes the staging classification and
treatment strategies of NAC parallel to those recommended for nasopharyngeal
squamous carcinoma. Some patients might benefit from surgery, and radiotherapy
using precise techniques might achieve good control for treating NAC, but the
roles of chemotherapy and target therapy are not clear. The proper staging system
and optimal treatment strategies need to be established in NAC.
