Hearing impairment is the most common sensory deficit. It is frequently caused by
the expression of an allele carrying a single dominant missense mutation. Herein,
we show that a single intracochlear injection of an artificial microRNA carried
in a viral vector can slow progression of hearing loss for up to 35 weeks in the 
Beethoven mouse, a murine model of non-syndromic human deafness caused by a
dominant gain-of-function mutation in Tmc1 (transmembrane channel-like 1). This
outcome is noteworthy because it demonstrates the feasibility of
RNA-interference-mediated suppression of an endogenous deafness-causing allele to
slow progression of hearing loss. Given that most autosomal-dominant
non-syndromic hearing loss in humans is caused by this mechanism of action,
microRNA-based therapeutics might be broadly applicable as a therapy for this
type of deafness.
