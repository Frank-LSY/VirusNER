The 'gold standard' for oncogenic HPV detection is the demonstration of
transcriptionally active high-risk HPV in tumor tissue. However, detection of
E6/E7 mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) requires RNA extraction which destroys the tumor tissue context
critical for morphological correlation and has been difficult to be adopted in
routine clinical practice. Our recently developed RNA in situ hybridization
technology, RNAscope, permits direct visualization of RNA in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue with single molecule sensitivity and single cell 
resolution, which enables highly sensitive and specific in situ analysis of any
RNA biomarker in routine clinical specimens. The RNAscope HPV assay was designed 
to detect the E6/E7 mRNA of seven high-risk HPV genotypes (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35,
52, and 58) using a pool of genotype-specific probes. It has demonstrated
excellent sensitivity and specificity against the current 'gold standard' method 
of detecting E6/E7 mRNA by qRT-PCR. HPV status determined by RNAscope is strongly
prognostic of clinical outcome in oropharyngeal cancer patients.
