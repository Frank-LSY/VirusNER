The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharynx cancer has
steadily increased over the past two decades and now represents a majority of
oropharyngeal cancer cases. Integration of the HPV genome into the host genome is
a common event during carcinogenesis that has clinically relevant effects if the 
viral early genes are transcribed. Understanding the impact of HPV integration on
clinical outcomes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is critical
for implementing deescalated treatment approaches for HPV+ HNSCC patients. RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) data from HNSCC tumors (n = 84) were used to identify and
characterize expressed integration events, which were overrepresented near known 
head and neck, lung, and urogenital cancer genes. Five genes were recurrent,
including CD274 (PD-L1) A significant number of genes detected to have
integration events were found to interact with Tp63, ETS, and/or FOX1A. Patients 
with no detected integration had better survival than integration-positive and
HPV- patients. Furthermore, integration-negative tumors were characterized by
strongly heightened signatures for immune cells, including CD4+, CD3+,
regulatory, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and B cells, compared with
integration-positive tumors. Finally, genes with elevated expression in
integration-negative specimens were strongly enriched with immune-related gene
ontology terms, while upregulated genes in integration-positive tumors were
enriched for keratinization, RNA metabolism, and translation.Implications: These 
findings demonstrate the clinical relevancy of expressed HPV integration, which
is characterized by a change in immune response and/or aberrant expression of the
integration-harboring cancer-related genes, and suggest strong natural selection 
for tumor cells with expressed integration events in key carcinogenic genes. Mol
