BACKGROUND: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a novel modality for the treatment of
skin nodules and cutaneous or subcutaneous tumors that allows delivery of low and
non-permeant drug into cells. The aim of this prospective single-center study was
to evaluate ECT efficacy in the local treatment of Classic Kaposi's sarcoma (CKS)
skin localization stage I-II sec. Brambilla et al.
METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients affected by classic KS were included in
this study. All patients underwent blood sampling and concurrent incisional
biopsy for histological diagnosis and Kaposi's sarcoma related herpes virus 8
(HHV-8) molecular analysis. ECT treatment of KS cutaneous lesions were performed 
according to the European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy
(ESOPE). The primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of ECT efficacy in 
the treatment of KS skin nodules and the assessment of HHV-8 viral load in the
peripheral blood following the ECT therapy.
RESULTS: Complete response (CR) was observed in 14 (73.6%) patients after first
ECT session, while 3 (15.7%) and 2 (10.5%) out of 19 patients received a second
and a third ECT treatment, respectively. Clinical response dragged out the whole 
follow-up period that ranged between 6 and 31 months with a median of 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical management of CKS skin localizations still represents a
challenging task for surgeons and oncologists. Therefore, according to this and
other author's recent experiences, ECT is claimed to become the "new standard of 
care" as first line treatment strategy for stage I-II CKS patients.
