BACKGROUND: Rabies viral infection causes a fatal encephalomyelitis. In humans,
classic features include hydrophobia, aerophobia, hypersalivation, agitation, and
neurological symptoms. In the Philippines, canine rabies contributes to a
significant burden of human disease.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1839 patients
admitted to San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, Philippines between 1987 and 2006, with 
a clinical diagnosis of rabies. We used the World Health Organization case
definition for clinical rabies, which is defined by the presence of hydrophobia.
RESULTS: Male patients outnumbered females by 2.2 to 1 and twice the number of
adults were affected compared with children. Most patients were indigent. Dog
bites occurred more than cat bites (97.1% vs. 2.9%) and most cases were caused by
a single bite (86.2%), compared to multiple bites (8.7%). Bites to the face,
head, and neck led to shorter incubation times, yet the incubation period varied,
with most cases (42.7%) occurring in the bracket of 91-365 days post-exposure.
Clinical symptoms included hydrophobia in all cases, as per our case definition, 
and aerophobia in 95.5%; only 9.4% had fever, 9.2% exhibited restlessness, and
6.7% exhibited hypersalivation. Localized neurological symptoms included pain
(4.1%), numbness (2.6%), and itching (2.3%). None of the patients received
appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
CONCLUSIONS: This study examines the largest cohort of rabies patients reported
to-date. Better understanding of clinical disease manifestations may help in
salvage efforts to save patients with rabies. Knowledge of epidemiological
factors will improve preventative efforts to reduce suffering from rabies.
