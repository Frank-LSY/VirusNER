BACKGROUND: Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has been proposed as an alternative to 
antibiotics. Phages have been shown to kill antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strains; however, it is unknown whether stress-induced antibiotic
tolerance affects S. aureus susceptibility to phages. Our objective was to
determine the effectiveness of 2 phages currently in clinical development,
against antibiotic-resistant and induced antibiotic-tolerant clinical S. aureus
isolates.
METHODS: Antibiotic tolerant S. aureus strains were induced by incubation with
increasing concentrations of gentamicin, mupirocin, and ciprofloxacin over time
and their susceptibility to 2 clinically relevant phages (Sa83 and Sa87) was
assessed. In addition, phage susceptibility was tested in relation to the
antibiotic sensitivity of 65 clinical S. aureus isolates, harvested from the
sinonasal cavities of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients. Phage sensitivity
was assessed using a plaque spot assay and by measuring optical density values to
observe planktonic S. aureus growth in the presence of the phage. Alamar Blue
assays were used to assess biofilm viability after phage treatment.
RESULTS: Frequency of antibiotic resistance amongst clinical S. aureus isolates
was 90.7% (59/65) with 13 of 65 (20.0%) identified as multidrug-resistant.
Tolerance to gentamicin, mupirocin, and ciprofloxacin was rapidly induced by
incubation with increasing concentrations of respective antibiotics. There was no
significant difference in phage sensitivity between antibiotic-sensitive and
resistant/tolerant S. aureus clinical isolates in planktonic and biofilm form.
CONCLUSION: Clinical S. aureus isolates from CRS patients have a high (20%)
incidence of multidrug resistance. Antibiotic resistance or tolerance did not
affect phage susceptibility of those isolates.
