Shugoshin-1 (Sgo1) protects the integrity of the centromeres, and H2A
phosphorylation is critical for this process. The mitotic checkpoint kinase Bub1,
phosphorylates H2A and ensures fidelity of chromosome segregation and chromosome 
number. Oncogenic KSHV induces genetic alterations through chromosomal
instability (CIN), and its essential antigen LANA regulates Bub1. We show that
LANA inhibits Bub1 phosphorylation of H2A and Cdc20, important for chromosome
segregation and mitotic signaling. Inhibition of H2A phosphorylation at residue
T120 by LANA resulted in dislocation of Sgo1, and cohesin from the centromeres.
Arrest of Cdc20 phosphorylation also rescued degradation of Securin and Cyclin B1
at mitotic exit, and interaction of H2A, and Cdc20 with Bub1 was inhibited by
LANA. The N-terminal nuclear localization sequence domain of LANA was essential
for LANA and Bub1 interaction, reversed LANA inhibited phosphorylation of H2A and
Cdc20, and attenuated LANA-induced aneuploidy and cell proliferation. This
molecular mechanism whereby KSHV-induced CIN, demonstrated that the NNLS of LANA 
is a promising target for development of anti-viral therapies targeting KSHV
associated cancers.
