The authors present a 90-year-old woman with unilateral glossopharyngeal, vagal
and spinal accessory cranial nerve palsy along with pharyngeal and laryngeal
vesicular eruptions. She was diagnosed with herpes zoster based on PCR testing on
vesicular fluid for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Reactivation of VZV in the head
and neck region can cause life-threatening neurologic sequelae. Clinicians should
be alert to the possibility of herpes zoster in a case of unilateral multiple
cranial neuropathies and rapid combination therapy with acyclovir and
corticosteroid should be initiated.
