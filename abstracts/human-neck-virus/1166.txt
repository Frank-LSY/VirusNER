The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) landscape is evolving with human 
papillomavirus (HPV) being a rising cause of oropharynx carcinoma (OPC). This
study seeks to investigate a national database for HPV-associated oropharynx
carcinoma (HPV-OPC). Using the National Cancer Data Base, we analyzed 22,693
patients with HPV-OPC and known HPV status. Chi-square tests and logistic
regression models were utilized to examine differences between HPV positive and
HPV negative OPC. 14,805 (65.2%) patients were HPV positive. Mean age at
presentation was 58.4 years with HPV-HNC patients being 2.8 years younger
compared to the HPV-negative cohort (58.4 vs. 61.2 years, p < 0.001). 67.6% of
white patients were HPV-positive compared to 42.3% of African American patients
and 57.1% of Hispanics (p < 0.001). When combining race and socioeconomic status 
(SES), we found African American patients in high SES groups had HPV-OPC
prevalence that was significantly higher than African American patients in low
SES groups (56.9% vs. 36.3%, p < 0.001). Geographic distribution of HPV-OPC was
also analyzed and found to be most prevalent in Western states and least
prevalent in the Southern states (p < 0.001). The distribution of HPV-OPC is
variable across the country and among racial and socioeconomic groups. A broad
understanding of these differences in HPV-OPC should drive educational programs
and improve clinical trials that benefit both prevention and current treatments.
