CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is involved in many human malignant tumors and
plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. To explore the effects of
CXCR4 expression on the malignant cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC),
Tca8113 and SCC-9 cell lines, as well as their xenograft models, of nude mice
were used to detect cancer cell proliferation alteration. This study also
examined the corresponding molecular mechanism after CXCR4 knockdown using a
recombinant lentiviral vector expressing small interference RNA (siRNA) for
CXCR4. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CXCR4 in highly aggressive (Tca8113
and SCC-9) tumor cells significantly inhibited the proliferation of the two cell 
lines in vitro and in vivo. The expression levels of >1,500 genes involved in
cell cycle, apoptosis, and multiple signaling pathways were also altered. These
results provide new evidence of CXCR4 as a promising tumor gene therapeutic
target.
