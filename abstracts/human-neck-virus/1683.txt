A previously healthy 31-year-old G4P2 woman at 33 weeks of gestation was admitted
as an emergency with a pyrexia of 39°C, vomiting, headache and neck stiffness
associated with photophobia, phonophobia and visual and auditory symptoms. There 
were no heraldic signs of eclampsia. Polymerase chain reaction and testing for
herpes simplex virus in the cerebrospinal fluid diagnosed herpes simplex-1
meningoencephalitis. Following acyclovir, the clinical course improved.
Spontaneous vaginal delivery occurred at 39 weeks of gestation with epidural
analgesia using ropivacaine. Mother and child were neurologically normal and
healthy 15 months later. Early administration of acyclovir is essential to reduce
the risk of neurological complications. After treatment and a negative polymerase
chain reaction for herpes simplex virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, epidural
analgesia with local anesthetic and sufentanil is possible.
