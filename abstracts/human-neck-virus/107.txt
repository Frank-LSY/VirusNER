Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated
condition characterized by infiltration of the involved organs by IgG4-bearing
plasma cells. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases, associated with or occurring
in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has been
increasing. We describe a 58-year-old man with an undiagnosed HIV infection,
which presented as chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with an elevated serum IgG4
and a very high IgE. Histologically, lymph nodes showed expanded sinusoids and
burnt-out germinal centers with increased plasmacytic infiltration and collagen
fiber deposition. The absolute number of IgG4+ plasma cells and the IgG4+/IgG+
plasma cell ratio was increased. The lymph nodes were enlarged and clinically the
patient improved after steroid treatment. Nine months later, he was diagnosed
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, following presentation with a cavitary 
left lung lesion. Immunohistochemical studies on the previously resected lymph
node revealed complete absence of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and increased CD8+
T-lymphocytes. The pathologic findings met the criteria of both HIV infection and
IgG4-related lymphadenopathy. Our case demonstrates that further investigations
for underlying HIV infection in a case of IgG4-RD are critical, especially when
extremely elevated IgE is concomitantly present.
