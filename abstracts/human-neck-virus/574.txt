OBJECTIVE: The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis (RRP). Although HPV prevalence is high, the incidence of
papillomatosis is low. Thus, factors other than HPV infection probably contribute
to RRP. This study investigated whether patients with papillomatosis are more
often infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 and chlamydia trachomatis (ChT)
and whether laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) occurs in this group of patients more 
often.
DESIGN: Prospective case-control study.
SETTING: Department of Otorhinolaryngology of University Hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 20 patients with adult-onset RRP and 20 adult
patients with vocal cord cyst and no pathology of laryngeal mucosa (control
group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunohistochemical analysis of pepsin, HPV, herpes
simplex virus type 2 and ChT was performed in biopsy specimens of laryngeal
papillomas and of healthy laryngeal mucosa (control group) obtained from medial
part of removed vocal cord cyst during microlaryngoscopy procedures.
RESULTS: Pathologic LPR (pepsin in tissue) was diagnosed in 8/20 (40.0%) patients
with papillomatosis and in 0/20 control patients (P = .003). Herpes simplex virus
type 2 was present in 9/20 (45.0%) patients with papillomatosis and in 0/20
control patients (P = .001). Five specimens were positive for both pepsin and
herpes simplex virus type 2. No samples were positive for ChT. There were no
significant differences between groups for age, body mass index, diabetes
mellitus and gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Tobacco exposure was not more
frequent in RRP group either (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Results show that LPR and herpes simplex virus type 2 are
significantly more often present in patients with RRP. LPR and herpes simplex
virus type 2 might activate latent HPV infection and thereby be possible risk
factors for RRP.
