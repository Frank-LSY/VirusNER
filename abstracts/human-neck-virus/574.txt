Sixty-seven percent of respondents systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 on HNSCC sites, while 58.3% report using test results to direct treatment for oropharyngeal cancers. A lack of official guidelines was the primary reason (81.8%) physicians did not use test results to direct treatment. Academic centre physicians (83.3%) and physicians with â©¾50% oncologic practice (87.6%) were more likely to test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC compared to non-academic centre physicians (39.7%) and physicians with <50% oncologic practices (51.4%) (p<0.001). Cost of the tests (69.2%), lack of relevance (46.1%) and time constraints (30.8%) were the primary reasons HPV-DNA and/or p16 were not tested.
