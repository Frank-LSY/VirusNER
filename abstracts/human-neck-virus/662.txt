A strong and consistent association has been reported between human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection and oropharyngeal cancer, whereas a similar link
has not yet been clarified in oral and laryngeal cancer. The purpose of this
study was to investigate the association between HPV infection and head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in Greek patients. Cytological or tissue
specimens from 172 cases patients with HNSCC and cytological specimens from 91
control subjects were analyzed for HPV DNA detection and genotyping using a
microarray-based assay. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate
odds ratios (ORs) for the association between the presence of HPV infection and
HNSCC for each of the tumor site, after adjustment for potential confounders. The
adjusted ORs for positivity to high-risk HPV infection for oropharyngeal and
laryngeal cancer were 20.3 (95% CI: 1.7-250.1) and 22.8 (95% CI: 2.5-206.2),
respectively. High-risk HPV infection was not significantly associated with oral 
cancer. HPV infection was independently associated with poorly differentiated
tumors (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1-7.5). Our results suggest a strong association of
high-risk HPV infection with oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. J. Med. Virol.
