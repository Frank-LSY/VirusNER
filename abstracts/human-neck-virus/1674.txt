BACKGROUND: Currently, positive surgical margins in head and neck cancer are
considered to be an indicator for postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over
radiotherapy (RT) alone. However, there are less data regarding the impact of
margin status on human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 55 patients with oropharyngeal
SCC undergoing primary surgical treatment. The impact of margin status on
disease-specific survival (DSS) was studied according to p16 status.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had positive margins. Adjuvant treatment in these
cases was CRT (n = 6), RT alone (n = 14), and none (n = 1). Among p16-negative
patients, positive margins and dysplasia at margins predicted significantly worse
DSS. Among patients with p16-positive disease, margin status had no impact on
DSS.
CONCLUSION: Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC and positive margins
after excision maintain a low risk of recurrence despite most receiving RT alone 
as adjuvant treatment. These findings raise questions regarding the additional
benefit of postoperative CRT in this group.
