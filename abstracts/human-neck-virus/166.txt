BACKGROUND: Currently, testing on HPV in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) is performed on histological material. However, in a certain percentage
of the cases who present with lymph node metastases no primary tumor can be
identified and only fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is available for
analysis.
OBJECTIVES: Purpose of this study was to assess HPV status on FNAC and to
validate it using histological material of the same patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients with cervical metastasis from OPSCC or cancer of an
unknown primary tumor (CUP), diagnosed between 2007 and 2012 were included. In 6 
of the 47 patients, no primary tumor could be identified. HPV detection and
genotyping was performed in both FNAC slides scrapings and formalin fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) histological material from the same patients, using the 
HPV SPF10-LiPA25 assay. HPV PCR analysis on FFPE material was considered the
reference standard for HPV status of each case.
RESULTS: Compared with HPV negative cases (n=22), significantly more HPV positive
cases (n=25) presented initially with cervical metastasis (27% vs 56%
respectively; p=0·047). The HPV PCR assay on FNAC material showed a high
sensitivity (96%; 95% CI 86.6-97.4) and specificity (100%; 95% CI 85.1-96.7)
using the reference standard of HPV PCR analysis on FFPE material of the same
patients.
CONCLUSION: In this study, testing on HPV in FNAC of cervical lymph node
metastases of SCC is validated. It provides a valuable alternative for testing of
HPV on histological material from patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma or cancer of an unknown primary tumor.
