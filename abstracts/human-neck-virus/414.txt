A six-year-old girl was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of swelling,
trismus, pain in the submandibular, submental and masticator area and vesicular
lesions on the mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve (C5, V3). We present this
case of head and neck space infection presenting with Herpes Simplex virus, as it
is rarely seen.
