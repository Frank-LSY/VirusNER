There were 179 patients included: 119 (66.5%) were male. Average age of patients was 64 years; 34% of the tumors were located in the oral cavity and 33% were located in the larynx. Factors associated with survival were ECOG (RR = 11.3; 2.6-48), clinical stage (RR = 7.8; 1.7-34), age >70 years (RR = 3.5, 1.4-8.5) and nonsurgical treatment (RR = 2.3; 1.4-3.8). Average overall survival for patients with HPV16 was 22 months vs. 28 months in those with other types of viruses. HPV infection was not associated with the prognosis in this series.
