OBJECTIVE: The treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) continues 
to be difficult. Adjuvant pharmacological treatment is increasingly being used,
and intralesional cidofovir injection remains the leading option. Almost all
papers regarding the treatment come from the United States and Europe. The
present study demonstrated it for the first time from Asia.
METHODS: Ten patients with RRP were treated with intralesional cidofovir
injection. The severity of papillomatosis and adverse events including blood
leukocytes, blood neutrophils, and serum creatinine were evaluated before and
after the completion of treatment.
RESULTS: Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 6 was detected in nine patients, and no 
types of HPV were detected in a remaining patient. Severity scores significantly 
improved after treatment (p=0.005). However, complete resolution was achieved in 
only one patient. No significant differences were observed between before and
after treatment with respect to adverse events (p=0.866 for blood leukocytes,
p=0.866 for blood neutrophils, and p=0.933 for serum creatinine). Squamous cell
carcinoma occurred three and half years after the completion of treatment in a
patient without HPV detection. However, the link between cidofovir and the
occurrence of carcinoma in the case remains questionable.
CONCLUSION: This initial report of intralesional cidofovir injection for RRP from
Asia demonstrated acceptable efficacy without obvious adverse events. However,
the uncontrolled spread of this treatment should be avoided, and eighteen
statements approved by the task force of the United States should be referred to 
while planning this treatment.
