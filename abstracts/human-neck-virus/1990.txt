PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between T-stage and primary tumor subsite
with clinical nodal metastasis in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all previously untreated
patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma evaluated by the
senior author in a tertiary-care center over a 5-year period was performed.
Medical records were evaluated for HPV status, clinical T-stage, clinical nodal
stage, and anatomic location of primary oropharyngeal subsite.
RESULTS: 83% (59/71) of patients presented with clinical nodal disease. T-stage
was not associated with the absence of regional disease (cN0) in tonsillar
complex or base of tongue cancers. However, early T1/T2 tonsillar complex cancers
were less likely to present with cN2c disease compared to T3/T4 lesions (0% vs.
18-33%, p=0.03). Further, base of tongue cancers were more likely to present with
cN2c disease compared to tonsillar complex tumors (35% vs. 7%, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: In HPV-positive tonsillar complex cancers, T-stage does not appear to
predict the presence of clinical nodal metastasis (N0 vs. N1-N3), but may predict
the extent of metastasis when present. This association does not appear to affect
base of tongue cancers. Further, base of tongue cancers have a greater incidence 
of cN2c disease compared to tonsillar complex cancers.
