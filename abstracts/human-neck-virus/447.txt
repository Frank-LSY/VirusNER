In recent years, there has been an increase in the annual incidence of HPV-related HNSCC in the United States and Europe. It has now become clear that a subset of HNSCC is a sexually transmitted disease with distinct pathogenesis and clinical/pathological features. HPV-associated HNSCCs have a better prognosis compared with stage-matched non-HPV-related HNSCC in the majority of studies. Research efforts are now focusing on deintensification of treatment to reduce treatment-associated morbidity. HPV-targeted therapies are under investigation.
