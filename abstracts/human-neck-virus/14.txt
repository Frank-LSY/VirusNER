We have developed a virus detection and discovery computational pipeline,
Pickaxe, and applied it to NGS databases provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We analyzed a collection of whole genome (WGS), exome (WXS), and RNA
(RNA-Seq) sequencing libraries from 3052 participants across 22 different
cancers. NGS data from nearly all tumor and normal tissues examined contained
contaminating viral sequences. Intensive computational and manual efforts are
required to remove these artifacts. We found that several different types of
cancers harbored Herpesviruses including EBV, CMV, HHV1, HHV2, HHV6 and HHV7. In 
addition to the reported associations of Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV & HCV) with
liver cancer, and Human papillomaviruses (HPV) with cervical cancer and a subset 
of head and neck cancers, we found additional cases of HPV integrated in a small 
number of bladder cancers. Gene expression and mutational profiles suggest that
HPV drives tumorigenesis in these cases.
