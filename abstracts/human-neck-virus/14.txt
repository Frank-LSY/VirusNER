93 patients with HNSCC were included. Sensitivity and specificity of the brush test were 83% (95%CI: 67-92%) and 85% (95%CI: 72-93%). Results of p16 IHC were concordant with FFPE samples DNA determinations in 73/93 patients. In 53 patients (57%) the tumor was located in the oropharynx and in 40 patients (43%) the tumor was located in the non-oropharynx region. Sensitivity and specificity of the brush test in patients with oropharyngeal cancer was higher with 86% (95%CI: 70-95%) and 89% (95%CI: 65-99%).
