BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) is associated with better prognosis than HPV-negative
oropharyngeal SCC. The purpose of this study was to assess the expression of
insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in patients with oropharyngeal
SCC, its relationship to HPV status and various clinical parameters, and its
relationship with clinical outcome.
METHODS: The study subjects were 59 patients with oropharyngeal SCC. IGF-1R
expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumor
tissues. HPV status was evaluated by in situ hybridization (ISH) in the same
tissues.
RESULTS: IGF-1R did not correlate with clinical parameters, but IGF-1R expression
was more common in HPV-negative tumors than in HPV-positive tumors. The prognosis
was poorer in patients of the IGF-1R-positive group than in the IGF-1R-negative
group.
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that IGF-1R expression in oropharyngeal SCC
correlated with poor prognosis in HPV-negative patients. Treatment targeting
IGF-1R could potentially improve the survival of patients with HPV-negative
oropharyngeal SCC.
