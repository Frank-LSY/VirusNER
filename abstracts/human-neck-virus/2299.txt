BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major public health
problem in India because of high mortality rate and residual neuropsychiatric
damage in the survivors. The present study was undertaken to investigate JE
positivity amongst patients admitted with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in
upper Assam districts and different parameters with their changing trends related
to it.
METHODS: It was a hospital-based prospective cross-sectional study conducted from
January 2012 to December 2014. A total of 1707 consecutive non-repetitive
hospitalized patients, satisfying the clinical case definition of AES as per the 
WHO guidelines, were included in the study. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum
samples were tested for JEV-specific IgM antibodies.
RESULTS: Of the 1707 patients admitted, 696 (40.77 %) were diagnosed as JE with
male-to-female ratio 1.7:1 and adult to paediatric ratio 2.2:1. Fever (100%),
change in mental status (100%), headache (80.02%), neck rigidity (52.01%),
unconsciousness (48.99%), seizure (37.64%) and paralysis (11.06%) were the major 
clinical findings. The majority of cases (94%) were from rural areas. There was a
significant association of JE cases with rainy season of the year i.e., June to
August (P<0.001). Overall, 14.94 per cent deaths were reported in JE positive
cases.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A higher occurrence of JE was observed in above 15 
yr age group. Cases were mainly from rural areas, and there was clustering of
cases in rainy season.
