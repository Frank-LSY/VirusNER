Syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP) most frequently arises from an organoid
nevus on the head and neck. Zonal or segmental lesions occurring in other
locations are rare. Here, we report a case of a 39-year-old woman with an SCAP
clinically mimicking verruca vulgaris in a zonal distribution on her right axilla
after her birth. Histopathologic examination showed it to be a typical SCAP.
Furthermore, the tumor had a warty surface, which histologically revealed some
signs of viral infection. Although polymerase chain reactions for low- and
high-risk human papilloma virus types were negative, the relationship of SCAP
with viral infection needs further investigation.
