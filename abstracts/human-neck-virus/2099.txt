Degenerated Keratinized Tumor Cells in Oropharyngeal Human Papilloma
Virus-Associated Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Pitfall in p16 Immunostaining of
Fine-Needle Aspiration Specimens.

Wei S, Ehya H.

OBJECTIVE: High-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) testing should be performed on
all patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal HPV-associated squamous cell
carcinoma (OPHPVSCC), and p16 immunostaining can be used as a surrogate marker.
Although in surgical pathology specimens p16 staining in > 70% of the tumor cells
is considered a positive result, the interpretation in fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) specimens has remained controversial.
STUDY DESIGN: FNA of neck lymph nodes and corresponding surgical specimens from
42 patients with OPHPVSCC were reviewed.
RESULTS: In FNA specimens, 38 cases (90.5%) had viable tumor cells, 32 (76.2%)
had keratin debris, and 36 (85.7%) had degenerated keratinized tumor cells.
Twenty-seven of 27 (100%) had positive p16 staining in > 70% of viable tumor
cells, while the degenerated tumor cells were negative. Twenty of 24 (83.3%)
primary OPHPVSCC exhibited focal degenerated keratinized tumor cells and/or
keratin debris.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the majority of the OPHPVSCC metastases in
lymph nodes had degenerated keratinized tumor cells and keratin debris. Many
primary OPHPVSCC also demonstrated focal keratinization and/or degeneration. The 
degenerated tumor cells showed no immunoreactivity to p16. The same 70% cutoff
used in histologic specimens should be applied in cytologic specimens, but only
the viable tumor cells should be counted.
