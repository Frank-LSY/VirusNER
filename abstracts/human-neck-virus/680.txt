Swallowing and swallowing-related impairments present important posttreatment
challenges in individuals undergoing organ preservation therapy for head and neck
cancer. Literature pertinent to this topic is reviewed. A protocol for treatment 
of speech and swallowing deficits related to oropharyngeal cancer and treatment
performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital is described. Data collected from a sample of
oropharyngeal patients with cancer, with and without human papillomavirus-related
disease, are summarized. Future directions for further study of this population
are discussed.
