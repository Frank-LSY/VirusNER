HPV may play an etiological role at least in some SCC in situ arising in extragenital sites. Sunprotected sites may be more dependent on HPV-mediated co-carcinogenesis than sun exposed areas. The presence of the p16-expression, papillomatosis or koilocyte-like change is not a reliable marker of HPV infection in SCC in situ.
