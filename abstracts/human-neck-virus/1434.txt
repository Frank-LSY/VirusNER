Tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (TSCCs) are the most common human
papillomavirus- (HPV-) associated oropharyngeal cancers with poor prognosis.
Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a central regulator of p53,
which participates in apoptosis during the DNA damage response. HIPK2 is involved
in HPV-associated uterine cervical and cutaneous carcinogenesis through its
binding of HPV E6, thereby preventing apoptosis and contributing to tumor
progression. However, its clinical and prognostic significance in TSCC remains
unclear. HIPK2 mRNA levels were analyzed in 20 normal tonsils and 20 TSCC
specimens using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Immunohistochemistry of HIPK2 was performed in 79 resected specimens. HIPK2 was
expressed in 57% of the TSCCs, and HIPK2 protein expression and HIPK2 mRNA levels
were higher in TSCCs than in normal tonsils. HIPK2 overexpression was associated 
with poorly differentiated carcinoma and low alcohol consumption and was an
independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival
(DFS) in TSCC and a negative independent prognostic factor for DFS in patients
receiving postoperative radiotherapy. HIPK2 overexpression had a significant
association with poorer DFS in HPV-positive TSCCs, but not in HPV-negative
tumors. HIPK2 overexpression may be a potential prognostic marker for predicting 
prognoses and a high risk of recurrence, particularly in patients with
HPV-positive TSCC.
