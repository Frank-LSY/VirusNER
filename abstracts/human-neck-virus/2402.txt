BACKGROUND: Newborn screening for urinary cytomegalovirus (CMV) and early
introduction of antiviral treatment are expected to improve neurological outcomes
in symptomatic congenital CMV-infected infants. This cohort study prospectively
evaluated neurological outcomes in symptomatic congenital CMV-infected infants
following the introduction of hospital-based newborn urinary CMV screening and
antiviral treatment.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Following institutional review board approval and written
informed consent from their parents, newborns were prospectively screened from
2009 to 2014 for urinary CMV-DNA by PCR within 1 week after birth at Kobe
University Hospital and affiliated hospitals. CMV-positive newborns were further 
examined at Kobe University Hospital, and those diagnosed as symptomatic were
treated with valganciclovir for 6 weeks plus immunoglobulin. Clinical
neurological outcomes were evaluated at age ⩾12 months and categorized by the
presence and severity of neurologic sequelae.
RESULTS: Urine samples of 6348 newborns were screened, with 32 (0.50%) positive
for CMV. Of these, 16 were diagnosed with symptomatic infection and 12 received
antiviral treatment. Four infants developed severe impairment (33%), three
developed mild impairment (25%), and five developed normally (42%).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Japanese report of neurological assessments in
infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection who received early diagnosis
and antiviral treatment. Urinary screening, resulting in early diagnosis and
treatment, may yield better neurological outcomes in symptomatic congenital
CMV-infected infants.
