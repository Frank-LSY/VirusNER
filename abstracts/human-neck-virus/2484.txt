The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) continues to
rise because of increasing rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Inherited polymorphisms in DNA repair pathways may influence the risk of SCCOP
development and the prognosis of SCCOP. We sought to determine whether
polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites within 3'-untranslated regions
(3'UTRs) of genes in DNA repair pathways modulate the risk of SCCOP recurrence.
We evaluated the associations between nine such polymorphisms and SCCOP
recurrence in 1,008 patients with incident SCCOP using the log-rank test and
multivariable Cox models. In an analysis of all the patients, patients with
variant genotypes of BRCA1 rs12516 and RAD51 rs7180135 had better disease-free
survival (log-rank, p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0003, respectively) and lower risk of
SCCOP recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.8, 
and HR, 0.5, 95% CI, 0.3-0.9, respectively) than patients with common homozygous 
genotypes of the two polymorphisms after multivariable adjustment. Moreover, in
tumor HPV16-positive patients, patients with variant genotypes of the same two
polymorphisms also had better disease-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.004 and
p = 0.003, respectively) and lower recurrence risk (HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1-0.6, and
HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.0-0.7, respectively) than patients with common homozygous
genotypes of the two polymorphisms. No such significant associations were found
for other polymorphisms. These findings support significant roles of BRCA1
rs12516 and RAD51 rs7180135 in modifying the risk of recurrence of SCCOP,
particularly HPV16-positive SCCOP. However, these results must be validated in
larger studies.
