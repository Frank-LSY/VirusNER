In a prospective cohort study, women with abnormal cervical cytology admitted to our colposcopy units received HPV testing of the uterine cervix and the oropharynx via smear. From a subset of patients, oral lavage was collected to compare detection rates of HPV DNA between lavage and swab. Patients with confirmed high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)-positive HSIL of the cervix were further investigated. Sexual behavior and lifestyle factors were documented with a standardized questionnaire.
