Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). These HPV-related cancers have a clinicopathologic profile that diverges from HPV-negative HNSCCs. Accordingly, HPV testing may soon become integrated into standard pathologic assessment of HNSCCs.
