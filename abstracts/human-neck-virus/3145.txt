Phytotherapeutic pharmaceuticals and herbal medicinal products with its roots in 
classical phytotherapeutic medicine have a well-established role in
otolaryngological therapy, especially for diseases of the upper airways and acute
and chronic infections. A thorough selection and application could mean huge
benefit for the patient, in particular in cases with contraindications, chemo-
and antibiotic resistance or patient request. Besides, it might spare other
medications. Phytotherapeutic pharmaceuticals must fulfil the same criteria of
quality, effectiveness and harmlessness of evidence-based medicine like chemical 
pharmaceuticals, although they are often prescribed due to its well established
or traditional based use. This review focuses on phytotherapeutic therapies well 
established within the European Community for otolaryngologic disease patterns by
referring to clinical studies or meta-analysis.
