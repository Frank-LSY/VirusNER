The ESCRT machinery along with the AAA+ ATPase Vps4 drive membrane scission for
trafficking into multivesicular bodies in the endocytic pathway and for the
topologically related processes of viral budding and cytokinesis, but how they
accomplish this remains unclear. Using deep-etch electron microscopy, we find
that endogenous ESCRT-III filaments stabilized by depleting cells of Vps4 create 
uniform membrane-deforming conical spirals which are assemblies of specific
ESCRT-III heteropolymers. To explore functional roles for ESCRT-III filaments, we
examine HIV-1 Gag-mediated budding of virus-like particles and find that
depleting Vps4 traps ESCRT-III filaments around nascent Gag assemblies.
Interpolating between the observed structures suggests a new role for Vps4 in
separating ESCRT-III from Gag or other cargo to allow centripetal growth of a
neck constricting ESCRT-III spiral.
