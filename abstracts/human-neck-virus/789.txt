BACKGROUND: We aimed to provide updated information about the global estimates of
attributable fraction and type distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: We did a literature search on PubMed to identify studies that used PCR
for detection of HPV DNA in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas with
information about HPV genotype distribution. We included studies that tested 20
or more biopsies per cancer site and were published between July 15, 1990, and
Feb 29, 2012. We collected information about sex, risk factors, HPV detection
methods, and biomarkers of potentially HPV-induced carcinogenesis (E6/E7 mRNA and
p16(INK4a)). If it was not possible to abstract the required information directly
from the paper, we contacted the authors. We did a meta-analysis to produce
pooled prevalence estimates including a meta-regression to explore sources of
heterogeneity.
FINDINGS: 148 studies were included, contributing data for 12 163 cases of head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma from 44 countries. HPV DNA was detected in 3837 
cases. HPV16 accounted for 82·2% (95% CI 77·7-86·4) of all HPV DNA positive
cases. By cancer site, pooled HPV DNA prevalence estimates were 45·8% (95% CI
38·9-52·9) for oropharynx, 22·1% (16·4-28·3) for larynx (including hypopharynx), 
and 24·2% (18·7-30·2) for oral cavity. The percent positivity of p16(INK4a)
positive cases in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer cases was 86·7% (95% CI
79·2-92·9) and of E6/E7 mRNA positive cases was 86·9% (73·2-96·8). The estimate
of HPV attributable fraction in oropharyngeal cancer defined by expression of
positive cases of E6/E7 mRNA was 39·8% and of p16(INK4a) was 39·7%. Of subsites, 
tonsils (53·9%, 95% CI 46·4-61·3) had the highest HPV DNA prevalence. HPV DNA
prevalence varied significantly by anatomical site, geographic region, but not by
sex or tobacco or alcohol consumption.
INTERPRETATION: The contribution of HPV prevalence in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma and in particular that of HPV16 in the oropharynx shows the potential
benefit of prophylactic vaccines.
