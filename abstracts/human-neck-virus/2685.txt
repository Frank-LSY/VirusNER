An association between hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and Kikuchi's
disease is rarely seen in children. Here, we present the case of a male
adolescent (age 16 years and 3 months) who suffered from spiking fever for more
than 1 week, and multiple nodules over the neck and bilateral axilla for 2
months. A skin rash also developed over all four limbs, abdomen and face.
Laboratory data and skin biopsy gave results compatible with a diagnosis of
Kikuchi's disease. Hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, hyper-triglyceridemia,
elevated ferritin, and splenomegaly were also found, fulfilling the criteria for 
HLH. A recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection was also diagnosed by
serology. The patient ran a relatively benign course. Intravenous
immunoglobulins, steroids or etoposide-containing regimens were not used, and his
recovery was uneventful. A review of the literature showed that up to February
2009, 11 additional cases of Kikuchi's disease presenting simultaneously with, or
mimicking, HLH had been reported. Complete resolution within several weeks, with 
no recurrence, was seen in all but one patient (a pregnant woman).
