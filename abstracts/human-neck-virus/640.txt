The cervix was the most frequently studied cancer site followed by the head and neck. Overall risk of cancer (cancer vs. control) was the most common comparison, whereas reports of initiation (pre-cancer vs. control) and progression (cancer vs. pre-cancer) were rare. Case-series and joint-effect of HPV and genotype on risk was evaluated frequently, but the independent effect of either risk factor alone was rarely provided. P53-Arg72Pro was the most commonly studied polymorphism studied. No consistent interaction was detected by meta-analysis in the HPV(+) [OR 0.98 (0.55-1.76)] or the HPV(-) [OR 1.10 (0.76-1.60)] subsets in head and neck cancer risk. Polymorphisms in genes known to encode proteins that physically interact with HPV were infrequently studied.
