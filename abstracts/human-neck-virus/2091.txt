BACKGROUND: This study was carried out to determine the role of plasma
Epstein-Barr virus (pEBV)-DNA and positron-emission tomography (PET)-CT scan in
predicting the outcome of nasopharyngectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy for
recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, we recruited patients who had local or regional
recurrent NPC after radiotherapy. The relationship between preoperative pEBV-DNA 
level, maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax), and surgical outcome was analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients had local tumor recurrence. Their median pEBV-DNA
level and SUVmax were 348 copies and 4.7, respectively. Both values were
significantly lower than those with palliative nasopharyngectomy. Twenty-two
patients had regional failure. Their mean pEBV-DNA level and tumor SUVmax were
626 copies and 7.6, respectively. The metastatic lymph nodes with extracapsular
spread had a significantly higher mean SUVmax.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative pEBV-DNA and PET-CT predict the surgical outcome of
nasopharyngectomy for recurrent NPC. Similarly, PET-CT scan predicts the presence
of extracapsular spread of metastatic lymph nodes. These patients may warrant
further postoperative adjuvant therapy.
