OBJECTIVES: The standard concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens for
patients with oropharyngeal cancer are highly toxic. Human papillomavirus
(HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has recently
emerged as a distinct biological and clinical entity with improved response to
treatment and prognosis. A tailored therapeutic approach is needed to optimize
patient care. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of HPV and
smoking status on early toxicities (primarily mucositis) associated with
concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with OPSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 72 consecutive patients with 
OPSCC and known HPV status treated with concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
at our institution. Treatment-related toxicities were stratified by smoking and
HPV status and compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: HPV-positive patients had a 6.86-fold increase in the risk of having
severe, grade 3-4 mucositis. This effect was preserved after adjusting for
patient smoking status, nodal stage, radiotherapy technique and radiotherapy
maximum dose. Additionally, HPV status had significant effect on the objective
weight loss during treatment and at three months after treatment. Consistently,
non-smokers had a significant 2.70-fold increase in the risk of developing severe
mucositis.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for OPSCC modify the incidence of treatment-related
early toxicities, with HPV-positive and non-smoking status correlating with
increased risk of high grade mucositis and associated outcomes. Retrospective
single-institution studies need to be interpreted cautiously. However, this
finding is important to consider when designing therapeutic strategies for
HPV-positive patients and merits further investigation in prospective clinical
trials.
