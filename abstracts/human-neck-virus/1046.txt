Herpesviruses have been associated with various human malignancies and with
thyroid autoimmunity. Aiming to investigate the presence of these viruses in
thyroid nodules, we analyzed serum and thyroid tissue from 183 patients (83
benign and 100 malignant thyroid nodules). We also obtained 104 normal thyroid
tissues extracted from the contralateral lobe of these patients. We used ELISA to
screen the serology of all patients and a real-time quantitative PCR to analyze
thyroid tissue viral load in antibody-positive patients. In addition, the
presence of herpesviruses was tested by histological analysis in 20 EBV-positive 
tissues using the expression of LMP-1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and EBER by
in situ hybridization (ISH). There was no evidence of HSV-2 or CMV DNA, but we
found EBV DNA sequences in 29 (16%) thyroid tissue samples. We also found 7
positive EBV cases out of 104 normal tissues. Viral load was higher in tumors
than in their respective normal tissues (p = 0.0002). ISH analysis revealed EBER 
expression in 11 out of 20 (52%) EBV-positive tissues, mostly in malignant cases 
(8/11, 73%). The presence of high EBV copy numbers in thyroid tumors and the
expression of EBER only in malignant cases suggest an association between EBV and
thyroid malignancies. However, we did not find any association between the
presence of EBV and/or its viral load and any clinical or pathological tumor
feature. Further studies aiming to clarify the mechanisms of EBV infection in
thyroid cells are necessary to support a possible role in the development of
thyroid cancer.
