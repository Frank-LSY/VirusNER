The World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 Classification of Head and Neck Tumors
("Blue Book") will now include a new chapter on tumors and tumor-like lesions of 
the neck and lymph nodes, which was not included in the previous edition. Tumors 
and tumor-like lesions, including a variety of cysts and metastases, can arise in
any component in the neck, including soft tissue, lymph nodes, and developmental 
remnants. The pathology and clinical features of metastatic carcinoma of unknown 
primary in the head and neck has changed dramatically in the last several years. 
Many of these tumors which were previously diagnosed as unknown primary are now
identified as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas related to human
papillomavirus (HPV), less commonly to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and occasionally 
even to Merkel cell polyomavirus. Many unusual features can arise in these
metastases, such as undifferentiated morphology, extensive cystic change with
central degeneration, gland formation, and even ciliated cells. Rarely, carcinoma
in the neck can arise in association with a heterotopic tissue, primarily thyroid
or salivary gland tissue. Tumor-like lesions include branchial cleft cysts,
thyroglossal duct cyst, dermoid and teratoid cyst, and ranula. Pathologists
should be familiar with the diagnostic features and clinicopathologic corrections
of these neck lesions in order to correctly diagnosis them and to provide for
proper clinical management. This article will briefly describe the pathologic and
clinical features of these entities as they are covered in the new 2017 Blue
Book.
