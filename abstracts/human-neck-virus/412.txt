The three most important prognostic factors in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are tumor size, nodular histological condition and tumor origin. Recently, human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly HPV-16, has been acknowledged as a prognostic factor. HPV+ patients have better survival than HPV-. This has created a controversy because other factors may influence the prognosis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether HPV has prognostic value in patients with HNSCC.
