BACKGROUND: An epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal
squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has been reported worldwide largely due to oral
infection with HPV type-16, which is responsible for approximately 90% of
HPV-positive cases. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: A retrospective search identified ninety-five patients diagnosed with
OPSCC. Pre-treatment biopsy specimens were tested for p16 expression using
immunohistochemistry and for HPV-16, HPV-18 and other high-risk subtypes,
including 31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,67,68, by real-time qPCR.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine tumours (62%) were positive for p16 expression and fifty
(53%) were positive for known high-risk HPV types. Of the latter, 45 tumors (90%)
were identified as HPV-16 positive, and five tumors (10%) were positive for other
high-risk HPV types (HPV-18 (2), HPV-67 (2), HPV-33 (1)). HPV status by qPCR and 
p16 expression were extremely tightly correlated (p < 0.001, Fishers exact test).
Patients with HPV-positive tumors had improved 3-year overall (OS) and
disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients with HPV-negative tumors (90% vs
65%, p = 0.001; and 85% vs 49%, p = 0.005; respectively). HPV-16 related OPSCC
presented with cervical metastases more frequently than other high-risk HPV types
(p = 0.005) and poorer disease-free survival was observed, although this was not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: HPV-16 infection is responsible for a significant proportion of OPSCC
in Southwestern Ontario. Other high-risk subtypes are responsible for a smaller
subset of OPSCC that present less frequently with cervical metastases and may
have a different prognosis.
