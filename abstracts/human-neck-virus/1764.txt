The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiologic and transformational agent
in inverted Schneiderian papilloma (ISP) is unclear. Indeed, reported detection
rates of HPV in ISPs range from 0 to 100%. The true incidence has been confounded
by a tendency to conflate high- and low-risk HPV types and by the inability to
discern biologically relevant from irrelevant HPV infections. The recent
development of RNA in situ hybridization for high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA now allows 
the direct visualization of transcriptionally active high-risk HPV in ISP,
providing an opportunity to more definitively assess its role in the development 
and progression of ISPs. We performed p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV 
RNA in situ hybridization on 30 benign ISPs, 7 ISPs with dysplasia, 16 ISPs with 
carcinomatous transformation, and 7 non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas
(SCCs) with inverted growth that were unassociated with ISP. Transcriptionally
active HPV was not detected in any of the 52 ISPs including those that had
undergone carcinomatous transformation, but it was detected in two of seven (29%)
non-keratinizing SCCs that showed inverted growth. There was a strong correlation
between high-risk HPV RNA in situ hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry
(97%; p < 0.01). These results indicate that transcriptionally active high-risk
HPV does not play a common role in either the development of ISP or in its
transformation into carcinoma.
