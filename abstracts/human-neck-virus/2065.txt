CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) is considered to be a distinct entity in Japan. The combination
of both HPV-DNA sequencing analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16(INK4A)
is useful to discriminate the OPSCC patients with a better prognosis from other
cases, especially in the advanced stage. Surgical treatment is recommended for
HPV-negative advanced cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The number of HPV-related OPSCCs has been increasing worldwide.
However, the incidence and prognostic significance of this cancer in Japan have
not yet been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Seventy-seven Japanese patients with OPSCC were enrolled in this study. 
The prevalence of HPV-DNA was assessed by PCR and sequencing. The expression of
p16(INK4A) and p53 was examined by IHC. The clinicopathological parameters and
disease-specific survival were analyzed for HPV-positive and -negative patients.
RESULTS: HPV-DNA was detected in 32 patients. Thirty-four patients were
p16(INK4A)-positive by IHC. The patients who were positive for HPV infection were
significantly younger. Furthermore, in the stage III or IV cases, the 3-year
disease-specific survival of the HPV infection-positive group was significantly
better than that of the HPV-negative group. Surgical treatment was demonstrated
to lead to a good prognosis for the patients with HPV-negative advanced cancer.
