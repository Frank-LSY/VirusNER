This case report describes the use of CO2 laser and quadrivalent human
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in two patients with nasopharyngeal
HPV11-positive recurrent respiratory papillomas (RRP). These patients initially
underwent CO2 laser excision but developed recurrent lesions and underwent HPV
vaccination as adjunct therapy. The recurrent lesions shrank after vaccination
and were again excised with CO2 laser. Subsequently, these patients had no
recurrence of lesions on long-term follow-up at 33 months or 6 years after
surgery. Thus, in patients with nasopharyngeal RRP, resection with CO2 laser, and
HPV vaccination as adjunct therapy should be considered in HPV11-associated
cases. Laryngoscope, 127:2279-2281, 2017.
