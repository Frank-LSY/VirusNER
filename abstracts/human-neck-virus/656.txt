Patients with HNSCC demonstrate poor prognosis and survival time with standard therapy, especially in patients with advanced HNSCC. Recurrence and metastasis have not yet been effectively controlled. The immune profile in HNSCC, whether caused by carcinogen exposure or human papillomavirus (HPV), showed significantly immunosuppression.
