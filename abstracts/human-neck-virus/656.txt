HPV-positive head and neck cancers: a review of the literature.

Minassian M.

PURPOSE: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD)
that is rampant among young adults and is linked with cervical and oropharyngeal 
cancers (OPC). As the preventive arm of oral health care, dental hygienists can
take the lead in educating the young adult population about risk factors for HPV 
and OPC. Dental hygienists' active involvement in educational initiatives may
help minimize the spread of HPV associated STDs, prevent transmission of HPV to
the head and neck region, and decrease the development of OPC.
