OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16, is a causative agent
for 25% of head and neck squamous cell cancer, including laryngeal squamous cell 
cancer (LSCC). HPV-positive (HPV+ve) patients, particularly those with
oropharyngeal SCC, have improved prognosis. For LSCC patients, this remains to be
established. The goal was to determine stage and survival outcomes in LSCC in the
context of HPV infection.
STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
SETTING: Primary care academic health system.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 79 patients with primary LSCC, HPV was determined using 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Ï‡(2) or Fisher exact test was
used to test the association of HPV+ve with 21 risk factors including race,
stage, gender, age, smoking, alcohol, treatment, and health insurance.
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to study the association of HPV and
LSCC survival outcome.
RESULTS: HPV16 was detected in 27% of LSCC patients. Caucasian American (CA)
patients had higher HPV prevalence (33%) than did African American (AA) LSCC
patients (16%; P = .058). HPV was significantly associated with gender (P = .016)
and insurance type (P = .001). There were no differences in survival between
HPV+ve and HPV-negative (HPV-ve) patients. There was no association with HPV and 
other risk factors including stage (early vs late).
CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of HPV in men and a lower prevalence of
HPV infection in AA compared with CA. Despite the strikingly better survival of
patients with HPV+ve oropharyngeal tumors, even when adjusted for smoking, this
correlation does not seem to hold true in the larynx. Larger multiethnic LSCC
cohorts are needed to more clearly delineate HPV-related survival across
ethnicities.
