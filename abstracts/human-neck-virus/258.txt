JC polyomavirus (JCV) persistently infects the urinary tract of most adults.
Under conditions of immune impairment, JCV causes an opportunistic brain disease,
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). JCV strains found in the
cerebrospinal fluid of PML patients contain distinctive mutations in surface
loops of the major capsid protein, VP1. We hypothesized that VP1 mutations might 
allow the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralization. Consistent with this
hypothesis, neutralization serology revealed that plasma samples from PML
patients neutralized wild-type JCV strains but failed to neutralize
patient-cognate PML-mutant JCV strains. This contrasted with serological results 
for healthy individuals, most of whom robustly cross-neutralized all tested JCV
variants. Mice administered a JCV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine initially
showed neutralizing "blind spots" (akin to those observed in PML patients) that
closed after booster immunization. A PML patient administered an experimental JCV
VLP vaccine likewise showed markedly increased neutralizing titer against her
cognate PML-mutant JCV. The results indicate that deficient humoral immunity is a
common aspect of PML pathogenesis and that vaccination may overcome this humoral 
deficiency. Thus, vaccination with JCV VLPs might prevent the development of PML.
