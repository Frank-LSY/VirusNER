BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity improves prognosis in patients 
with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Combining HPV status with
other biomarkers may improve its prognostic power.
METHODS: The approach was a literature search for longitudinal studies of
biomarkers in OPSCC, with systematic review and meta-analysis.
RESULTS: In all, 3130 articles were identified; 32 satisfied the inclusion and
exclusion criteria. On meta-analysis, there was a significant overall survival
(OS) benefit for patients with HPV positive and p16 positive tumors. There was
some evidence of improved OS of OPSCC patients with raised bcl2; amplification of
11q3 and loss of 16q genes; and low c-met, ki67, IMD, PLK, FHIT, nuclear
surviving, or nuclear cyclin D1. However, none of these was suitable for
meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: Survival from OPSCC is associated with several biomarkers, which
constitute potential targets for research into improving the prognostic power of 
HPV in OPSCC. Larger trials are needed, with standardization of cut-points and
adherence to consensus reporting guidelines.
