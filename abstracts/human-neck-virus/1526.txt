Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are responsible for the development of almost all
cervical cancers. HPV is also found in 85% of anal cancer and in 50% of penile,
vulvar, and vaginal cancers, and they are increasingly found in a subset of head 
and neck cancers, i.e., oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). The model
for how HPV causes cancer is derived from several decades of study on cervical
cancer, and it is just presumed that this model is not only completely valid for 
cervical cancer but for all other HPV-driven cancers as well. Next-generation
sequencing (NGS) has now provided the necessary tools to characterize genomic
alterations in cancer cells and can precisely determine the physical status of
HPV in those cells as well. We discuss recent discoveries from different
applications of NGS in both cervical cancer and OPSCCs, including whole-genome
sequencing and mate-pair NGS. We also discuss what NGS studies have revealed
about the different ways that HPV can be involved in cancer formation,
specifically comparing cervical cancer and OPSCC.
