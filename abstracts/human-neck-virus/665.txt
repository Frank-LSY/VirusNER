The results of this study indicate the reactive nature of H&N-KD (or a subset of H&N-KD), and it is unlikely that HHV-8 and EBV play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesion. However, the patients in this series did not have previous history of trauma or chronic irritation; thus, a neoplastic origin could not be excluded. Further multicentre studies based on more specimens are warranted.
