BACKGROUND/AIM: Prognostic impact of p16 expression in patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing surgery is not fully
examined. The aim of this study was to clarify these issues.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four OSCC subjects were analyzed.
Immuno-histochemical staining of p16, a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus
(HPV), was performed histopathologically. Data were retrospectively analyzed
according to p16 positivity and factors linked to prognosis were also analyzed.
RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the prognosis between the
p16-positive group (n=28) and the p16-negative group (n=36). In patients
undergoing post-operative radiation, the p16-positive group (n=18) had a
significantly better prognosis than the p16-negative group (n=6). On multivariate
analysis, transoral surgery was a significant predictor of overall survival
(p=0.0173).
CONCLUSION: Prognostic impact of p16 can be emphasized in a subgroup of OSCC
patients undergoing surgery. Surgery with sufficient surgical margin may be
chosen as the first treatment for HPV-negative OSCC in some cases.
