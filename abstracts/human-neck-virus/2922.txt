1. De novo malignancy is one of the leading causes of late mortality after liver 
transplantation. 2. The risks of skin cancers and lymphoma are more than 10-fold 
greater than the risks in an age-matched and sex-matched general population. 3.
Some types of neoplasia, such as lung, head and neck, and colorectal cancer, are 
more frequent in liver transplant recipients than in an age-matched and
sex-matched population. The risks of other frequent malignancies, such as
prostate and breast cancer, do not seem to be increased. 4. The most important
risks for posttransplant malignancy are Epstein-Barr virus seronegativity (for
lymphoma), sun exposure (for skin cancer), smoking, and increasing age. 5.
Despite the absence of evidence, general recommendations (such as avoidance of
overimmunosuppression, sunlight protection, and cessation of smoking) should be
given. Screening protocols may help to detect neoplasia at an early stage of
disease.
