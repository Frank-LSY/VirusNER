Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Existing therapies for advanced tumors have high failure rates and can have severe consequences in terms of pain, disfigurement, and poor speech and swallowing function. New treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients suffering with this disease and oncolytic viruses represent a promising approach.
