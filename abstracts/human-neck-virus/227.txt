Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small double-stranded DNA viruses that are
associated with greater than 95% of cervical cancers and 20% of head and neck
cancers. These cancers arise from persistent infections in which there is
continued expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes, often as a consequence of
integration of HPV DNA into the host genome. Such cancers represent "dead ends"
for the virus as integration disrupts the viral genome and because the cancers
are defective in normal epithelial differentiation, which is required for
production of progeny papillomavirus. In order to study the full viral life
cycle, from the establishment to maintenance to productive stages, our lab makes 
use of the organotypic epithelial tissue culture system. This system allows us to
mimic the three-dimensional structure of epithelia whose differentiation is
tightly linked to the completion of the HPV viral life cycle. In this chapter we 
describe how various aspects of the HPV life cycle are monitored in raft cultures
making use of an immortalized keratinocyte cell line. © 2016 by John Wiley &
