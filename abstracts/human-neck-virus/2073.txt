Outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer are determined by their tumor
characteristics and associated demographics. The role of human papilloma
virus-related disease for prognosis and outcomes with chemoradiotherapy is being

and the importance of optimizing radiation quality and minimizing toxicity is the
focus of ongoing studies.
