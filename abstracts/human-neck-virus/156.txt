Mycobacterial infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals worldwide. Cervical lymph nodes are the most frequently affected extrapulmonary sites. Despite the substantial reduction in complications of HIV-tuberculosis coinfection, a proportion of individuals develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a term used for a clinical deterioration following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objective of this study was to describe mycobacterial-associated IRIS in cervical lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals receiving ART.
