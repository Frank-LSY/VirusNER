There is increasing evidence worldwide that human papillomavirus is a major risk 
factor for head and neck cancer. Only few studies on this association have been
performed in Germany to date. For the purposes of the present study, tumor
specimens from 223 patients with squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity,
oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were analyzed for HPV DNA and p16INK4a
expression. The prevalence of HPV genotype 16 (HPV16) DNA in the study population
was 17.5%. Further high-risk HPV types were not detected. All HPV16-positive
tumors showed intense p16INK4a expression. HPV16 prevalence was highest in
tonsillar carcinoma (37.5%) and lowest in laryngeal cancer (2.8%). We observed a 
significantly higher incidence of cervical lymph node metastases in patients with
HPV16-positive tonsillar carcinoma in comparison to HPV-negative tumors (p <
0.016). Tobacco and/or alcohol consumption was significantly lower in patients
with HPV-positive tumors (p < 0.0001).
