Sixty-three patients were included; 23 (37%) had HPV DNA/p16+ samples and 40 (63%) were negative for either/both markers. A high proportion of patients had a history of tobacco smoking; significantly fewer patients with HPV+/p16+ samples were smokers than those who were negative for either/both markers (61% vs. 90%, respectively; p = 0.0067). There were no statistically significant differences between overall or recurrence-free survival in HPV+/p16+ patients vs. those negative for either/both markers. Overall survival appeared to be superior in patients with <10 pack-years smoking history and HPV+/p16+ disease.
