BACKGROUND: Psychosocial functioning is associated with vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in various patient populations. This study examined whether 
psychosocial functioning in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is associated with tumor VEGF expression, a protein that stimulates
angiogenesis and is associated with poor prognosis.
METHODS: Forty-two newly diagnosed patients completed assessments of psychosocial
functioning (ie, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, anxiety, social support) 
before surgery. Tumor samples were obtained for VEGF analysis and human
papillomavirus (HPV)-typing.
RESULTS: Poorer psychosocial functioning was associated with greater VEGF
expression controlling for disease stage (odds ratio [OR], 4.55; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.72-12.0; p < .01). When examined by HPV status, the association 
between psychosocial functioning and VEGF remained significant among patients who
were HPV negative (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 1.68-17.3; p < .01), but not among patients 
who were HPV positive.
CONCLUSION: These findings inform our understanding of the biobehavioral pathways
that may contribute to poor outcomes in non-HPV-associated HNSCCs.
