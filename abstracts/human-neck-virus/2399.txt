BACKGROUND: The utility of cancer databases for oropharyngeal cancer studies is
limited by lack of information on human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The purpose 
of this study was to develop a surrogate that can be used to adjust for the
effect of HPV status on survival.
METHODS: The study cohort included 6419 patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2012, identified in the National Cancer 
Database (NCDB). The HPV surrogate score was developed using a logistic
regression model predicting HPV-positive status.
RESULTS: The HPV surrogate score was predictive of HPV status (area under the
curve [AUC] 0.73; accuracy of 70.4%). Similar to HPV-positive tumors, HPV
surrogate positive tumors were associated with improved overall survival (OS;
hazard ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; P = .005), after 
adjusting for important covariates.
CONCLUSION: The HPV surrogate score is useful for adjusting for the effect of HPV
status on survival in studies utilizing cancer databases.
