The differential diagnosis in pediatric lymphadenopathy includes bacterial,
viral, fungal, and idiopathic causes. A systematic approach to patient evaluation
is necessary because the differential diagnosis, presentation, and work up must
consider infectious, immunologic, neoplastic, and idiopathic disorders. A
thorough history and examination are vital to determining the diagnosis and
ruling out a malignant process.
