BACKGROUND: As a distinctive type of head and neck cancers, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) is genesis from the clonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells accumulated with multiple genetic lesions. Among 
the recurrent genetic alterations defined, loss of 9p21.3 is the most frequent
early event in the tumorigenesis of EBV-associated NPC. In addition to the
reported CDKN2A/p16, herein, we elucidated the role of a miRNA, miR-31 within
this 9p21.3 region as NPC-associated tumor suppressor.
METHODS: The expression and promoter methylation of miR-31 were assessed in a
panel of NPC tumor lines and primary tumors. Its in vitro and in vivo tumor
suppression function was investigated through the ectopic expression of miR-31 in
NPC cells. We also determined the miR-31 targeted genes and its involvement in
the growth in NPC.
RESULTS: Downregulation of miR-31 expression was detected in almost all NPC cell 
line, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and primary tumors. Both homozygous
deletion and promoter hypermethylation were shown to be major mechanisms for
miR-31 silencing in this cancer. Strikingly, loss of miR-31 was also obviously
observed in the dysplastic lesions of nasopharynx. Restoration of miR-31 in
C666-1 cells inhibited the cell proliferation, colony-forming and migratory
capacities. Dramatic reduction of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and in
vivo tumorigenic potential were demonstrated in the stable clones expressing
miR-31. Furthermore, we proved that miR-31 suppressed the NPC cell growth via
targeting FIH1 and MCM2.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide strong evidence to support miR-31 as a new
NPC-associated tumor suppressor on 9p21.3 region. The inactivation of miR-31 may 
contribute to the early development of NPC.
