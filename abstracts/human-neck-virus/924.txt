BACKGROUND: Several recent studies have shown that incidence of oropharyngeal
carcinomas is rising in the Western World. This increase has been attributed to
changes in the etiology of oropharyngeal carcinomas with a growing role for
infections with Human Papilloma viruses. This nationwide study evaluates and
compares trends in incidence, clinical behavior and tumor characteristics of
oropharyngeal and oral squamous cell cancer.
METHODS: This study comprised all 16,480 patients with primary squamous cell
carcinoma of the oral tongue (OTSCC), oral cavity excluding oral tongue (OCSCC), 
and oropharynx (OPSCC) diagnosed from 1989 through 2008 in The Netherlands. We
assessed trends in age-standardized incidence, second cancer risk and subsite
specific relative survival (RS) over time.
RESULTS: Incidence of OTSCC and OPSCC in males and incidence of all subsites in
females increased significantly from 1989 through 2008. In males increases in
incidence were largely restricted to the 50-64 year age group (estimated annual
percentage change 2.2% and 3.2% for OTSCC and OPSCC, respectively), while in
females incidence increased for most age groups. The incidence of OCSCC (excl.
oral tongue) and OPSCC before 50 years of age decreased. Patients with OPSCC
showed the poorest prognosis with a relative survival of 41.6% after 5 years and 
29.4% after 10 years (P<0.001) over the entire period 1989-2008. However survival
increased substantially for OPSCC patients over time (5-year RS of 37.2% in
1989-1993 to 47.6% in 2004-2008, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Although incidence of OPSCC did increase since 1989, especially in
females, similar increases were seen for OCSCC (excl. oral tongue) and OTSCC. Our
study does not appear to support that HPV is the main contributor to a rising
incidence of OPSCC as the effects of changes in smoking and alcohol use cannot be
discounted.
