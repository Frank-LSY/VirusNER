OBJECTIVE: A standardized assay to determine the HPV status of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) specimens has not yet been established,
particularly for cytologic samples. The goal of this study was to determine
whether the hybrid capture-2 (HC-2) assay, already widely used for the detection 
of high risk HPV in cervical brushings, is applicable to cytologic specimens
obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fine needle aspirates (FNA) of cervical lymph nodes were
pre-operatively obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs and evaluated for
the presence of HPV using the HC-2 assay. HPV analysis was performed on the
corresponding resected tissue specimens using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
HR-HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). A cost analysis was performed using the
Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
RESULTS: HPV status of the cervical lymph node metastases was correctly
classified using the HC-2 assay in 84% (21/25) of cases. Accuracy was improved to
100% when cytologic evaluation confirmed the presence of cancer cells in the test
samples. The estimated cost savings to CMS using the HC-2 assay ranged from
$113.74 to $364.63 per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: HC-2 is a reliable method for determining the HPV status of HNSCCs. 
Its application to HNSCCs may reduce costs by helping to localize the primary
site during the diagnostic work-up as well as decrease the interval time of
determining the HPV status which would be relevant for providing prognostic
information to the patient as well as determining eligibility for clinical trials
targeting this unique patient population.
