OBJECTIVE: We studied changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover
after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the
contribution of zidovudine/lamivudine (ZDV/3TC) in particular.
DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial comparing lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) + ZDV/3TC 
with LPV/r + nevirapine (NVP) in 50 cART-naive men.
METHODS: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed
tomography scans (QCT) were performed at baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months after 
cART initiation. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH),
osteocalcin, and urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD)/creatinine ratio were measured.
RESULTS: BMD decreased rapidly in both femoral neck and lumbar spine after cART
initiation. BMD loss during 24 months measured by DXA, but not by QCT, was
greater in the ZDV/3TC/LPV/r group compared to the NVP/LPV/r group [femoral neck:
-6.3% +/- 1.0% (P < 0.0001) compared to -2.3% +/- 0.9% (P = 0.01), between-group 
P = 0.0006); lumbar spine: -5.1% +/- 0.8% (P < 0.0001) compared to -2.6% +/- 0.7%
(P = 0.0006), between-group P = 0.07]. Osteocalcin [+1.60 +/- 0.32 (P < 0.0001)
and +1.81 +/- 0.29 (P < 0.0001) nmol/l] and the urine DPD/creatinine ratio [+1.35
+/- 0.44 (P = 0.0029) and +1.19 +/- 0.38 nmol/mmol (P = 0.0024)] increased in
both groups over 24 months, with no significant difference between groups. PTH
increased to a greater degree in the NVP/LPV/r group [+2.0 +/- 0.31 pmol/l (P <
0.0001)] compared to [+0.81 +/- 0.33 pmol/l (P = 0.021) in the ZDV/3TC/LPV/r
group].
CONCLUSION: BMD in both femoral neck and lumbar spine decreased rapidly after
initiation of cART, in parallel to an increase in bone turnover. The greater bone
loss in the ZDV/3TC/LPV/r group compared to the NVP/LPV/r group suggests that
ZDV/3TC contributes to this process. The PTH increase does not explain this
greater bone loss.
