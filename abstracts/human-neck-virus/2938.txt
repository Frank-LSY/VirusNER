Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is rare in children, and it has a poor
prognosis compared with other types of lymphoma. We report the case of a
7-year-old boy with spontaneous improvement of PTCL complicated by hemophagocytic
syndrome as the initial symptom. He complained of pain and swelling of the right 
neck and presented with high fever. Pancytopenia, liver dysfunction, elevated
ferritin and soluble interleukin 2 receptor were noted on laboratory tests.
Peripheral blood plasma and white blood cells were positive for Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) genome but, after several days, the fever abated and laboratory data 
improved. On histopathology of lymph node biopsy, he was diagnosed as having PTCL
not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) with EBV infection. He received no
chemotherapy and was disease free at the last follow up, 6 years 8 months after
onset. This is probably the first case of spontaneous improvement in PTCL-NOS.
Careful treatment planning is therefore necessary in PTCL-NOS, given the
possibility of spontaneous improvement of symptoms.
