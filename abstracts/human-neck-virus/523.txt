Human papillomavirus (HPV) associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs), have become a serious global health problem. Despite decreases in
HPV-negative HNSCCs, the prevalence of HPV-positive HNSCCs has significantly
increased. HPV-positive cancers are associated with superior survival outcomes
when compared to HPV-negative cancers, which appears likely to be associated with
differences in the molecular pathogenesis of the two diseases. While therapies
are still problematic, the current HPV vaccine programs hold a promise for the
primary prevention of HPV-related HNSCCs and since Australia was the first to
introduce a nationwide HPV vaccine program, it is in a unique position to observe
the effects of the vaccine on HNSCCs. This review discusses the epidemiological
trends associated with HPV in HNSCC, with reference to the differences between
HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCCs and the prevention potential of HPV
vaccines.
