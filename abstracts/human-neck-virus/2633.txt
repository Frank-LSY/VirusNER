The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of 12 weeks of non-linear
resistance training (NLRT) on anthropometry, muscle strength and inflammatory
biomarkers in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (PIHIV). Thirty 
previously sedentary PIHIVs were randomized into the NLRT (n = 15) and control
(CON, n = 15) groups. NLRT group were submitted to 12 weeks of training, whereas 
the CON group maintained their daily habits. At baseline and after 12 weeks, both
groups underwent anthropometric evaluations and blood sampling for the analysis
of inflammatory biomarkers. Analysis of covariance using preintervention values
as covariate was performed to determine the effects of exercise on anthropometry,
muscle strength, cytokines levels and T cells. Significance was set at p < 0.05. 
After 12 weeks of intervention, there was a decrease in subcutaneous body fat
(p < .0001), neck, abdomen and waist circumferences (p < .05), waist-to-hip ratio
(p = .009), blood levels of interleukin (IL)-1β (p = .029), IL-6 (p = .005), IL-8
(p = .010), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α (p = .001) and an increase in
muscle strength (p < .0001), IL-10 levels (p = .030) and CD4(+) (p = .004) and
CD8(+) (p < .0001) counts in the NLRT compared to CON group. Twelve weeks of NLRT
promoted positive changes in the body fat, body circumferences, muscular strength
and inflammatory profile in PIHIV.
