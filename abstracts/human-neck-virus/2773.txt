A 67-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of left otalgia and a 1-day
history of odynophagia, pain extending into the face and neck, and a productive
cough. Flexible nasendoscopy showed features of supraglottitis, with swollen
arytenoids and pooling of saliva in the piriform fossae. Laboratory
investigations revealed a mildly raised C reactive protein. A CT scan of the neck
supported the diagnosis of supraglottitis and pharyngitis, with thickening of the
mucosa of the left piriform fossae and left oropharynx. Standard supraglottitis
treatment was instigated, but on day 4 of the admission, a vesicular rash and
features of cranial nerve involvement (V, VII, VIII, X) developed. A revised
diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome with cranial polyneuropathy was made and later 
confirmed by varicella zoster virus PCR. After 4 weeks, facial nerve function
normalised, but features of other cranial nerve palsies were persistent.
