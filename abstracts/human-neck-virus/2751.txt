OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize clinical, imaging, and sialendoscopy
findings in patients with chronic parotitis and multiple parotid calcifications.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Clinical history, radiographic images and reports, lab tests, and
operative reports were reviewed for adult patients with chronic parotitis and
multiple parotid calcifications who underwent parotid sialendoscopy.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 133 (10%) patients undergoing parotid sialendoscopy for
chronic sialadenitis had more than one calcification in the region of the parotid
gland. Seven patients (54%) were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease from
autoimmune parotitis (positive Sjögren's antibodies or antinuclear antibodies) or
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. The six patients (46%) who did not
have an immune-mediated disorder had most calcifications located anterior or
along the masseter muscle. Eight of 13 patients (61%) had at least one calculus
found in the parotid duct on sialendoscopy. Four patients (38%) had multiple
punctate calcifications within the parotid gland, all of whom had either
autoimmune parotitis or HIV. None of the proximal or punctate parotid
calcifications posterior to the masseter were visualized on sialendoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic parotitis in conjunction with multiple parotid
calcifications is uncommon and was identified in 10% of our cohort. We contrast
two classifications of parotid calcifications: 1) intraductal stones that cause
recurrent duct obstruction and are often located within the main parotid duct
along or anterior to the masseter and 2) punctate intraparenchymal parotid gland 
calcifications that are not visualized on sialendoscopy and may represent
underlying inflammatory disease.
