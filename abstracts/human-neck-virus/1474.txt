BACKGROUND: HPV is important in a subset of HNSCC. Our meta-analysis determined
the clinical characteristics of HPV-related HNSCC.
METHOD: Pubmed search terms "HPV" and "HNSCC" were used to identify 34 studies
since 1980. We obtained pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR)
using random or fixed-effects model and compared OS depicted in forest plot.
RESULTS: A total of 5681 patients were included. The prevalence of HPV+ tumors
was 22%, with 86.7% of HPV16+ genotype. The OR for HNSCC in HPV16+ patients was
4.44 (95% CI = 2.87-6.02). HPV status was associated with p16 expression (adj OR 
= 3.00; 0.90-9.70), and HPV+ tumors were less likely to harbor p53 mutations (adj
OR = 0.21; 0.04-0.38). The HR for death in HPV+ patients was 0.42 (0.27-0.57).
HPV+ HNSCC also had a better response to therapy.
CONCLUSION: HPV+ HNSCC are established as a separate biologic entity. Prospective
trials are needed to establish the optimal therapy for HPV+ HNSCC.
