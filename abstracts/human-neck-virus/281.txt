Infection with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections and can lead to development of head and neck, skin, and
anogenital cancer, including cervical cancer, which represents one of the world's
most significant health problems. In this study, we analyze G-rich regions in all
known HPV genomes in order to evaluate their potential to fold into G-quadruplex 
structure. Interestingly, G-rich loci fulfilling the criteria for G-quadruplex
formation were found in only 8 types of HPV. Nevertheless, viral G-quadruplexes
in 7 sequences derived directly from HPVs are confirmed here for the first time. 
G-rich regions with the capacity to form G-quadruplexes are located in the LCR,
L2, E1, and E4 regions of the HPV genome; therefore we assume that regulation
processes in viruses could be affected by G-quadruplex formation. Our results
represent a starting point for the design of specific ligands with viral
G-quadruplex motifs and suggest novel methods for the control of viral
replication and transcription.
