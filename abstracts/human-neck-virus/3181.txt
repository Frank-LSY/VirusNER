OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of children who present to an
emergency department (ED) with facial palsy and determine the association of
outcome with etiology, degree of initial paralysis, and ED management.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children who presented to an ED
with facial nerve paralysis (FNP).
RESULTS: There were 85 patients with a mean age of 8.0 (SD, 6.1) years; 60% (n = 
51) of the patients were male, and 65.9% (n = 56) were admitted to the hospital. 
Bell palsy (50.6%) was the most common etiology followed by infectious (22.4%),
traumatic (16.5%), congenital (7.1%), and neoplastic etiologies (3.5%). Patients 
with Bell palsy had shorter recovery times (P = 0.049), and traumatic cases
required a longer time for recovery (P = 0.016). Acute otitis media (AOM)-related
pediatric FNP had shorter recovery times than non-AOM-related cases (P = 0.005)
in infectious group. Patients given steroid therapy did not have a shorter
recovery time (P = 0.237) or a better recovery (P = 0.269). There was no
difference in recovery rate of pediatric patients with Bell palsy between
hospitalization or not (P = 0.952).
CONCLUSION: Bell palsy, infection, and trauma were most common etiologies of
pediatric FNP. Recovery times were shorter in pediatric patients with Bell palsy 
and AOM-related FNP, whereas recovery took longer in traumatic cases. Steroid
therapy did not seem beneficial for pediatric FNP. Hospitalization is not
indicated for pediatric patients with Bell palsy.
