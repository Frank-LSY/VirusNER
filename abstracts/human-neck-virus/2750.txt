BACKGROUND: The adducin (ADD) family proteins, namely ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3, are
actin-binding proteins that play important roles in the stabilization of membrane
cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions. All the ADD proteins contain a highly
conserved bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the carboxyl termini,
but only ADD1 can localize to the nucleus. The reason for this discrepancy is not
clear.
METHODS: To avoid the potential effect of cell-cell junctions on the distribution
of ADD proteins, HA epitope-tagged ADD proteins and mutants were transiently
expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and their distribution in the cytoplasm and
nucleus was examined by immunofluorescence staining. Several nuclear proteins
were identified to interact with ADD1 by mass spectrometry, which were further
verified by co-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: In this study, we found that ADD1 was detectable both in the cytoplasm
and nucleus, whereas ADD2 and ADD3 were detected only in the cytoplasm. However, 
ADD2 and ADD3 were partially (~40%) sequestered in the nucleus by leptomycin B, a
CRM1/exportin1 inhibitor. Upon the removal of leptomycin B, ADD2 and ADD3
re-distributed to the cytoplasm. These results indicate that ADD2 and ADD3
possess functional NLS and are quickly transported to the cytoplasm upon entering
the nucleus. Indeed, we found that ADD2 and ADD3 possess much higher potential to
counteract the activity of the NLS derived from Simian virus 40 large T-antigen
than ADD1. All the ADD proteins appear to contain multiple nuclear export signals
mainly in their head and neck domains. However, except for the leucine-rich motif
(377FEALMRMLDWLGYRT391) in the neck domain of ADD1, no other classic nuclear
export signal was identified in the ADD proteins. In addition, the nuclear
retention of ADD1 facilitates its interaction with RNA polymerase II and
zinc-finger protein 331.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ADD2 and ADD3 possess functional NLS and
shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The discrepancy in the subcellular
localization of the ADD isoforms arises due to their different nuclear export
capabilities. In addition, the interaction of ADD1 with RNA polymerase II and
zinc-finger protein 331 implicates a potential role for ADD1 in the regulation of
transcription.
