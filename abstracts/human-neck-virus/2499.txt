BACKGROUND: In recent years, new immunotherapeutic drugs have become available:
the so-called immune checkpoint modulators. With these drugs, unprecedented
treatment results have been achieved in different malignant diseases; primarily
malignant melanoma, but also in various other malignomas. These achievements have
revolutionized the oncologic treatment landscape. This quickly expanding research
field, driven by revolutionary treatment results, has put immunotherapy in the
focus of attention.
OBJECTIVE: Due to rapid developments in the field of immunotherapy, this article 
aims at introducing, illustrating, and summarizing the field of modern
immunotherapy, based on recently presented clinical data from the Annual Meeting 
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The most important ASCO Meeting 2015 immunotherapy trials 
for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were identified, summarized,
and discussed with respect to the current state of research.
RESULTS: The oncologic landscape of clinical trials is currently dominated by the
new immune checkpoint modulating drugs. Also for HNSCC, a variety of clinical
trials and substances are under way. The current primary focus of these trials is
targeting and inhibiting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis. Cancer immunotherapy
with immune checkpoint modulating drugs seems to be independent of human
papilloma virus (HPV) status. Robust predictive markers for patient selection are
not yet available.
CONCLUSION: Current data from clinical trials with immune checkpoint modulators
are promising. In the coming years, integration of these drugs into clinical
routine can be expected. With regard to the public health economic burden and
potential adverse events, the identification of predictive markers for patient
selection is a major task for future trials.
