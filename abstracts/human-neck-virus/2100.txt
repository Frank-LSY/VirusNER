OBJECTIVES: The role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression in human head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still poorly understood. In this study,
we aimed at establishing the onco-lncRNAome profiling of HNSCC and to identify
lncRNAs correlating with prognosis and patient survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Atlas of Noncoding RNAs in Cancer (TANRIC) database
was employed to retrieve the lncRNA expression information generated from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC RNA-sequencing data. RNA-sequencing data from
HNSCC cell lines were also considered for this study. Bioinformatics approaches, 
such as differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, principal
component analysis, and Co-LncRNA enrichment analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Using TCGA HNSCC RNA-sequencing data from 426 HNSCC and 42 adjacent
normal tissues, we found 728 lncRNA transcripts significantly and differentially 
expressed in HNSCC. Among the 728 lncRNAs, 55 lncRNAs were significantly
associated with poor prognosis, such as overall survival and/or disease-free
survival. Next, we found 140 lncRNA transcripts significantly and differentially 
expressed between Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive tumors and HPV negative
tumors. Thirty lncRNA transcripts were differentially expressed between TP53
mutated and TP53 wild type tumors. Co-LncRNA analysis suggested that
protein-coding genes that are co-expressed with these deregulated lncRNAs might
be involved in cancer associated molecular events. With consideration of
differential expression of lncRNAs in a HNSCC cell lines panel (n=22), we found
several lncRNAs that may represent potential targets for diagnosis, therapy and
prevention of HNSCC.
CONCLUSION: LncRNAs profiling could provide novel insights into the potential
mechanisms of HNSCC oncogenesis.
