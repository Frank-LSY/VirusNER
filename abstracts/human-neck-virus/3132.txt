PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review is timely and relevant because rhinosinusitis is a
disease process that is heterogeneous in its clinical and pathologic
manifestations. Therefore, no one causative factor has been identified that fully
accounts for all rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this review is to provide a
succinct update of rhinosinusitis classification, pathophysiology, and management
given the new movement toward evidence-based guidelines.
RECENT FINDINGS: The term rhinosinusitis reflects the concurrent inflammatory and
infectious processes that affect the nasal passages and the contiguous paranasal 
sinuses. The most recent classification scheme is intended primarily to guide
clinical research and divides rhinosinusitis into four categories: acute
bacterial rhinosinusitis, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis, chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. The
goals of treatment include reduction of mucosal edema, reestablishment of sinus
ventilation, and eradication of infecting pathogens. Multiple therapies are
available for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis, including antibiotics,
hypertonic and isotonic saline irrigations or sprays, topical and systemic
glucocorticords, antileukotriene agents, and endoscopic sinus surgery.
SUMMARY: Rhinosinusitis is a common medical problem that interferes with patient 
quality of life and loss of work productivity. Because of the heterogeneity that 
underlies its pathology, no one treatment regimen exists for the management of
rhinosinusitis.
