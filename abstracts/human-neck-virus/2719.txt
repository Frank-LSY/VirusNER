PURPOSE: Promoter hypermethylation is a well-documented mechanism for
tumor-specific alteration of suppressor gene activity in human malignancy
including head and neck cancer (HNC). The abrogation of specific suppressor gene 
activity may influence tumor behavior and clinical outcome. In this study we
examined methylation of DCC, KIF1A, EDNRB, and p16(INK4a) in a large cohort of
HNC patients from Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) 4393/Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RTOG) 9614 to identify clinical correlates of methylation of
these genes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Methylation was assessed by quantitative
methylation-specific PCR in DNA from tumor specimens and was considered as a
continuous and a binary variable. Clinical data including demographics, stage,
risk factor exposure, treatment, and outcome were collected by ECOG and RTOG.
Methylation status was also correlated with mutation of TP53 (previously
reported) and human papilloma virus status.
RESULTS: Methylation results were available for 368 cases, 353 of which also have
p53 mutation status. At least one methylation event was present in all tumors. In
multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, methylation of p16 was associated
with decreased survival (HR = 1.008; P = 0.045). However, in tumors with
disruptive TP53 mutation (poor prognostic group), the additional presence of
methylation of p16 was protective (P = 0.019 considering p16 methylation as a
continuous variable).
CONCLUSION: Methylation of tumor-related genes contributes to the biological
behavior of HNC and influences overall survival in conjunction with other known
prognostic molecular events.
