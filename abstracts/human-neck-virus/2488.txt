BACKGROUND: Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare fungal infection and most
documented cases are in immune-compromised individuals such as those with
acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in an adolescent
girl.
METHOD: We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 13-year-old
adolescent girl. She was admitted for 16 days because of neck masses of 3 years
duration, generalized body swelling of 3 months and reduction in urinary output
of 2 months. She tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies.
RESULT: An autopsy was performed because a definitive diagnosis could not be made
while the patient was still alive. The autopsy revealed central caseating areas
in the lymph nodes and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The periodic
acid-Schiff staining technique for tissues showed viable yeast cells suggestive
of histoplasmosis. Zeihl-Neelsen's staining for mycobacteria tuberculosis was
negative.
CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed case of disseminated histoplasmosis while the patient was
alive is being reported in a 13-year-old girl. Disseminated histoplasmosis should
be considered as a differential diagnosis of childhood chronic infections and
malignancies as in Nigeria.
