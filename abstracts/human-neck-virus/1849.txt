OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to compare oncologic and functional
outcomes of p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients, 
in the presence and absence of planned radiation to the primary bed following
transoral surgery (TOS), stratified by T-classification.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 261, T1-T4, consecutively TOS-treated
OPSCC patients.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 61months, local recurrence (LR) occurred in 6
(2.3%)patients (3 each in T1-T2 and T3-T4 groups), of which 5 had tumors in the
tongue base and one in the tonsil. Of patients not receiving planned primary bed 
radiation, LR occurred in 3% of T1-T2s versus 17% of T3-T4s. In patients with
T1-T2 tumors, Absolute Risk Reduction of LR with primary bed radiation was 3.26% 
(95% CI: -0.37%, 7%); Number Needed to Treat to prevent one LR was 31 (95% CI:
14.5, 271). Absolute Risk Increase for gastrostomy-tube with primary bed
radiation was 34.4% (95% CI: 24%, 45%); Number Needed to Harm was 3 (95% CI: 2.2,
4.2), i.e., for every three patients with T1-T2 tumors receiving primary bed
radiation, one had a gastrostomy-tube.
CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of primary bed radiation in margin-negative resected,
T1-T2 p16-positive OPSCC was not associated with significant compromise of local 
control, and correlated with superior swallowing preservation, assessed using
gastrostomy rate as a surrogate. Lack of primary bed radiation in T3-T4 tumors
associated with significantly increased LR rates.
