Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a disease with significant
morbidity and mortality. The advancement of next-generation sequencing
technologies now enables the landscape of genetic alterations in HNSCCs to be
deciphered. In this review, we describe the mutation spectrum discovered in
HNSCCs, especially human papilloma virus-associated and/or tobacco smoke
exposure-associated HNSCCs. We also describe related research from two
independent investigators and from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Emphasis is placed on
the therapeutic implications of genes frequently altered in HNSCCs (i.e., TP53,
PIK3CA, and NOTCH1) and their corresponding pathways, with a particular focus on 
recent findings of Notch signaling pathway activation in HNSCC. We also discuss
the application of integrated genomic pathway-based analysis for precision cancer
therapy in HNSCC.
