CONCLUSION: Both the regularly used heat and moisture exchanger (R-HME) and the
HME with both an antimicrobial and hygroscopic element (F-HME) are effective
moisture exchangers. The antimicrobial filter of the F-HME acts as a heat
exchanger. The external features of the F-HME were experienced as inconvenient,
but decreased sputum production was reported as well.
OBJECTIVES: Recently an HME with an integrated antimicrobial filter has become
available for use in laryngectomized patients. The purpose of this study was to
assess its short-term endotracheal climate changes and feasibility in daily
practice.
METHODS: Endotracheal temperature and humidity were successfully measured in 13
laryngectomized patients (2652 analysed full breaths), during 10 min
rest-breathing with the R-HME, with an F-HME and without HME in a randomized
sequence. Additionally, a 3 week prospective clinical feasibility trial was
conducted in 17 laryngectomized patients.
RESULTS: Both R-HME and F-HME increase endotracheal minimum humidity values (5.8 
and 4.7 mgH(2)O/L, respectively; p < 0.0001). Compared with open stoma breathing,
in contrast to the R-HME, the F-HME increases both end-inspiratory and
end-expiratory temperature values (1.1 degrees C, and 0.6 degrees C,
respectively). After the 3-week clinical feasibility trial, one patient dropped
out; 11 patients (11/16 = 69%) disliked the larger design of the F-HME and all
patients reported less optimal airtight occlusion. Five patients (5/16 = 31%)
reported remarkably decreased sputum production.
