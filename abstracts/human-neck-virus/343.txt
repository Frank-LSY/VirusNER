Compared with HPV negative cases (n=22), significantly more HPV positive cases (n=25) presented initially with cervical metastasis (27% vs 56% respectively; p=0Â·047). The HPV PCR assay on FNAC material showed a high sensitivity (96%; 95% CI 86.6-97.4) and specificity (100%; 95% CI 85.1-96.7) using the reference standard of HPV PCR analysis on FFPE material of the same patients.
