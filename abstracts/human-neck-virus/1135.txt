The current study aimed to investigate the incidence and survival patterns of
HNSCCs arising from different anatomic sites, potentially related (the
oropharynx) or unrelated (the oral cavity, the larynx/hypopharynx) to HPV, to
provide clues on possible growing impact of HPV in the epidemiology of HNSCC in
Italy. Epidemiological data were retrieved from ten long-term Cancer Registries
covering a population of 7.8 million inhabitants. Trends were described by means 
of the estimated annual percent change (APC) stratified by age and gender, and
compared between HPV-related and HPV-unrelated anatomical sites. The data
regarding 28,295 HNSCCs diagnosed in Italy between 1988 and 2012 were analyzed.
In males, the incidence rate (IR) of cancers arising from sites unrelated to HPV 
infection significantly decreased in all age groups (APC:-3.31 for
larynx/hypopharynx; APC:-1.77 for oral cavity), whereas stable IR were observed
for cancers arising from sites related to HPV infection. In females, IR for
cancers from HPV-related sites increased significantly over the observed period; 
the largest increment was noted in those over 60 (APC:2.92%) who also showed a
significantly lower number of HNSCCs from the larynx/hypopharynx (APC:- 0.84) and
a significantly higher number of oral cavity tumors (APC = 2.15). The five-year
relative survival remained largely unchanged in the patients with
laryngeal/hypopharyngeal SCC and, conversely, significantly improved in the
patients with SCC at HPV-related sites. The trends observed suggest a potential
increasing impact of HPV infection on the epidemiology of HNSCC in Italy, but to 
a lesser extent and with a different pattern from that observed in other Western 
countries.
