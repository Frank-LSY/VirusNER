CONCLUSION: The lack of human papilloma virus (HPV) sequences as well as
potential HPV-activated cells such as cells that would be p16- and Ki-67 positive
does not support a role of HPV in the pathogenesis of this lesion.
OBJECTIVE: The exact etiopathogenesis of Warthin's tumor of the parotid gland is 
still unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if HPV could play a
role in the development of this parotid lesion.
METHODS: Tissue samples from 40 Warthin's tumors of the parotid gland were
investigated by PCR followed by in situ hybridization. The immunohistochemical
expression of p16 and the dual immunostaining of p16 and Ki-67 were evaluated in 
all samples.
RESULTS: Strong and diffuse p16 immunoreactivity was found in 7 of the 40 cases
(17.5%). In situ hybridization showed a diffuse episomal signal in those samples.
However, PCR could not reliably detect the presence of HPV genes. Furthermore,
p16-expressing epithelial cells were mostly negative for the proliferation marker
Ki-67.
