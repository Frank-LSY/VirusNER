OBJECTIVE: (1) Obtain matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) expression profiles for head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) specimens from the Cancer Genomic Atlas 
(TCGA). (2) Demonstrate HNSCC imaging using MMP-cleavable, fluorescently labeled 
ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptide (RACPP).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective human cohort study; prospective animal study.
SETTING: Translational research laboratory.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patient clinical data and mRNA expression levels of MMP
genes were downloaded from TCGA data portal. RACPP provides complementary
ratiometric fluorescent contrast (increased Cy5 and decreased Cy7 intensities)
when cleaved by MMP2/9. HNSCC-tumor bearing mice were imaged in vivo after RACPP 
injection. Histology was evaluated by a pathologist blinded to experimental
conditions. Zymography confirmed MMP-2/9 activity in xenografts. RACPP was
applied to homogenized human HNSCC specimens, and ratiometric fluorescent signal 
was measured on a microplate reader for ex vivo analysis.
RESULTS: Expression of multiple MMPs including MMP2/9 is greater in patient HNSCC
tumors than matched control tissue. In patients with human papilloma virus
positive (HPV+) tumors, higher MMP2 and MMP14 expression correlates with worse
5-year survival. Orthotopic tongue HNSCC xenografts showed excellent ratiometric 
fluorescent labeling with MMP2/9-cleavable RACPP (sensitivity = 95.4%,
specificity = 95.0%). Fluorescence ratios were greater in areas of higher tumor
burden (P < .03), which is useful for intraoperative margin assessment. Ex vivo, 
human HNSCC specimens showed greater cleavage of RACPP when compared to control
tissue (P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: Human HNSCC tumors show increased mRNA expression of multiple MMPs
including MMP2/9. We used RACPP, a ratiometric fluorescence assay of MMP2/9
activity, to show improved occult tumor identification and margin clearance. Ex
vivo assays using RACPP in biopsy specimens may identify patients who will
benefit from intraoperative RACPP use.
