The C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), in
particular DC-SIGN and DCIR, likely play an important role in HIV-1 early
infection. Here, we systematically compared the capture and transfer capability
of DC-SIGN and DCIR using a wide range of HIV-1 isolates. Our results indicated
that DC-SIGN plays a stronger role than DCIR in DC-mediated HIV-1 capture and
transfer. This was further strengthened by the data from transient and stable
transfectants, showing that DC-SIGN had better capability, compared with DCIR in 
HIV-1 capture and transfer. Following constructing and analyzing a series of
soluble DC-SIGN and DCIR truncates and chimeras, we demonstrated that the neck
domain, but not the CRD, renders DC-SIGN higher binding affinity to gp120 likely 
via the formation of tetramerization. Our findings provide insights into
CLR-mediated HIV-1 capture and transfer, highlighting potential targets for
intervention strategies against gp120-CLR interactions.
