Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is a major health problem, and much 
effort is being made in the different settings of its presentation. Much of the
recent progress has been made in locoregionally advanced inoperable disease,
mainly with the optimal combination of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and with the 
introduction of new active drugs, such as docetaxel, in the induction phase of
the treatment. The association of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) 
regimen is now acknowledged as being the gold standard of induction treatment.
The subset of patients with recurrent/metastatic disease still carries a grim
prognosis. For the time being, new biological therapies have not dramatically
changed this scenario, even in combination with conventional treatments. Little
is known about the role of docetaxel and, in general, of chemotherapy in the
adjuvant setting, even though it is increasingly acknowledged that, beyond a
certain risk, concurrent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is required. The main aim of 
the research on head and neck cancer probably lies in the identification of
biomolecular markers that are able to predict clinical behaviour, thus allowing
appropriate treatment tailoring. The identification of human papilloma virus
infection as the agent of a particular form of oropharyngeal cancer is an example
of this strategy in consideration of the peculiar characteristics.
