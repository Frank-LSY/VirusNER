BACKGROUND: Viral upper respiratory tract infections occur frequently among
conscripts. Probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day
care. Limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the
nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses.
OBJECTIVES: To assess, whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal
occurrence of respiratory viruses in Finnish conscripts.
STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 90- and 150-day
intervention study, 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192
symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (46.9%)
or control tablet (53.1%) on visits to a garrison's health care center due to
symptoms of infection. The presence of respiratory viruses was tested by
PCR-methods, and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups.
RESULTS: 184 (76.9%) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one
respiratory virus. Picornaviruses were the most common viruses and were detected 
in 155 (84.2%) of samples. Of these, 143 (92.3%) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 
(12.9%) were enterovirus-positive. The control group had 83 (64%) and the
probiotic group 72 (66%) picornavirus infections (p=0.79). Monthly distribution
of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3
months in the probiotic group than in the control group (p=0.0069). However,
probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic
conscripts. However, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 
months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing
common cold. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms
involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses.
