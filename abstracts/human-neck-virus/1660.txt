PURPOSE: PET/CT with (68)Ga-labelled [DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTA-TOC
PET/CT) is a routinely used imaging modality for neuroendocrine tumours
expressing somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Recent studies have shown SSTR
expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, albeit lower than in highly 
differentiated neuroendocrine tumours. We sought to determine whether
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a rare
subtype of head and neck cancer, shows increased (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake
indicating expression of SSTR.
METHODS: Five patients with untreated, histologically proven EBV-positive NPC
were referred for (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT. Tracer uptake in tumour lesions was
assessed visually and semiquantitatively measuring maximum standardized uptake
values (SUVmax) and tumour to background ratios.
RESULTS: Increased tumour-specific uptake was detected in all five patients with 
a median SUVmax of 10.6 (range 3.6 - 17.1) in the primary tumour and 13.2 (range 
6.1 - 14.5) in cervical lymph node metastases.
CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT demonstrated tracer uptake in EBV-positive NPC
comparable to that in highly differentiated neuroendocrine tumours. This
observation is consistent with increased SSTR expression in EBV-positive NPC and 
may open new diagnostic and therapeutic windows in NPC.
