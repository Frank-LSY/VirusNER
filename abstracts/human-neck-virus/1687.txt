In 2003, a non-replicating adenoviral gene therapy product received the world`s
first government licence for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Two years
later approval was granted to a replication-selective adenovirus for the
treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in combination with chemotherapy. This
review introduces the reader to gene therapy as an emerging treatment modality,
and outlines its application to the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by
examining recent pre-clinical and clinical research.
