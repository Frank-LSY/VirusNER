OBJECTIVE: Historically, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been
earmarked a lymphatic malignancy. Recently, this has been called into question.
Our study aims to (1) illustrate the robust differences in distant metastases
between p16+ and p16- oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and (2)
provide support that p16+ OPSCC has a predilection toward vasculature invasion
and hematogenous spread.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional, case series with chart review.
SETTING: Four academic institutions.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Within a group of 1113 patients with primary OPSCC who
received treatment between 1979 and 2013, those who developed distant metastasis 
(DM) were divided into 2 cohorts based on p16 status. Intergroup and intragroup
univariate analysis was performed as well as descriptive analysis of end-organ
sites.
RESULTS: Of the 1058 patients included, 89 developed DM. Thirty were p16- and 59 
were p16+. Of the p16- patients with DM, only 10% had disseminated disease
(distant metastases at ≥2 sites) compared with 74% of p16+ patients. Distant
disease in p16+ patients included brain, abdomen, and a distinct pattern of
pulmonary metastases.
CONCLUSION: Our large, multi-institutional study supports published reports that 
p16+ OPSCC metastasizes with a unique phenotype that is hematogenous and widely
disseminated with atypical end-organ sites. Our data suggest that p16+ OPSCC has 
a predilection toward active vasculature invasion as evidenced by the results and
illustrative radiologic and pathohistologic examples. These findings may have
implications for future targeted therapy when treating p16+ OPSCC.
