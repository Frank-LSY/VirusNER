Human papillomavirus (HPV) activates E2F1-driven transcription via the E7-RB1-E2F
pathway. Genetic polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) targeted by
miRNAs can affect the regulation of target genes and individual cancer risk.
Thus, we hypothesized that a polymorphism at the 3'UTR miRNA binding site of E2F1
gene (rs3213180) was associated with risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) 
and tumor HPV status of oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). We determined
the E2F1rs3213180 polymorphism and HPV16 L1 serology of 325 OSCC patients and 335
controls, and tumor HPV16 status of 552 OPSCC. Logistic regression models were
used to calculate associations of E2F1rs3213180 polymorphism with risk of
HPV-associated OSCC and tumor HPV status of OPSCC. The risk of HPV-associated
OSCC was modified by the E2F1rs3213180 polymorphism. Patients with both HPV
seropositivity and the Ins/Del or Ins/Ins genotype of E2F1rs3213180 had the
highest risk of OSCC, while the lowest risk was detected in patients with HPV
seronegativity and the Del/Del genotype. A similar and more prominent effect was 
detected in OPSCC, but not in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC)
patients. Notably, that effect trend was pronounced in never-smokers and
never-drinkers. Furthermore, the patients with the E2F1rs3213180 Ins/Del or
Ins/Ins genotype were 2.9 times more likely to have HPV-positive tumors than
those with the Del/Del genotype. Our results suggest that the E2F1rs3213180
polymorphism may influence susceptibility to HPV-associated OSCC, particularly
for OPSCC, never-smokers and never-drinkers, but not for patients with OCSCC.
Additional larger population and functional studies are warranted to confirm our 
findings. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
