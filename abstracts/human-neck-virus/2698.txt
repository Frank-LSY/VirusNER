The association between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, female 
genital tract, and skin with human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes is well
established in the general population and in solid organ transplant recipients,
but no consistent link has been reported between HPV infection and SCC after
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Studies are needed to determine 
if SCC, the most common secondary malignancy after allo-SCT, which is linked to
chronic graft versus host disease and immunosuppressive therapy, is HPV related. 
Consideration should be given to assessing pretransplant HPV antibodies to
identify patients at risk for HPV reactivation. If a strong relationship between 
HPV and second malignancies after SCT exists, studies to evaluate the
immunogenicity and efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (subtypes 6, 11, 16, and 
18) should be considered in both male and female long-term survivors after
allo-SCT.
