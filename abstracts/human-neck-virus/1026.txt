The emerging evidence showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in
cell growth and apoptosis as well as cancer progression and metastasis of
malignant tumor, however, limited data are available on the role of lncRNAs in
human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCC). Here, we demonstrated that 23.98% of 196 HNSCC cases in Southwest China 
could be classified as HPV16 infection. The number of MDSCs in HPV-positive HNSCC
was significantly higher than normal control, indicating that HPV infection may
promote MDSCs aggregation. Then, we applied an array-based approach to monitor
the lncRNA expression between HPV-positive HNSCC, HPV-negative HNSCC and normal
oral mucous, and obtained 132 different lncRNAs in different HPV infected states 
of HNSCC. HOTAIR, PROM1, CCAT1, and MUC19 mRNA levels, determined by qRT-PCR were
inversely correlated with MDSCs collection of HPV-associated HNSCC in 2
independent patient cohorts. The results may provide a rationale for the further 
evaluation of lncRNAs as a molecular target to elucidate the molecular mechanism 
of HPV promoting MDSCs collection of HNSCC.
