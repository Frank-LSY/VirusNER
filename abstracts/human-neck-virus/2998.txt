Clinical and pathologic findings in extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) often
raise challenging problems in diagnosis. We demonstrate the first established
case of lymphoma with precursor natural killer (NK) cell origin in the oral and
maxillofacial region. An 81-year-old Japanese man had an enlarged facial mass
mainly in the parotid region but hyposensitivity in the affected side of the
mental and lingual region, and diagnostic imaging revealed the origin to be in
the masticator space and indicated an advanced-stage lymphoma. The tumor cell
immunophenotype was CD56(+)CD3(-)CD4(-), with no B-cell- or myeloid-associated
markers. The genotype was of the germ-line configuration of T-cell receptor
genes, and no association with Epstein-Barr virus was evident, leading to a
diagnosis of NK-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This report discusses diagnostic
challenges of NHL, including manifestation of numb chin syndrome as a clinical
indicator and immunophenotyping of NK-cell-lineage neoplasms.
