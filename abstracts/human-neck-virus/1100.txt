Transplant recipients frequently exhibit an increased Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
load in the peripheral blood. Here, we quantitated the EBV-infected cells in the 
peripheral blood of these patients and defined the mode of viral infection,
latent or lytic. These data indicated that there is no strong correlation between
the number of infected cells and the EBV load (EBVL). This can be explained by a 
highly variable number of EBV copies per infected cell and by lytic replication
in some cells. The plasma of these patients did not contain any free infectious
viruses, but contained nevertheless EBV DNA, sometimes in large amounts, that
probably originates from cell debris and contributed to the total EBVL. Some of
the investigated samples carried a highly variable number of infected cells in
active latency, characterized by an expression of the Epstein-Barr nuclear
antigens (EBNA2) protein. However, a third of the samples expressed neither EBNA2
nor lytic proteins. Patients with an increased EBVL represent a heterogeneous
group of patients whose infection cannot be characterized by this method alone.
Precise characterization of the origin of an increased EBVL, in particular, in
terms of the number of EBV-infected cells, requires additional investigations
including the number of EBV-encoded small RNA-positive cells.
