Oncolytic adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene therapy is a promising approach for suppression of primary tumors. Therapeutic efficacy of Ad-mediated gene therapy has been limited by immunogenicity, rapid dissemination of viral progenies into systemic circulation and short duration of biological activity. Polymeric sustained local delivery can overcome many of these challenges to produce a viable therapy with improved outcomes.
