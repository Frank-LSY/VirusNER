BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative factor in squamous cell
carcinomas of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva, and head and neck, and
adenocarcinoma of the cervix. We examined the demographics, clinical
characteristics, and timing of multiple potentially HPV-related cancers in
individual patients.
METHODS: One hundred forty-three patients were identified with 300 potentially
HPV-related cancers. The median follow-up from index and second cancer was 18.5
years and 3.2 years, respectively.
RESULTS: Median age at index and second cancer was 45 and 60.5 years of age,
respectively, with a median interval of 11 years. Cervical cancer was the most
common initial diagnosis (61.7%), whereas head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) was the most common second cancer (57.6%).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest differential patterns for development of multiple 
HPV-related cancers based upon clinical characteristics. Prospective longitudinal
and population-based studies are warranted to understand the impact of these
findings and opportunities for intervention and screening.
