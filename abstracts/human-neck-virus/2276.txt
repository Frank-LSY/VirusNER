Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) is associated with latent Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection and frequent relapse even after complete response (CR) to
intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The expression of EBV proteins in the
tumor provides targets for adoptive immunotherapy with antigen-specific cytotoxic
T cells (CTL). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EBV latent membrane protein
(LMP)-1 and LMP-2a-specific CTLs (LMP1/2a CTLs) stimulated with LMP1/2a
RNA-transferred dendritic cells, we treated 10 ENKTCL patients who showed
complete response to induction therapy. Patients who completed and responded to
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or high-dose therapy followed by stem cell
transplantation (HDT/SCT) were eligible to receive eight doses of 2 × 10(7)
LMP1/2a CTLs/m(2). Following infusion, there were no immediate or delayed
toxicities. The 4-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
were 100%, and 90% (95% CI: 71.4 to 100%) respectively with a median follow-up of
55·5 months. Circulating IFN-γ secreting LMP1 and LMP2a-specific T cells within
the peripheral blood corresponded with decline in plasma EBV DNA levels in
patients. Adoptive transfer of LMP1/2a CTLs in ENKTCL patients is a safe and
effective postremission therapeutic approach. Further randomized studies will be 
needed to define the role of EBV-CTLs in preventing relapse of ENKTCL.
