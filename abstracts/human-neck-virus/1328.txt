Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections predict mortality in Taiwanese patients
with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). To address their prognostic
significance for local recurrence (LR), in this retrospective cohort study we
investigated different serologic and molecular markers of HPV 16 infection in 85 
consecutive patients with primary OCSCC who received standard treatment and had
their sera stored before treatment. Resected tumor specimens were examined with
PCR-based assays for HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA expression. Sera were tested with
suspension arrays for the presence of HPV-specific antibodies using synthetic L1 
and E6 peptides as well as a synthetic E7 protein. HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA, anti-L1,
anti-E6, and anti-E7 antibodies tested positive in 12%, 25%, 38%, and 41% of the 
study patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified pathological
T3/T4, E6/E7 mRNA, and anti-E7 antibodies as independent risk factors for LR,
whereas anti-E6 antibodies were an independent protective factor. In patients
with ≥ 3 (high-risk group), 2 (intermediate-risk), and ≤ 1 (low-risk) independent
risk factors (predictors), the 5-year LR rates were 75%, 42%, and 4%,
respectively. Results were validated in an independent cohort. Together, our
preliminary data indicate that HPV 16 infections as well as low and high serum
levels of anti-E6 and anti-E7 antibodies, respectively, can serve as biomarkers
of LR in patients with OCSCC, whereas the clinical usefulness of anti-HPV 16
antibodies for risk stratification of newly diagnosed cases deserves further
scrutiny.
