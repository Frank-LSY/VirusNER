The prevalent human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect either cutaneous or mucosal
epithelium. Active Infections lead to epithelial hyperprolifeation and are
usually cleared in healthy individuals within a year. Persistent infections in
the anogenital tracts by certain high-risk genotypes such as HPV-16, HPV-18 and
closely related types, can progress to high grade dysplasias and carcinomas in
women and men, including cervical, vulva, penile and anal cancers. A significant 
fraction of the head and neck cancers are also caused by HPV-16. The viral
oncogenes responsible for neoplastic conversion are E6 and E7 that disrupt the
pathways controlled by the two major tumor suppressor genes, p53 and members of
pRB family. Because HPV cannot be propagated in conventional submerged monolayer 
cell cultures, organotypic epithelial raft cultures that generate a stratified
and differentiated epithelium have been used to study the viral life cycle. This 
article describes several systems to examine aspects of the viral productive
phase, along with the advantages and limitations. Animal model systems of HPV
carcinogenesis are also briefly described.
