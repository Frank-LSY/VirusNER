BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma is a rare salivary gland
lesion. We retrospectively reviewed CT and MR imaging features of salivary gland 
lymphoepithelial carcinoma to determine their imaging features and morphologic
patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data, CT, and MR imaging findings of 28
patients with histologically proved lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the salivary
gland were retrospectively reviewed. Morphologic patterns of the lesions were
categorized into 3 types on the basis of margin and shape.
RESULTS: There were 17 men and 11 women with a mean age of 39.3 years; 96.4% of
patients were positive for Epstein-Barr virus both on histologic staining and
Epstein-Barr virus serology. Tumors were parotid in 18 patients, submandibular in
8 patients, sublingual in 1 patient, and palatal in 1 patient. Most tumors
(57.1%) manifested as a partially or ill-defined mass with a lobulated or
plaque-like shape. Homogeneous enhancement was found in 16 patients, while
heterogeneous enhancement was found in 12, including 4 patients with intratumoral
necrosis. Invasion into adjacent structures was found in 5 patients; 60.7% of
patients exhibited abnormal lymph nodes, with nodal necrosis in 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic lobulated or plaque-like shape, with a partially 
or ill-defined margin, of a salivary gland mass associated with ipsilateral
lymphadenopathy may suggest a preoperative diagnosis of lymphoepithelial
carcinoma.
