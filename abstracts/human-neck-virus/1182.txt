Over the past 20 years, high-risk human papilloma-virus (HPV) infection has been 
established as a risk factor for developing head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, independent of tobacco and alcohol use. In particular, HPV is strongly
associated with the development of oropharyngeal cancer and a small minority of
oral cavity cancers. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about
the biology of HPV, the mechanisms by which it effects malignant transformation, 
and the potential impact of HPV status on the clinical management of persons with
head and neck cancer.
