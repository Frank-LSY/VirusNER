We report the case of a 37-year-old man with human papillomavirus-positive
squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx coexisting with chronic myelogenous
leukemia. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Within a 
few months, his rapidly growing tumor was classified as T4aN2cM0. It could be
assumed that the rapid increase in the tumor mass, which did not respond
positively to treatment, might have been associated with the coexistence of the
chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had been found incidentally. Genetic testing 
revealed the presence of insertion mutation 3020insC within the NOD2 gene, which 
might be an important genetic predisposing factor, not only for a single tumor
such as laryngeal cancer, but also for multiple primary neoplasms. The presence
of an NOD2 mutation could significantly worsen the course of the cancer.
Therefore, given the relatively high frequency of 3020insC mutations in the
general population, it might be reasonable to perform genetic testing on a wider 
scale for patients with head or neck cancer, particularly in cases that follow an
atypical course. It is also worth emphasizing the importance of thorough and
periodically repeated laryngeal examinations in patients with chronic leukemia.
