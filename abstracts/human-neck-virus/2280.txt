We report an acute myelitis in a 53-year-old woman that occurred in 7 days after 
the diagnosis of Th5-6 herpes zoster. Clinical examination revealed hyperhidrosis
of left side of her face, neck, arm and upper chest. She also had muscle weakness
of her left leg and sensory impairment for light touch and temperature in her
chest and legs. Spinal cord MRI demonstrated a longitudinal T2-hyperintense
lesion extending from Th1 to 7. In the axial imaging, the lesion dominantly
located in the left side gray matter. Hyperhidrosis, weakness and sensory
impairment were improved after intravenous therapy with acyclovir and
methylprednisolone. VZV (varicella zoster virus) IgG index of the cerebrospinal
fluid was high and serological anti aquaporin-4 antibodies were positive at the
time of the admission. This case had both characteristics of VZV myelitis and
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Myelitis relapsed 19 months after the
first attack. We believe that sympathetic hyper reactivity due to thoracic spinal
cord lesion was responsible for the hyperhidrosis in our patient.
