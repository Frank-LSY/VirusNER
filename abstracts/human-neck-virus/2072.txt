OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between FDG-PET maximum standard
uptake value (SUVmax), p16, EGFR, GLUT1 and HK2 expression in head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of p16, EGFR, GLUT1 and HK2
was performed on primary tumor tissue from 97 locally advanced HNSCC patients
treated with definitive chemoradiation. SUVmax along with p16, EGFR, GLUT1 and
HK2 expression were analyzed for associations including local control,
locoregional control and disease free survival.
RESULTS: Pretreatment SUVmax in primary tumors did not differ when stratified by 
p16, EGFR or GLUT1 expression but SUVmax was significantly higher in HK2
expressing tumors (p=0.021) and in tumors with higher T-stage (p=0.022). GLUT1
expression was significantly higher in p16 negative (p<0.001) and EGFR positive
tumors (p<0.01). HK2 expressing tumors were associated with EGFR positive tumors 
(p=0.022) but not with p16 or GLUT1 expression. EGFR positive, p16 negative and
high GLUT1 expressing tumors were associated with worse local control and disease
free survival on univariate analyses. After adjusting for patient and treatment
characteristics p16 status was the only factor that predicted for outcome on
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: High GLUT1 expression was associated with EGFR positive and p16
negative HNSCC tumors. GLUT1 maybe an important biomarker in HNSCC but its
expression appears dependent on p16 status.
