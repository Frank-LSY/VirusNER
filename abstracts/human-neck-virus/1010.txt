Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection of the head and neck region may present
with various symptoms. I present two cases of VZV infection of the pharynx and
larynx with multiple cranial nerve neuropathies. Their initial symptoms such as
sore throat, odynophagia, and dysphasia were complicated by otalgia, dizziness,
hearing loss, or ipsilateral facial nerve paralysis. All of these lesions tended 
to lateralize to the ipsilateral side and endoscopic findings suggested VZV
infections, which were confirmed by serial serologic examinations.
