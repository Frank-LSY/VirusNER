Cases 58 males 20 females included 29 oral cavity , 33 larynx , 11 pharynx 5 parotid gland .  HPV DNA found 15 ( 19.23 % ) tumors 12 HPV-16 , 2 HPV-18 1 dual infection HPV-16 HPV-18 , giving HPV-16 prevalence 86.7 % .  Higher prevalence HPV DNA found males females .  There trend towards subjects younger 58 years likely HPV-positive tumors.The 15 HPV-positive cases distributed location 8 33 ( 24.2 % ) larynx , 4 29 ( 13.8 % ) oral cavity , 2 11 ( 18.2 % ) pharynx 1 5 ( 20 % ) parotid gland . 
Oncogenic HPV infection found 19.23 % HNSCCs , genotype 16 predominating .  HPV-related HNSCC tended occur younger age compared non-HPV-related HNSCC .  The commonest site HPV-associated HNSSC Ghana larynx , rather oropharynx reported studies .  Host factors may responsible site difference work required elucidate . 
Human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) etiological factors many benign malignant lesions localized skin mucous membranes region urogenital organs head neck .  Currently , assays detection HPV based detecting presence viral nucleic acids , mostly viral DNA .  These molecular techniques divided : 1 ) methods based targeted , selective amplification nucleic acids , 2 ) signal amplification methods , 3 ) nucleic acid hybridization assays .  This paper presents explains number different HPV detection methods provides examples commonly available commercial tests . 
Recent studies revealed important intriguing role human papillomavirus ( HPV ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) .  There indications prevalence HPV-positive HNSCC recently increased , genetic analyses point completely distinct class HNSCCs .  Most studies suggest patients type tumour better prognosis argue adjusted therapeutic approach needed .  One crucial point research HNSCC-HPV involvement often neglected , lack standardised assay detect HPV .  This resulted considerable variation frequency HPV-positive tumours studies reported thus far .  Especially PCR-based tests , risk exists assay sensitive detects virus without implying causal involvement HNSCC .  A reliable algorithm detect clinically relevant HPV infection formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue recently become available .  Here , address important biological analytical aspects HPV involved development HNSCC emphasised standardised HPV assay prerequisite assessing clinical importance HPV infection HNSCC . 
The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) comprises heterogeneous group double-strand DNA viruses variable potential infect human epithelial cells trigger neoplastic transformation .  Its 8 kb genome encodes proteins required virus replication self-organized formation infectious particles also early proteins E6 E7 able trigger neoplastic transformation .  E6 E7 high-risk ( HR ) HPV subtypes bind p53 release E2F abrogate replication control .  Due variable amino acid sequence ( AAS ) binding sites E6 E7 particular HR-HPV variants within subtypes essentially heterogeneous efficacy triggering neoplastic transformation cancer development .  This could explain differences clinical course HPV-driven head neck cancer . 
Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) common sexually transmitted viral infection .  Infection certain types HPV pose major public health risk types associated multiple human cancers , including cervical cancer , anogenital malignancies increasing number head neck cancers .  The HPV life cycle closely tied host cell differentiation late viral events structural gene expression viral genome amplification taking place upper layers stratified epithelium .  The DNA damage response ( DDR ) elaborate signaling network proteins regulate fidelity replication detecting , signaling repairing DNA lesions .  ATM ATR two kinases major regulators DNA damage detection repair .  A multitude studies indicate activation ATM ( Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) ATR ( Ataxia telangiectasia Rad3-related ) pathways critical HPV productively replicate .  This review outlines HPV interfaces ATM- ATR-dependent DNA damage responses throughout viral life cycle create environment supportive viral replication activation pathways could impact genomic stability . 
Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection causally associated benign malignant diseases upper airway , including respiratory papillomatosis oropharyngeal cancer .  Low-risk HPV types 6 11 predominant cause papillomatosis , whereas HPV16 definitively satisfies molecular epidemiological causal criteria carcinogenic high-risk type upper airway .  HPV16 E6/E7 mRNA expression integration observed predominantly among oropharyngeal cancers , experimental models shown E6/E7 expression necessary initiation maintenance malignant phenotype cancers .  From epidemiological perspective , strong consistent association markers HPV16 exposure oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated numerous case-control studies .  HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers also shown distinct HPV-negative head neck squamous cell cancers regard risk-factor profiles , molecular genetic alterations , population-level incidence trends time , prognosis .  Tumor HPV status ( determined certain HPV16 situ hybridization assays certain p16 immunohistochemistry assays ) strongest determinant survival patients local-regionally advanced oropharyngeal cancer : patients HPV-positive cancer least 50 % improvement overall survival 5 years , equivalent approximate 30 % difference absolute survival .  Thus , HPV status determination part routine diagnostic evaluation prognostication .  Preliminary evidence indicates small proportion head neck cancers may caused additional HPV types ( e.g. , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 ) HPV-caused cancers may rarely arise non-oropharyngeal sites ( e.g. , oral cavity , nasopharynx , larynx ) .  Whether HPV vaccination potential prevent oral HPV infections lead cancer papillomatosis upper airway currently unknown , potential secondary prevention HPV detection .  This article forms part special supplement entitled `` Comprehensive Control HPV Infections Related Diseases '' Vaccine Volume 30 , Supplement 5 , 2012 . 
To evaluate outcomes patients pathological N3 ( pN3 ) neck disease human papillomavirus ( HPV ) #NAME? oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) determine variables predictive survival . 
Retrospective case series chart review . 
This study conducted 1998 2013 included patients HPV-related OPSCC treated surgery without adjuvant therapy pN3 nodal disease .  The primary outcome disease-specific survival ( DSS ) .  Secondary outcomes included overall survival ( OS ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , adverse events , gastrostomy tube rates . 
Thirty-nine patients included , 36 ( 90 % ) underwent adjuvant therapy .  Median follow-up 39 months ( range , 2-147 months ) .  Mean age 56 years , 87 % male .  Seventeen patients ( 44 % ) underwent selective neck dissection , whereas six ( 15 % ) underwent radical ( n = 2 ) extended radical ( n = 4 ) neck dissection .  Ninety-two percent extracapsular extension .  Five-year Kaplan-Meier estimated DSS , OS , DFS 89 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 79 % -99 % ) , 87 % ( 95 % CI : 75 % -99 % ) , 84 % ( 95 % CI : 72 % -96 % ) , respectively .  The disease recurrence rate 10 % ( 5 % regional , 5 % distant metastasis ) .  Patients less 5 pathologically positive lymph nodes ( P = 0.041 ) improved DFS . 
Patients HPV-related OPSCC pN3 nodal disease treated surgery adjuvant therapy favorable long-term survival regional control .  Patients five pathologically positive lymph nodes may higher risk recurrence .
