Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) sixth common cancer annual incidence approximately 400,000 worldwide .  Although principal risk factors head neck cancer remain tobacco alcohol use , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) recently found etiologically associated 20 25 % HNSCC , mostly oropharynx .  HPV causes human cancers expressing two viral oncoproteins , E6 E7 .  These oncoproteins degrade destabilize two major tumor suppressor proteins , p53 pRb , ubiquitination .  Additional studies shown E6 E7 directly bind multiple host proteins p53 pRb ( e.g. , Bak p21 ( Cip1 ) ) , contributing genetic instability .  However , expression E6 E7 alone sufficient cellular transformation , additional genetic alterations necessary malignant progression setting virus-induced genomic instability unknown .  In addition etiological differences , HPV-positive cancers clinically distinct compared HPV-negative cancers regard treatment response survival outcome , tumor HPV-positivity favorable prognostic biomarker .  Further understanding carcinogenesis clinical behavior HPV-positive cancers improve disease prevention , patient care , surveillance strategies HNSCC patients .
