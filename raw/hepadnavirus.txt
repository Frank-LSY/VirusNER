In occult hepatitis B infection (OBI), hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) can be
detected in serum samples; however, oral fluid collection for detection of HBV
DNA has not yet been explored, despite the availability of collection devices.
Serum and oral fluid samples from 45 hepatitis B core antibody
(anti-HBc)-positive patients were collected for the amplification of the HBV
polymerase gene. HBV DNA was detected in five serum and four oral fluid samples
(the detection limit for oral fluid was 1.656 log IU/mL in paired serum). In
conclusion, simple methodologies of sample collection and in-house polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) allowed detection of HBV DNA, and these could be used to
improve the diagnosis of OBI, especially in locations with limited resources.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic virus that causes acute and chronic
inflammatory liver diseases, often leading to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Although many studies for the roles of HBV on pathogenesis of
the liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic
inflammation, cirrhosis, and HCC, have been reported, the mechanisms are not
fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have the protective
mechanisms to restore their damaged function by intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, 
but their chronic dysfunctions are associated with the pathogenesis of the
various diseases. Furthermore, HBV can affect intra- or extracellular homeostasis
through induction of ER and mitochondrial dysfunctions, leading to liver injury. 
Therefore, the mechanism by which HBV induces ER or mitochondrial stresses may be
a therapeutic target for treatment of liver diseases.

BACKGROUND: Proper management of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection requires monitoring of plasma or serum HBV DNA levels using a highly
sensitive nucleic acid amplification test. Because commercially available assays 
differ in performance, we compared herein the performance of the Hologic Aptima
HBV Quant assay (Aptima) to that of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV test for use with 
the high pure system (HPS/CTM).
METHODS: Assay performance was assessed using HBV reference panels as well as
plasma and serum samples from chronically HBV-infected patients. Method
correlation, analytical sensitivity, precision/reproducibility, linearity, bias
and influence of genotype were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using
linear regression, Deming correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: Agreement between the assays for the two reference panels was good, with
a difference in assay values vs. target <0.5 log. Qualitative assay results for
159 clinical samples showed good concordance (88.1%; κ=0.75; 95% confidence
interval: 0.651-0.845). For the 106 samples quantitated by both assays, viral
load results were highly correlated (R=0.92) and differed on average by 0.09 log,
with 95.3% of the samples being within the 95% limit of agreement of the assays. 
Linearity for viral loads 1-7 log was excellent for both assays (R2>0.98). The
two assays had similar bias and precision across the different genotypes tested
at low viral loads (25-1000 IU/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: Aptima has a performance comparable with that of HPS/CTM, making it 
suitable for use for HBV infection monitoring. Aptima runs on a fully automated
platform (the Panther system) and therefore offers a significantly improved
workflow compared with HPS/CTM.

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exhibits a variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from
spontaneous resolution of hepatitis B to severe adverse consequences, including
the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The 
heterogeneous clinical courses of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
reflect the complex host-virus interactions, and point to the difficulty and
necessity of identifying the patients at risk. With the advance of HBV virology, 
several viral factors have been found to be associated with the long-term
clinical outcomes of CHB patients. Different viral factors probe different
aspects of CHB. Integration of these viral factors may help to determine the
disease state of patients more accurately, and identify the patients who require 
timely antiviral therapy to prevent the development of detrimental clinical
outcomes. In this article, we will introduce the conventional and emerging viral 
factors that are associated with clinical outcomes and discuss their utility in a
clinical setting.

In 2015, we identified an avian hepatitis B virus associated with hepatitis in a 
group of captive elegant-crested tinamous (Eudromia elegans) in Germany. The
full-length genome of this virus shares <76% sequence identity with other
avihepadnaviruses. The virus may therefore be considered a new extant avian
hepadnavirus.

Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) increases the risk of developing
fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies are limited to
type-I interferons and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues; however, these are only
partially effective. The development of novel anti-HBV agents for new treatment
strategies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable system that allows the
in vitro replication of HBV. Studies of virus infection/replication at the
molecular level using wild-type HBV are labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
overcome these problems, we previously constructed a recombinant reporter HBV
bearing the NanoLuc gene and showed its usefulness in identifying factors that
affect HBV proliferation. Because this system mimics the early stage of the HBV
life cycle faithfully, we conducted a quantitative analysis of HBV infectivity to
several human hepatocyte cell lines as well as the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide
and HBV protein X on the early stage of HBV proliferation using this system.
Furthermore, we developed a system to produce a reporter HBV expressing a pol
gene. These reporter HBV may provide an opportunity to enhance our understanding 
of the HBV life cycle and aid strategies for the development of new anti-HBV
agents.

Hepatitis B virus is a member of the Hepadnaviridae family and responsible for
causing acute and chronic hepatitis in humans. The current estimates of people
chronically infected with the virus are put at 250 million worldwide.
Immune-mediated liver damage in these individuals may lead to the development of 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. This review deals with our 
current understanding of the virology, molecular biology, life cycle and
cell-to-cell spread of this very important pathogen, all of which are considered 
essential for current and future approaches to antiviral treatment.

In mammals, protein arginine methyltransferase 5, PRMT5, is the main type II
enzyme responsible for the majority of symmetric dimethylarginine formation in
polypeptides. Recent study reported that PRMT5 restricts Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
replication through epigenetic repression of HBV DNA transcription and
interference with encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Here we demonstrate that PRMT5
interacts with the HBV core (HBc) protein and dimethylates arginine residues
within the arginine-rich domain (ARD) of the carboxyl-terminus. ARD consists of
four arginine rich subdomains, ARDI, ARDII, ARDIII and ARDIV. Mutation analysis
of ARDs revealed that arginine methylation of HBc required the wild-type status
of both ARDI and ARDII. Mass spectrometry analysis of HBc identified multiple
potential ubiquitination, methylation and phosphorylation sites, out of which
lysine K7 and arginines R150 (within ARDI) and R156 (outside ARDs) were shown to 
be modified by ubiquitination and methylation, respectively. The HBc symmetric
dimethylation appeared to be linked to serine phosphorylation and nuclear import 
of HBc protein. Conversely, the monomethylated HBc retained in the cytoplasm.
Thus, overexpression of PRMT5 led to increased nuclear accumulation of HBc, and
vice versa, down-regulation of PRMT5 resulted in reduced levels of HBc in nuclei 
of transfected cells. In summary, we identified PRMT5 as a potent controller of
HBc cell trafficking and function and described two novel types of HBc
post-translational modifications (PTMs), arginine methylation and ubiquitination.

Perinatal transmission is one of the most common routes of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) transmission. This study aims to identify the epidemiological features of
HBV among pregnant Iranian women. This study followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Two authors
independently searched several online databases without time limit until May
2017. The databases include Magiran, Iranmedex, SID, Medlib, IranDoc, Scopus,
PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The data
were analyzed based on a random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
software version 2. Thirty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The 
prevalence of HBV among pregnant Iranian women was 1.18% (95% CI: 0.09%-1.53%).
The prevalence of HBV among pregnant women living in urban and rural areas was
1.60% (95% CI: 0.06%-4.30%) and 1.70% (95% CI: 0.09%-3.2%), respectively. The
prevalence of HBV among housewives and working pregnant women was 4.3% (95% CI:
1.4%-12.5%) and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.02%-5.8%), respectively. The risk of developing
an HBV infection was significantly associated with illiteracy (p = 0.013),
abortion (p = 0.001), blood transfusion (p < 0.001) and addicted spouse
(p = 0.045). However, no significant relationship was observed between HBV
infection and urbanization (p = 0.65), occupation (p = 0.37), history of surgery 
(p = 0.32) or tattooing (p = 0.69). Vaccination coverage (receiving at least a
single dose) in pregnant women was 9.8% (95% CI: 5.3%-17.5%). The prevalence of
HBV among pregnant women is lower than in the general population of Iran. HBV
vaccination coverage was low among pregnant Iranian women. Therefore, health
policy-makers are recommended to enforce immunization programs for HBV
vaccination among high-risk pregnant women.

Interferon-α (IFN-α) is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 
but only 20%-40% of patients respond well. Clinical observations have suggested
that HBV genotype is associated with the response to IFN therapy; however, its
role in viral responsiveness to IFN in HBV-infected hepatocytes remains unclear. 
Here, we produced infectious virions of HBV genotypes A to D to infect three
well-recognized cell-culture-based HBV infection systems, including primary human
hepatocytes (PHH), differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG), and HepG2-NTCP cells to
quantitatively compare the antiviral effect of IFN-α on HBV across genotypes and 
cell models. The efficacy of IFN-α against HBV in hepatocytes was generally
similar across genotypes A2, B5, C2, and D3; however, it was significantly
different among the infection models given that the half maximal inhibitory
concentration value of IFN-α for inhibition of viral DNA replication in PHH (<20 
U/mL) and dHepaRG cells were much lower than that in HepG2-NTCP cells (>500
U/mL). Notably, even in PHH, IFN-α did not reduce HBV covalently closed circular 
DNA at the concentrations for which viral antigens and DNA replication
intermediates were strongly reduced. The three cell-culture models exhibited
differential cellular response to IFN-α. The genes reported to be associated with
responsiveness to IFN-α in patients were robustly induced in PHH while weakly
induced in HepG2-NTCP cells upon IFN-α treatment. Reduction or promotion of IFN
response in PHH or HepG2-NTCP cells significantly attenuated or improved the
inhibitory capacity of IFN-α on HBV replication, respectively.CONCLUSION: In the 
cell-culture-based HBV infection models, the sensitivity of HBV to IFN-α in
hepatocytes is determined more by the cell-intrinsic IFN response than by viral
genotype, and improvement of the IFN response in HepG2-NTCP cells promotes the
efficacy of IFN-α against HBV. (Hepatology 2018;67:1237-1252).

INTRODUCTION: Flavocoxid is a proprietary blend of two flavonoids, baicalin and
catechin, and recent evidence has shown that bioflavonoids may exert antiviral
activities. The potential antiviral activity of Flavocoxid against hepatitis B
virus (HBV) was evaluated. Additionally, it was investigated if Flavocoxid used
in combination with Entecavir could potentiate its anti-HBV activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatoma cells replicating HBV were treated with
Flavocoxid, or Entecavir alone or in combination for up to 5 days. Viral
replicative intermediates, transcripts, and cccDNA levels were evaluated in
HBV-replicating cells by real-time PCR, Southern and Northern blotting.
Expression profiling was performed using TaqMan low-density arrays.
RESULTS: Flavocoxid treatment induced a reduction of HBV replicative
intermediates, the amount of transcripts, and HBsAg levels. Flavocoxid and
Entecavir combination therapy further decreased the amount of HBV replicative
intermediates, compared to Flavocoxid alone. Importantly, Flavocoxid alone or in 
combination with Entecavir also induced a reduction of cccDNA. Gene-expression
analysis showed that Flavocoxid activates type I IFNs-signaling and dampens the
HBV-induced inflammatory response.
CONCLUSIONS: Flavocoxid inhibits HBV replication by targeting multiple steps of
viral life cycle. These results indicate that the antiviral activity of Entecavir
is potentiated by Flavocoxid, suggesting that this medical food might be
considered as an adjuvant for anti-HBV therapy.

Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs), which are enveloped viruses with reverse-transcribed 
DNA genomes, constitute the family Hepadnaviridae. An outstanding feature of HBVs
is their streamlined genome organization with extensive gene overlap. Remarkably,
the ∼1,100 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding the envelope proteins is fully
nested within the ORF of the viral replicase P. Here, we report the discovery of 
a diversified family of fish viruses, designated nackednaviruses, which lack the 
envelope protein gene, but otherwise exhibit key characteristics of HBVs
including genome replication via protein-primed reverse-transcription and
utilization of structurally related capsids. Phylogenetic reconstruction
indicates that these two virus families separated more than 400 million years ago
before the rise of tetrapods. We show that HBVs are of ancient origin, descending
from non-enveloped progenitors in fishes. Their envelope protein gene emerged de 
novo, leading to a major transition in viral lifestyle, followed by co-evolution 
with their hosts over geologic eras.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a significant public health burden
worldwide. Although current therapeutics manage to control the disease
progression, lifelong treatment and surveillance are required because drug
resistance develops during treatment and reactivations frequently occur following
medication cessation. Thus, the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma is
decreased, but not eliminated. One major reason for failure of HBV treatment is
the inability to eradicate or inactivate the viral covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which is a stable episomal form of the viral genome decorated with host
histones and nonhistone proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic 
modifications of cccDNA contribute to viral replication and the outcome of
chronic HBV infection. Here, we summarize current progress on HBV epigenetics
research and the therapeutic implications for chronic HBV infection by learning
from the epigenetic therapies for cancer and other viral diseases, which may open
a new venue to cure chronic hepatitis B. (Hepatology 2017;66:2066-2077).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects 250 million people worldwide,
resulting in nearly one million deaths annually. Studies in recent years have
significantly improved our knowledge on the mechanisms of HBV persistence. HBV
uses multiple pathways to harness host innate immunity to enhance its
replication. It can also take advantage of the developing immune system and the
not-yet-stabilized gut microbiota of young children to facilitate its
persistence, and use maternal viral e antigen to educate immunity of the
offspring to support its persistence after vertical transmission. The knowledge
gained from these recent studies paves the way for the development of new
therapies for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, which has so far been very 
challenging.

The majority of persons currently treated for chronic hepatitis B require
long-term or lifelong therapy. New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry,
replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in
development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B
necessitates a standardised appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these
treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical
trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to
regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 
to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical
trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete
sterilising cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be
feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterised by sustained loss of hepatitis
B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion,
which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of
patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. 
Development of standardised assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining
hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel
antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments
can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy
or to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies 
will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited
proof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity
should be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety of
any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of
currently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues.

The landscape for chronic HBV therapy is rapidly evolving. The latest generation 
of antiviral drugs provide robust virus suppression with a high barrier to
resistance that facilitates long-term treatment. However, low rates of HBsAg loss
demonstrate that additional strategies are needed to consistency achieve a
functional cure. The immune system can clear HBV and establish long-term control 
over the virus. Sufficiently boosting HBV immunity in chronic patients has been
very difficult due to immune exhaustion, immune dysregulation, and inhibitory
pathways suppressing the immune response. Therapeutic vaccines employing new
technology, vectors and new immunomodulatory drugs that can elicit direct
antiviral effects and cancel inhibitory mechanism may be able to overcome
exhaustion. This review will discuss the justification for immunotherapy, lessons
from previous trials and new vaccines/drugs in early stage clinical trials. The
challenges of correlating immune responses induced by these drugs to clinical
efficacy will also be addressed.

Metabolic remodeling occurs in immune cells during an infection. Host cells must 
upregulate energy production for growth, proliferation, and effector functions to
limit the damage imposed by pathogens. One example, the hepatitis B virus,
induces hepatic injury in human hepatocytes through dysregulation of aerobic
glycolysis and lipid metabolism. Increased glycolytic metabolism mediated by
elevated expression of Glut1, glucose influx, and lactate secretion is associated
with this Warburg phenotype, a classic metabolic signature also observed in
cancer cells. This article brings into focus the tight interaction between HBV
infection and metabolic dysfunction and how these processes facilitate the
progression of end-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. We
also provide evidence and models by which other viruses such as HIV and Zika
disrupt their host metabolic machinery. The emergence of the immunometabolism
field provides novel opportunities to take advantage of intermediary metabolites 
and key metabolic pathways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a major health burden
worldwide; it can cause various degrees of liver damage and is strongly
associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The molecular mechanisms determining HBV persistence are not fully understood,
but these appear to be multifactorial and the unique replication strategy
employed by HBV enables its maintenance in infected hepatocytes. Both the
stability of the HBV genome, which forms a stable minichromosome, the covalently 
closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the hepatocyte nucleus, and the inability of the 
immune system to resolve chronic HBV infection are believed to be key mechanisms 
of HBV chronicity. Since a true cure of HBV requires clearance of intranuclear
cccDNA from infected hepatocytes, understanding the mechanisms involved in cccDNA
biogenesis, regulation and stability is mandatory to achieve HBV eradication.
This review will summarize the state of knowledge on these mechanisms including
the impact of current treatments on the cccDNA stability and activity. We will
focus on events challenging cccDNA persistence in dividing hepatocytes.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects approximately 240 million
people worldwide and remains a serious public health concern because its complete
cure is impossible with current treatments. Covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected cells cannot be eliminated by present
therapeutics and may result in persistence and relapse. Drug development
targeting cccDNA formation and maintenance is hindered by the lack of efficient
cccDNA models and reliable cccDNA detection methods. Southern blotting is
regarded as the gold standard for quantitative cccDNA detection, but it is
complicated and not suitable for high-throughput drug screening, so more
sensitive and simple methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
methods, Invader assays, in situ hybridization and surrogates, have been
developed for cccDNA detection. However, most methods are not reliable enough,
and there are no unified standards for these approaches. This review will
summarize available methods for cccDNA detection. It is hoped that more robust
methods for cccDNA monitoring will be developed and that standard operation
procedures for routine cccDNA detection in scientific research and clinical
monitoring will be established.

OBJECTIVES: To identify within-host quasispecies characteristics of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) in mothers and children infected via mother-to-child transmission
(MTCT).
METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed sequences within the
non-overlapping pre-core/core (pre-C/C) gene in 37 mother-child pairs.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic and Highlighter analyses suggested that both a single
strain and multiple distinct strains may be transmitted in MTCT of HBV. However, 
analysis of reassembled viral sequences revealed a relatively narrow distribution
of variants in children, which was confirmed by a lower viral diversity in
children than that in mothers. New closely related variants with combinations of 
two to five high-frequency mutations were observed in seven children with
elevated ALT levels; the new variants out-competed the transmitted maternal
variants to become the dominant strains in five of them. Furthermore, 30
mutations with a frequency >1% of all viruses within-host were present in those
children; the mutations caused 19 amino-acid substitutions. Interestingly, almost
all were located within the well-known T-cell or B-cell epitopes.
CONCLUSIONS: There are restrictive changes that occur in the early stages of
chronic HBV infection through MTCT with different clinical consequences. These
data might have important implications for future investigations of interrelated 
immunopathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.

Worldwide, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem
and no cure exists. Importantly, hepatocyte intrusion by HBV particles results in
a complex deregulation of both viral and host cellular genetic and epigenetic
processes. Among the attempts to develop novel therapeutic approaches against HBV
infection, several options targeting the epigenomic regulation of HBV replication
are gaining attention. These include the experimental treatment with 'epidrugs'. 
Moreover, as a targeted approach, the principle of 'epigenetic editing' recently 
is being exploited to control viral replication. Silencing of HBV by specific
rewriting of epigenetic marks might diminish viral replication, viremia, and
infectivity, eventually controlling the disease and its complications.
Additionally, epigenetic editing can be used as an experimental tool to increase 
our limited understanding regarding the role of epigenetic modifications in viral
infections. Aiming for permanent epigenetic reprogramming of the viral genome
without unspecific side effects, this breakthrough may pave the roads for an
ambitious technological pursuit: to start designing a curative approach utilizing
manipulative molecular therapies for viral infections in vivo.

EASL 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus
infection.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem with
changing epidemiology due to several factors including vaccination policies and
migration. This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for 
the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified 
into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positive
chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative
chronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV
infection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy is
to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, and
consequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV
replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while
HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires 
HBV DNA >2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, 
while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated.
Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in 
pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients
requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a
potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir,
tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of
choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild to
moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generally
recommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression and
HCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCC
remains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Several
subgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment
strategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.

Hepatitis B X protein (HBx) plays an essential role in the hepatitis B virus
(HBV) replication cycle, but the function of HBx has been elusive until recently.
It was recently shown that transcription from the HBV genome (covalently-closed
circular DNA, cccDNA) is inhibited by the structural maintenance of chromosome
5/6 complex (Smc5/6), and that a key function of HBx is to redirect the
DNA-damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) E3 ubiquitin ligase to target this complex
for degradation. By doing so, HBx alleviates transcriptional repression by Smc5/6
and stimulates HBV gene expression. In this review, we discuss in detail how the 
interplay between HBx and Smc5/6 was identified and characterized. We also
discuss what is known regarding the repression of cccDNA transcription by Smc5/6,
the timing of HBx expression, and the potential role of HBx in promoting
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a para-retrovirus or retroid virus that contains a
double-stranded DNA genome and replicates this DNA via reverse transcription of a
RNA pregenome. Viral reverse transcription takes place within a capsid upon
packaging of the RNA and the viral reverse transcriptase. A major characteristic 
of HBV replication is the selection of capsids containing the double-stranded
DNA, but not those containing the RNA or the single-stranded DNA replication
intermediate, for envelopment during virion secretion. The complete HBV virion
particles thus contain an outer envelope, studded with viral envelope proteins,
that encloses the capsid, which, in turn, encapsidates the double-stranded DNA
genome. Furthermore, HBV morphogenesis is characterized by the release of
subviral particles that are several orders of magnitude more abundant than the
complete virions. One class of subviral particles are the classical surface
antigen particles (Australian antigen) that contain only the viral envelope
proteins, whereas the more recently discovered genome-free (empty) virions
contain both the envelope and capsid but no genome. In addition, recent evidence 
suggests that low levels of RNA-containing particles may be released, after all. 
We will summarize what is currently known about how the complete and incomplete
HBV particles are assembled. We will discuss briefly the functions of the
subviral particles, which remain largely unknown. Finally, we will explore the
utility of the subviral particles, particularly, the potential of empty virions
and putative RNA virions as diagnostic markers and the potential of empty virons 
as a vaccine candidate.

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of hepadnavirus core protein is involved in multiple 
steps of viral replication. In particular, the CTD is initially phosphorylated at
multiple sites to facilitate viral RNA packaging into immature nucleocapsids
(NCs) and the early stage of viral DNA synthesis. For the avian hepadnavirus duck
hepatitis B virus (DHBV), CTD is dephosphorylated subsequently to facilitate the 
late stage of viral DNA synthesis and to stabilize NCs containing mature viral
DNA. The role of CTD phosphorylation in virion secretion, if any, has remained
unclear. Here, the CTD from the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found to be
dephosphorylated in association with NC maturation and secretion of
DNA-containing virions, as in DHBV. In contrast, the CTD in empty HBV virions
(i.e., enveloped capsids with no RNA or DNA) was found to be phosphorylated. The 
potential role of CTD dephosphorylation in virion secretion was analyzed through 
mutagenesis. For secretion of empty HBV virions, which is independent of either
viral RNA packaging or DNA synthesis, multiple substitutions in the CTD to mimic 
either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation showed little detrimental effect.
Similarly, phospho-mimetic substitutions in the DHBV CTD did not block the
secretion of DNA-containing virions. These results indicate that CTD
dephosphorylation, though associated with NC maturation in both HBV and DHBV, is 
not essential for the subsequent NC-envelope interaction to secrete
DNA-containing virions, and the CTD state of phosphorylation also does not play
an essential role in the interaction between empty capsids and the envelope for
secretion of empty virions.IMPORTANCE The phosphorylation state of the C-terminal
domain (CTD) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core or capsid protein is highly dynamic 
and plays multiple roles in the viral life cycle. To study the potential role of 
the state of phosphorylation of CTD in virion secretion, we have analyzed the CTD
phosphorylation state in complete (containing the genomic DNA) versus empty
(genome-free) HBV virions. Whereas CTD is unphosphorylated in complete virions,
it is phosphorylated in empty virions. Mutational analyses indicate that neither 
phosphorylation nor dephosphorylation of CTD is required for virion secretion.
These results demonstrate that while CTD dephosphorylation is associated with HBV
DNA synthesis, the CTD state of phosphorylation may not regulate virion
secretion.

BACKGROUND: The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) HBx regulatory protein is required for
HBV replication and involved in HBV-related carcinogenesis. HBx interacts with
chromatin modifying enzymes and transcription factors to modulate histone
post-translational modifications and to regulate viral cccDNA transcription and
cellular gene expression. Aiming to identify genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)
directly targeted by HBx, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-Seq) to analyse HBV recruitment on host cell chromatin in cells replicating
HBV.
RESULTS: ChIP-Seq high throughput sequencing of HBx-bound fragments was used to
obtain a high-resolution, unbiased, mapping of HBx binding sites across the
genome in HBV replicating cells. Protein-coding genes and ncRNAs involved in cell
metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer were enriched among HBx targets
together with genes/ncRNAs known to modulate HBV replication. The direct
transcriptional activation of genes/miRNAs that potentiate endocytosis
(Ras-related in brain (RAB) GTPase family) and autophagy (autophagy related (ATG)
genes, beclin-1, miR-33a) and the transcriptional repression of microRNAs
(miR-138, miR-224, miR-576, miR-596) that directly target the HBV pgRNA and would
inhibit HBV replication, contribute to HBx-mediated increase of HBV replication.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ChIP-Seq analysis of HBx genome wide chromatin recruitment
defined the repertoire of genes and ncRNAs directly targeted by HBx and led to
the identification of new mechanisms by which HBx positively regulates cccDNA
transcription and HBV replication.

While nanoparticle vaccine technology is gaining interest due to the success of
vaccines like those for the human papillomavirus that is based on viral capsid
nanoparticles, little information is available on the disassembly and reassembly 
of viral surface glycoprotein-based nanoparticles. One such particle is the
hepatitis B virus surface antigen (sAg) that exists as nanoparticles. Here we
show, using biochemical analysis coupled with electron microscopy, that sAg
nanoparticle disassembly requires both reducing agent to disrupt intermolecular
disulfide bonds, and detergent to disrupt hydrophobic interactions that stabilize
the nanoparticle. Particles were otherwise resistant to salt and urea, suggesting
the driving mechanism of particle formation involves hydrophobic interactions. We
reassembled isolated sAg protein into nanoparticles by detergent removal and
reassembly resulted in a wider distribution of particle diameters. Knowledge of
these driving forces of nanoparticle assembly and stability should facilitate
construction of epitope-displaying nanoparticles that can be used as immunogens
in vaccines.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) is 
the main target of most hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific entry inhibitors.
Unfortunately, these agents also block NTCP transport of bile acids into
hepatocytes, and thus have the potential to cause adverse effects. We aimed to
identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP
transporter function.
METHODS: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their
anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing
NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested 
for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. 
Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed.
RESULTS: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with 
a sub-micromolar IC50. Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against 
calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. This
suggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit 
viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function.
Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependent
uptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinically
relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of 
HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that the
anti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. These
broadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing new
drugs with fewer adverse effects.
LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we identified new compounds that selectively
inhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry, and did not impair bile acid uptake. Our
evidence offers a new strategy for developing anti-HBV drugs with fewer side
effects.

Endogenous viral elements (EVE) in animal genomes are the fossil records of
ancient viruses and provide invaluable information on the origin and evolution of
extant viruses. Extant hepadnaviruses include avihepadnaviruses of birds and
orthohepadnaviruses of mammals. The core promoter (Cp) of hepadnaviruses is vital
for viral gene expression and replication. We previously identified in the
budgerigar genome two EVEs that contain the full-length genome of an ancient
budgerigar hepadnavirus (eBHBV1 and eBHBV2). Here, we found eBHBV1 Cp and eBHBV2 
Cp were active in several human and chicken cell lines. A region from nt -85
to -11 in eBHBV1 Cp was critical for the promoter activity. Bioinformatic
analysis revealed a putative binding site of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), a
ubiquitous transcription factor, at nt -64 to -50 in eBHBV1 Cp. The NF-Y core
binding site (ATTGG, nt -58 to -54) was essential for eBHBV1 Cp activity. The
same results were obtained with eBHBV2 Cp and duck hepatitis B virus Cp. The
subunit A of NF-Y (NF-YA) was recruited via the NF-Y core binding site to eBHBV1 
Cp and upregulated the promoter activity. Finally, the NF-Y core binding site is 
conserved in the Cps of all the extant avihepadnaviruses but not of
orthohepadnaviruses. Interestingly, a putative and functionally important NF-Y
core binding site is located at nt -21 to -17 in the Cp of human hepatitis B
virus. In conclusion, our findings have pinpointed an evolutionary conserved and 
functionally critical NF-Y binding element in the Cps of avihepadnaviruses.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA is essential to the 
virus life cycle, its elimination during chronic infection is considered critical
to a durable therapy but has not been achieved by current antivirals. Despite
being essential, cccDNA has not been the major target of high throughput
screening (HTS), largely because of the limitations of current HBV tissue culture
systems, including the impracticality of detecting cccDNA itself. In response to 
this need, we have previously developed a proof-of-concept HepDE19 cell line in
which the production of wildtype e antigen (HBeAg) is dependent upon cccDNA.
However, the existing assay system is not ideal for HTS because the HBeAg ELISA
cross reacts with a viral HBeAg homologue, which is the core antigen (HBcAg)
expressed largely in a cccDNA-independent fashion in HepDE19 cells. To further
improve the assay specificity, we report herein a "second-generation" cccDNA
reporter cell line, termed HepBHAe82. In the similar principle of HepDE19 line,
an in-frame HA epitope tag was introduced into the precore domain of HBeAg open
reading frame in the transgene of HepBHAe82 cells without disrupting any
cis-element critical for HBV replication and HBeAg secretion. A chemiluminescence
ELISA assay (CLIA) for the detection of HA-tagged HBeAg with HA antibody serving 
as capture antibody and HBeAb serving as detection antibody has been developed to
eliminate the confounding signal from HBcAg. The miniaturized HepBHAe82 cell
based assay system exhibits high level of cccDNA-dependent HA-HBeAg production
and high specific readout signals with low background. We have also established a
HepHA-HBe4 cell line expressing transgene-dependent HA-HBeAg as a counter screen 
to identify HBeAg inhibitors. The HepBHAe82 system is amenable to antiviral HTS
development, and can be used to identify host factors that regulate cccDNA
metabolism and transcription.

HBx is a hepatitis B virus protein that is required for viral infectivity and
replication. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are thought to be among the
important host targets of HBx. However, the structure and function of HBx are
poorly understood and the molecular mechanism of HBx-induced carcinogenesis
remains unknown. In this study, we report biochemical and structural
characterization of HBx. The recombinant HBx protein contains metal ions, in
particular iron and zinc. A BH3-like motif in HBx (residues 110-135) binds Bcl-2 
with a dissociation constant of ∼193 μM, which is drastically lower than that for
a canonical BH3 motif from Bim or Bad. Structural analysis reveals that, similar 
to other BH3 motifs, the BH3-like motif of HBx adopts an amphipathic α-helix and 
binds the conserved BH3-binding groove on Bcl-2. Unlike the helical Bim or Bad
BH3 motif, the C-terminal portion of the bound HBx BH3-like motif has an extended
conformation and makes considerably fewer interactions with Bcl-2. These
observations suggest that HBx may modulate Bcl-2 function in a way that is
different from that of the classical BH3-only proteins.

The efficient replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) requires the HBV regulatory 
hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein. The exact contributions of HBx are not fully
understood, in part because of the limitations of the assays used for its study. 
When HBV replication is driven from a plasmid DNA, the contribution of HBx is
modest. However, there is an absolute requirement for HBx in assays that
recapitulate the infectious virus life cycle. There is much evidence that HBx can
contribute directly to HBV replication by acting on viral promoters embedded
within protein coding sequences. In addition, HBx may also contribute indirectly 
by modulating cellular pathways to benefit virus replication. Understanding the
mechanism(s) of HBx action during virus replication may provide insight into
novel ways to disrupt chronic HBV replication.

Laboratory, Doherty Institute, Melbourne 3000, Australia.

Members of the family Hepadnaviridae fall into two subgroups: mammalian and
avian. The detection of endogenous avian hepadnavirus DNA integrated into the
genomes of zebra finches has revealed a deep evolutionary origin of
hepadnaviruses that was not previously recognized, dating back at least 40
million and possibly >80 million years ago. The nonprimate mammalian members of
the Hepadnaviridae include the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), the ground
squirrel hepatitis virus, and arctic squirrel hepatitis virus, as well as a
number of members of the recently described bat hepatitis virus. The
identification of hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) in higher primates, such as
chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbons that cluster with the human HBV, as
well as a number of recombinant forms between humans and primates, further
implies a more complex origin of this virus. We discuss the current theories of
the origin and evolution of HBV and propose a model that includes cross-species
transmissions and subsequent recombination events on a genetic backbone of
genotype C HBV infection. The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective RNA
virus requiring the presence of the HBV for the completion of its life cycle. The
origins of this virus remain unknown, although some recent studies have suggested
an ancient African radiation. The age of the association between HDV and HBV is
also unknown.

Hallmarks of the hepadnavirus replication cycle are the formation of covalently
closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and the reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA
(pgRNA) in core particles leading to synthesis of the relaxed circular DNA
(rcDNA) genome. cccDNA, the template for viral RNA transcription, is the basis
for the persistence of these viruses in infected hepatocytes. In this review, we 
summarize the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms of hepadnavirus
reverse transcription and the biochemical and structural properties of the viral 
reverse transcriptase (RT). We highlight important gaps in knowledge regarding
cccDNA biosynthesis and stability. In addition, we discuss the impact of current 
antiviral therapies on viral persistence, particularly on cccDNA.

Animal models and the molecular biology of hepadnavirus infection.

Australian antigen, the envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), was
discovered in 1967 as a prevalent serum antigen in hepatitis B patients. Early
electron microscopy (EM) studies showed that this antigen was present in 22-nm
particles in patient sera, which were believed to be incomplete virus. Complete
virus, much less abundant than the 22-nm particles, was finally visualized in
1970. HBV was soon found to infect chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbon
apes, and, more recently, tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) and cynomolgus macaques 
(Macaca fascicularis). This restricted host range placed limits on the kinds of
studies that might be performed to better understand the biology and molecular
biology of HBV and to develop antiviral therapies to treat chronic infections.
About 10 years after the discovery of HBV, this problem was bypassed with the
discovery of viruses related to HBV in woodchucks, ground squirrels, and ducks.
Although unlikely animal models, their use revealed the key steps in hepadnavirus
replication and in the host response to infection, including the fact that the
viral nuclear episome is the ultimate target for immune clearance of transient
infections and antiviral therapy of chronic infections. Studies with these and
other animal models have also suggested interesting clues into the link between
chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Genotypes and genetic variability of hepatitis B virus.

Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand,

Sequence heterogeneity is a feature of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the prototype
member of the family Hepadnaviridae. Based on an intergroup divergence of greater
than 7.5% across the complete genome, HBV has been classified phylogenetically
into 9 genotypes, A-I, with a putative 10th genotype 'J', isolated from a single 
individual. With between approximately 4 and 8% intergroup nucleotide divergence 
across the complete genome and good bootstrap support, genotypes A-D, F, H, and I
are classified further into subgenotypes. There is a broad and highly
statistically significant correlation between serological subtypes and genotypes,
and in some cases, serological subtypes can be used to differentiate
subgenotypes. The genotypes, and certain subgenotypes, have distinct geographical
distributions and are important in both the clinical manifestation of infection
and response to antiviral therapy. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and genetic
variability of HBV are useful in epidemiological and transmission studies,
tracing human migrations, and in predicting the risk for the development of
severe liver disease and response to antiviral therapy. Moreover, knowledge of
the genotype/subgenotype is important in implementing preventative strategies.
Thus, it is crucial that new strains are correctly assigned to their respective
genotype/subgenotype and consistent, unambiguous, and generally accepted
nomenclature is utilized.

At least 600000 individuals worldwide annually die of hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-related diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), 
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many viral factors, such as viral load,
genotype, and specific viral mutations, are known to affect disease progression. 
HBV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading function, therefore, many 
HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, mutants, and recombinants emerge. Differences
between genotypes in response to antiviral treatment have been determined. To
date, 10 HBV genotypes, scattered across different geographical regions, have
been identified. For example, genotype A has a tendency for chronicity, whereas
viral mutations are frequently encountered in genotype C. Both chronicity and
mutation frequency are common in genotype D. LC and progression to HCC are more
commonly encountered with genotypes C and D than the other genotypes. Pathogenic 
differences between HBV genotypes explain disease intensity, progression to LC,
and HCC. In conclusion, genotype determination in CHB infection is important in
estimating disease progression and planning optimal antiviral treatment.

Globally, over 500 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B
virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These chronic infections cause liver
inflammation, and may result in fibrosis/cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.
Albeit that HBV and HCV differ in various aspects, clearance, persistence, and
immunopathology of either infection depends on the interplay between the innate
and adaptive responses in the liver. Kupffer cells, the liver-resident
macrophages, are abundantly present in the sinusoids of the liver. These cells
have been shown to be crucial players to maintain homeostasis, but also
contribute to pathology. However, it is important to note that especially during 
pathology, Kupffer cells are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating
monocytes/macrophages and other myeloid cells. In this review we discuss our
current understanding of Kupffer cells, and assess their role in the regulation
of anti-viral immunity and disease pathogenesis during HBV and HCV infection.
