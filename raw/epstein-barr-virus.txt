Technologies used for genome analysis and whole genome sequencing are useful for 
us to understand genomic characterization and divergence. The Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) is an oncogenic virus that causes diverse diseases such as Burkitt's
lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and
gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV genomes found in these diseases can be classified
either by phases of EBV latency (type-I, -II, and -III latency) or types of EBNA2
sequence difference (type-I EBV, type-II EBV or EBV-1, EBV-2). EBV from
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) establishes type-III latency, EBV 
from NPC establishes type-II latency, and EBV from GC establishes type-I latency.
However, other important factors play key roles in classifying numerous EBV
strains because EBV genomes are highly diverse and not phylogenetically related
to types of EBV-associated diseases. Herein, we first reviewed previous studies
to describe molecular characteristics of EBV genomes. Then, using comparative and
phylogenetic analyses, we phylogenetically analyzed molecular variations of EBV
genomes and proteins. The review of previous studies and our phylogenetic
analysis showed that EBV genomes and proteins were highly diverse regardless of
types of EBV-associated diseases. Other factors should be considered in
determining EBV taxonomy. This review will be helpful to understand complicated
phylogenetic relationships of EBV genomes.

BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis (PI) is an inflammatory reaction associated with
functional deterioration of supporting bones around the dental implant. Recent
studies suggested Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of
periodontitis. We investigated the association between EBV and Porphyromonas
gingivalis in Japanese PI patients.
METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy individuals, 15 healthy implant patients
and 15 PI patients were recruited. Forty five subgingival plaque samples were
collected from the deepest probing pocket depth (PPD) site from each patient.
Real-time PCR was used to detect EBV DNA and P. gingivalis.
RESULTS: EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in 7 and 3 PPD sites of the healthy 
controls, in 9 and 4 PPD sites of the healthy implants, and in 13 and 14 PPD
sites of the PI patients. P. gingivalis and coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis 
were detected significantly higher in the PI patients than healthy controls and
healthy implant patients. EBV was detected significantly higher in the PI
patients than healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of EBV and P. gingivalis were detected in PPD sites of
PI patients. These results suggest that coexistence of EBV and P. gingivalis may 
serve pathogenic factors cause for PI in Japanese dental patients.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus that infects most of the human
population. EBV infection is associated with multiple human cancers, including
Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, a subset of gastric carcinomas, and
almost all undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Intensive 
research has shown that EBV triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) during primary
infection and lytic reactivation. The EBV-encoded viral proteins have been
implicated in deregulating the DDR signaling pathways. The consequences of DDR
inactivation lead to genomic instability and promote cellular transformation.
This review summarizes the current understanding of the relationship between EBV 
infection and the DDR transducers, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated),
ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), and
discusses how EBV manipulates the DDR signaling pathways to complete the
replication process of viral DNA during lytic reactivation.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common pathogen in humans, is suspected as the cause 
of multiple pregnancy-related pathologies including depression, preeclampsia, and
stillbirth. Moreover, transmission of EBV through the placenta has been reported.
However, the focus of EBV infection within the placenta has remained unknown to
date. In this study, we proved the expression of latent EBV genes in the
endometrial glandular epithelial cells of the placenta and investigated the
cytological characteristics of these cells. Sixty-eight placentas were obtained
from pregnant women. Tissue microarray was constructed. EBV latent genes
including EBV-encoding RNA-1 (EBER1), Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1
(EBNA1), late membrane antigen (LMP1), and RPMS1 were detected with silver in
situ hybridization and/or mRNA in situ hybridization. Nuclear features of
EBV-positive cells in EBV-infected placenta were compared with those of
EBV-negative cells via image analysis. Sixteen placentas (23.5%) showed positive 
expression of all 4 EBV latent genes; only the glandular epithelial cells of the 
decidua showed EBV gene expression. EBV infection status was not significantly
correlated with maternal, fetal, or placental factors. The nuclei of EBV-positive
cells were significantly larger, longer, and round-shaped than those of
EBV-negative cells regardless of EBV-infection status of the placenta. For the
first time, evidence of EBV gene expression has been shown in placental tissues. 
Furthermore, we have characterized its cytological features, allowing screening
of EBV infection through microscopic examination.

Over 90% of the world's population is persistently infected with Epstein-Barr
virus. While EBV does not cause disease in most individuals, it is the common
cause of acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM) and has been associated with
several cancers and autoimmune diseases, highlighting a need for a preventive
vaccine. At present, very few primary, circulating EBV genomes have been
sequenced directly from infected individuals. While low levels of diversity and
low viral evolution rates have been predicted for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
viruses, recent studies have demonstrated appreciable diversity in common dsDNA
pathogens (e.g., cytomegalovirus). Here, we report 40 full-length EBV genome
sequences obtained from matched oral wash and B cell fractions from a cohort of
10 AIM patients. Both intra- and interpatient diversity were observed across the 
length of the entire viral genome. Diversity was most pronounced in viral genes
required for establishing latent infection and persistence, with appreciable
levels of diversity also detected in structural genes, including envelope
glycoproteins. Interestingly, intrapatient diversity declined significantly over 
time (P < 0.01), and this was particularly evident on comparison of viral genomes
sequenced from B cell fractions in early primary infection and convalescence (P <
0.001). B cell-associated viral genomes were observed to converge, becoming
nearly identical to the B95.8 reference genome over time (Spearman rank-order
correlation test; r = -0.5589, P = 0.0264). The reduction in diversity was most
marked in the EBV latency genes. In summary, our data suggest independent
convergence of diverse viral genome sequences toward a reference-like strain
within a relatively short period following primary EBV infection.IMPORTANCE
Identification of viral proteins with low variability and high immunogenicity is 
important for the development of a protective vaccine. Knowledge of genome
diversity within circulating viral populations is a key step in this process, as 
is the expansion of intrahost genomic variation during infection. We report
full-length EBV genomes sequenced from the blood and oral wash of 10 individuals 
early in primary infection and during convalescence. Our data demonstrate
considerable diversity within the pool of circulating EBV strains, as well as
within individual patients. Overall viral diversity decreased from early to
persistent infection, particularly in latently infected B cells, which serve as
the viral reservoir. Reduction in B cell-associated viral genome diversity
coincided with a convergence toward a reference-like EBV genotype. Greater
convergence positively correlated with time after infection, suggesting that the 
reference-like genome is the result of selection.

Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous virus and is associated with several human
malignances, including the significant subset of gastric carcinoma, Epstein-Barr 
virus-associated gastric carcinoma. Some Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases
are uniquely prevalent in populations with different geographic origins. However,
the features of the disease and geographically associated Epstein-Barr virus
genetic variation as well as the roles that the variation plays in carcinogenesis
and evolution remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we sequenced 95
geographically distinct Epstein-Barr virus isolates from Epstein-Barr
virus-associated gastric carcinoma biopsies and saliva of healthy donors to
detect variants and genes associated with gastric carcinoma and population
structure from a genome-wide spectrum. We demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus
revealed the population structure between North China and South China. In
addition, we observed population stratification between Epstein-Barr virus
strains from gastric carcinoma and healthy controls, indicating that certain
Epstein-Barr virus subtypes are associated with different gastric carcinoma
risks. We identified that the BRLF1, BBRF3, and BBLF2/BBLF3 genes had significant
associations with gastric carcinoma. LMP1 and BNLF2a genes were strongly
geographically associated genes in Epstein-Barr virus. Our study provides
insights into the genetic basis of oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus for gastric
carcinoma, and the genetic variants associated with gastric carcinoma can serve
as biomarkers for oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) miR-BHRF1 microRNA (miRNA) cluster has been shown to
facilitate B-cell transformation and promote the rapid growth of the resultant
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). However, we find that expression of
physiological levels of the miR-BHRF1 miRNAs in LCLs transformed with a miR-BHRF1
null mutant (∆123) fails to increase their growth rate. We demonstrate that the
pri-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 stem-loops are present in the 3'UTR of transcripts
encoding EBNA-LP and that excision of pre-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 by Drosha
destabilizes these mRNAs and reduces expression of the encoded protein.
Therefore, mutational inactivation of pri-miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 in the ∆123 mutant 
upregulates the expression of not only EBNA-LP but also EBNA-LP-regulated mRNAs
and proteins, including LMP1. We hypothesize that this overexpression causes the 
reduced transformation capacity of the ∆123 EBV mutant. Thus, in addition to
regulating cellular mRNAs in trans, miR-BHRF1-2 and 1-3 also regulate EBNA-LP
mRNA expression in cis.

Background: The 2 strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV type 1 (EBV-1) and
EBV-2, differ in latency genes, suggesting that they use distinct mechanisms to
establish latency. We previously reported that EBV-2 infects T cells in vitro. In
this study, we tested the possibility that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo.
Methods: Purified T-cell fractions isolated from children positive for EBV-1 or
EBV-2 and their mothers were examined for the presence of EBV and for EBV type.
Results: We detected EBV-2 in all T-cell samples obtained from EBV-2-infected
children at 12 months of age, with some children retaining EBV-2-positive T cells
through 24 months of age, suggesting that EBV-2 persists in T cells. We were
unable to detect EBV-2 in T-cell samples from mothers but could detect EBV-2 in
samples of their breast milk and saliva.
Conclusions: These data suggest that EBV-2 uses T cells as an additional latency 
reservoir but that, over time, the frequency of infected T cells may drop below
detectable levels. Alternatively, EBV-2 may establish a prolonged transient
infection in the T-cell compartment. Collectively, these novel findings
demonstrate that EBV-2 infects T cells in vivo and suggest EBV-2 may use the
T-cell compartment to establish latency.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen of humans that can cause
several types of lymphoma and carcinoma. Like other herpesviruses, EBV has
diversified through both coevolution with its host and genetic exchange between
virus strains. Sequence analysis of the EBV genome is unusually challenging
because of the large number and lengths of repeat regions within the virus. Here 
we describe the sequence assembly and analysis of the large internal repeat 1 of 
EBV (IR1; also known as the BamW repeats) for more than 70 strains. The diversity
of the latency protein EBV nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) resides
predominantly within the exons downstream of IR1. The integrity of the putative
BWRF1 open reading frame (ORF) is retained in over 80% of strains, and deletions 
truncating IR1 always spare BWRF1. Conserved regions include the IR1 latency
promoter (Wp) and one zone upstream of and two within BWRF1. IR1 is heterogeneous
in 70% of strains, and this heterogeneity arises from sequence exchange between
strains as well as from spontaneous mutation, with interstrain recombination
being more common in tumor-derived viruses. This genetic exchange often
incorporates regions of <1 kb, and allelic gene conversion changes the frequency 
of small regions within the repeat but not close to the flanks. These
observations suggest that IR1-and, by extension, EBV-diversifies through both
recombination and breakpoint repair, while concerted evolution of IR1 is driven
by gene conversion of small regions. Finally, the prototype EBV strain B95-8
contains four nonconsensus variants within a single IR1 repeat unit, including a 
stop codon in the EBNA-LP gene. Repairing IR1 improves EBNA-LP levels and the
quality of transformation by the B95-8 bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC).IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the majority of the world
population but causes illness in only a small minority of people. Nevertheless,
over 1% of cancers worldwide are attributable to EBV. Recent sequencing projects 
investigating virus diversity to see if different strains have different disease 
impacts have excluded regions of repeating sequence, as they are more technically
challenging. Here we analyze the sequence of the largest repeat in EBV (IR1). We 
first characterized the variations in protein sequences encoded across IR1. In
studying variations within the repeat of each strain, we identified a mutation in
the main laboratory strain of EBV that impairs virus function, and we suggest
that tumor-associated viruses may be more likely to contain DNA mixed from two
strains. The patterns of this mixing suggest that sequences can spread between
strains (and also within the repeat) by copying sequence from another strain (or 
repeat unit) to repair DNA damage.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that infects over 90 % of
adults. EBV is the primary etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is
closely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkin
lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Clinical serological assays for EBV diagnosis only
survey a small portion of the viral proteome, which does not represent the total 
antigenic breadth presented to the immune system during viral infection. In this 
study, we have generated an expression library containing the majority of EBV
ORFs, and have systematically evaluated IgG responses to those EBV proteins in
sera from EBV carriers. In addition to confirming previously recognized dominant 
EBV antigens, this study has identified additional immunodominant antigens, and
has revealed a more expansive antigenic profile of the humoral responses to EBV
in asymptomatic carriers. This EBV expression library will be deposited in a
public repository with the goal of disseminating this new research tool for the
application of identifying potential new biomarkers for EBV-associated diseases.

Like all herpesviruses, the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish
life-long persistent infections is related to a biphasic viral lifecycle that
involves latency and reactivation/lytic replication. Memory B cells serve as the 
EBV latency compartment where silencing of viral gene expression allows
maintenance of the viral genome, avoidance of immune surveillance, and life-long 
carriage. Upon viral reactivation, viral gene expression is induced for
replication, progeny virion production, and viral spread. EBV uses the host
epigenetic machinery to regulate its distinct viral gene expression states.
However, epigenetic manipulation by EBV affects the host epigenome by
reprogramming cells in ways that leave long-lasting, oncogenic phenotypes. Such
virally-induced epigenetic alterations are evident in EBV-associated cancers.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a recently
recognized disease entity defined by the presence of EBV in gastric carcinoma
cells. EBV infection causes major epigenetic alterations in the EBV genome and
its cellular host genome, suggesting that EBV acts as a direct epigenetic driver 
for EBVaGC. One of the major epigenetic events in the viral and cellular genomes 
to control transcription is DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation. Particularly, local
and global hypermethylation have been reported in EBVaGC. It is therefore
important to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA hypermethylation during
EBVaGC carcinogenesis. To understand the functional roles of DNA methylation and 
suggest therapeutic target candidates for EBVaGC, we reviewed recent literature
reporting DNA hypermethylation in EBVaGC. We summarized the identified candidate 
genes that are markedly hypermethylated in EBVaGC, which can potentially be
targets for chemotherapies with demethylating agents.

Viral gene sequences from an enlarged set of about 200 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
strains, including many primary isolates, have been used to investigate variation
in key viral genetic regions, particularly LMP1, Zp, gp350, EBNA1, and the BART
microRNA (miRNA) cluster 2. Determination of type 1 and type 2 EBV in saliva
samples from people from a wide range of geographic and ethnic backgrounds
demonstrates a small percentage of healthy white Caucasian British people
carrying predominantly type 2 EBV. Linkage of Zp and gp350 variants to type 2 EBV
is likely to be due to their genes being adjacent to the EBNA3 locus, which is
one of the major determinants of the type 1/type 2 distinction. A novel
classification of EBNA1 DNA binding domains, named QCIGP, results from phylogeny 
analysis of their protein sequences but is not linked to the type 1/type 2
classification. The BART cluster 2 miRNA region is classified into three major
variants through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the primary miRNA
outside the mature miRNA sequences. These SNPs can result in altered levels of
expression of some miRNAs from the BART variant frequently present in Chinese and
Indonesian nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) samples. The EBV genetic variants
identified here provide a basis for future, more directed analysis of association
of specific EBV variations with EBV biology and EBV-associated
diseases.IMPORTANCE Incidence of diseases associated with EBV varies greatly in
different parts of the world. Thus, relationships between EBV genome sequence
variation and health, disease, geography, and ethnicity of the host may be
important for understanding the role of EBV in diseases and for development of an
effective EBV vaccine. This paper provides the most comprehensive analysis so far
of variation in specific EBV genes relevant to these diseases and proposed EBV
vaccines. By focusing on variation in LMP1, Zp, gp350, EBNA1, and the BART miRNA 
cluster 2, new relationships with the known type 1/type 2 strains are
demonstrated, and a novel classification of EBNA1 and the BART miRNAs is
proposed.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects most of the world's population and is causally
associated with several human cancers, but little is known about how EBV genetic 
variations might influence EBV-associated diseases and their geographical
patterns. In the present study, 22 EBV whole-genome sequences from diseased and
healthy individuals were analysed to explore EBV sequence variations at the
whole-genome level. We found that the 22 EBV genomes were generally highly
similar to each other at the genome level. However, varying degrees of genetic
diversity were detected across the entire genome, especially in the latent genes.
In contrast, the sequences of promoters and non-coding RNAs were strictly
conserved. These findings suggested that both latent genes and non-coding RNAs
play important roles in the EBV life cycle. When we investigated changes in known
T-cell epitopes in some latent and lytic proteins, we observed that some T-cell
epitopes were changed, while others were conserved. These findings indicate that 
the effect of EBV variations in protein sequences that seem to have been selected
by the host immune system should be considered when conducting EBV-targeted
immunotherapy. Taken together, our results provide a global view of EBV genome
sequence variation, which not only is important for designing vaccines and
immunotherapy for EBV but also adds to the understanding of EBV biology and the
relationships between viral sequence variation and EBV-associated diseases.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to multiple acute, chronic and
malignant diseases. Detection of EBV-RNA transcripts in tissues or biofluids
besides EBV-DNA can help in diagnosing EBV related syndromes. Sensitive EBV
transcription profiling yields new insights on its pathogenic role and may be
useful for monitoring virus targeted therapy. Here we describe a multi-gene
quantitative RT-PCR profiling method that simultaneously detects a broad spectrum
(n=16) of crucial latent and lytic EBV transcripts. These transcripts include
(but are not restricted to), EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1, LMP2, BARTs, EBER1, BARF1 and
ZEBRA, Rta, BGLF4 (PK), BXLF1 (TK) and BFRF3 (VCAp18) all of which have been
implicated in EBV-driven oncogenesis and viral replication. With this method we
determine the amount of RNA copies per infected (tumor) cell in bulk populations 
of various origin. While we confirm the expected RNA profiles within classic EBV 
latency programs, this sensitive quantitative approach revealed the presence of
rare cells undergoing lytic replication. Inducing lytic replication in EBV tumor 
cells supports apoptosis and is considered as therapeutic approach to treat
EBV-driven malignancies. This sensitive multi-primed quantitative RT-PCR approach
can provide broader understanding of transcriptional activity in latent and lytic
EBV infection and is suitable for monitoring virus-specific therapy responses in 
patients with EBV associated cancers.

Epstein-Barr virus infection and related hematological diseases.

[Article in Japanese]

Sawada A(1).

and Child Health.

Once the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has infected a person, it then latently infects
B cells. This latent infection lasts a lifetime. However, EBV can infect T or NK 
cells (T/NK cells) in rare cases. Therefore, EBV causes various hematological
diseases. Among these diseases, CAEBV is regarded as the most problematic
because, although it is not particularly uncommon, the diagnostic tests for this 
disease are not covered by health insurance, a serious illness in the
"non-active" periods is lacking, and the appropriate motivation for early
initiation of treatment can easily be lost. However, the symptoms may suddenly
change; and if the manifestations are resistant when such exacerbation occurs,
CAEBC is potentially lethal. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) is the only cure. Once the diagnosis has been made, earlier treatment
initiation, safer bridging to allogeneic HSCT with multi-drug chemotherapy, and
then, planned HSCT can be completed more safely and thereby achieve a better
outcome.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To report the clinical presentation, treatment, and
management outcomes of patients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous
ulcer (EBVMCU) of the head and neck, which is a newly characterized pathologic
entity with aggressive morphology but follows an indolent, self-limiting clinical
course.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report and literature review.
METHODS: A case of EBVMCU of the base of tongue is reported and a retrospective
review of all cases of EBVMCU of the head and neck at a single academic
institution was conducted between January 1, 1986 and April 1, 2015. The MEDLINE 
database was additionally queried from January 1, 1950 to April 1, 2015 for all
reports of EBVMCU of the head and neck, and all pertinent clinical data were
extracted.
RESULTS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and response of a patient with
EBVMCU of the base of tongue are presented. Interim follow-up of the patient has 
revealed a complete remission with discontinuation of immunosuppression and
rituximab therapy. A review of the literature supports conservative management
and reduction of immunosuppression. Overall, 96.6% of patients with follow-up
greater than 2 months achieved complete remission with conservative management.
The current study is the largest series to report on the clinical presentation
and treatment outcomes of EBVMCU of the head and neck.
CONCLUSIONS: EBVMCU tends to follow an indolent and self-limiting clinical
course, responding to reduction of immunosuppression and conservative treatment. 
It is imperative for clinicians to consider EBVMCU in the differential diagnosis 
of mucocutaneous ulcers of the head and neck to avoid excessive treatment.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latently infects the majority of the human population
and is implicated as a causal or contributory factor in numerous diseases. We
sequenced 27 complete EBV genomes from a cohort of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
patients and healthy controls from Italy, although no variants showed a
statistically significant association with MS. Taking advantage of the
availability of ∼130 EBV genomes with known geographical origins, we reveal a
striking geographic distribution of EBV sub-populations with distinct allele
frequency distributions. We discuss mechanisms that potentially explain these
observations, and their implications for understanding the association of EBV
with human disease.

In order to develop novel host/pathogen real-time PCR assays for routine
diagnostic use, early gene expression patterns from both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
and Raji cells were examined after inducing the lytic life cycle using
12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol ester and sodium butyrate. Real-time PCR identified
several highly induced (>90-fold) EBV lytic genes over a 48 h time course during 
the lytic induction phase. Latent genes were induced at low levels during this
phase. The cellular response to lytic viral replication is poorly understood.
Whole human genome microarray analysis identified 113 cellular genes regulated
twofold or more by EBV, including 63 upregulated and 46 downregulated genes, over
a 24 h time course post-induction. The most upregulated gene was CHI3L1, a
chitinase-3-like 1 protein (18.1-fold; P<0.0084), and the most downregulated gene
was TYMS, a thymidylate synthetase (-7.6-fold). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
using MetaCore software revealed cell cycle (core), cell cycle (role of
anaphase-promoting complex) in cell cycle regulation) and lymphatic diseases as
the most significantly represented biological network processes, canonical
pathways and disease biomarkers, respectively. Chemotaxis, DNA damage and
inflammation (IL-4 signalling) together with lymphoproliferative disorders and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were significantly represented biological processes and
disease biomarkers.

Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a human γ-herpesvirus that was discovered in
Burkitt's lymphoma more than 50 years ago. Since then it has been proposed as the
causative agent of up to 2% of all tumors worldwide, mainly lymphomas and
epithelial cell carcinomas. Surprisingly, persistent EBV infection is at the same
time found in more than 90% of healthy human adults. Even the very same programs 
of EBV infection that are found in the associated malignancies are continuously
present in healthy EBV carriers. We will discuss primary immunodeficiencies and
immune compartment changes during the first decade of human life that give us
insights into how tumorigenesis by persistent EBV infection and Hodgkin's
lymphoma predisposing infectious mononucleosis is prevented during primary
infection. These insights should allow identifying individuals at risk to develop
EBV associated malignancies, who would benefit from EBV specific vaccination.

The intrinsic properties of different viruses have driven their study. For
example, the capacity for efficient productive infection of cultured cells by
herpes simplex virus 1 has made it a paradigm for this mode of infection for
herpesviruses in general. Epstein-Barr virus, another herpesvirus, has two
properties that have driven its study: It causes human cancers, and it exhibits a
tractable transition from its latent to its productive cycle in cell culture.
Here, we review our understanding of the path Epstein-Barr virus follows to move 
from a latent infection to and through its productive cycle. We use information
from human infections to provide a framework for describing studies in cell
culture and, where possible, the molecular resolutions from these studies. We
also pose questions whose answers we think are pivotal to understanding this
path, and we provide answers where we can.

Epstein-Barr virus is (EBV) a ubiquitous virus prevalent in 90% of the human
population. Transmitted through infected saliva, EBV is the causative agent of
infectious mononucleosis (IM) and is further implicated in malignancies of
lymphoid and epithelial origins. In the past few decades, research efforts
primarily focused on dissecting the mechanism of EBV-induced oncogenesis. Here,
we present an alternate facet of the oncovirus EBV, on its applications in
research and therapy. Finally, discussions on the prospective utilization of EBV 
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) diagnosis and therapy will also be presented.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays important roles in the origin and the progression 
of human carcinomas, e.g. diffuse large B cell tumors, T cell lymphomas, etc.
Discovering EBV targeted human genes and signaling pathways is vital to
understand EBV tumorigenesis. In this study we propose a noise-tolerant homolog
knowledge transfer method to reconstruct functional protein-protein interactions 
(PPI) networks between Epstein-Barr virus and Homo sapiens. The training set is
augmented via homolog instances and the homolog noise is counteracted by support 
vector machine (SVM). Additionally we propose two methods to define subcellular
co-localization (i.e. stringent and relaxed), based on which to further derive
physical PPI networks. Computational results show that the proposed method
achieves sound performance of cross validation and independent test. In the space
of 648,672 EBV-human protein pairs, we obtain 51,485 functional interactions
(7.94%), 869 stringent physical PPIs and 46,050 relaxed physical PPIs.
Fifty-eight evidences are found from the latest database and recent literature to
validate the model. This study reveals that Epstein-Barr virus interferes with
normal human cell life, such as cholesterol homeostasis, blood coagulation, EGFR 
binding, p53 binding, Notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, etc. The proteome-wide
predictions are provided in the supplementary file for further biomedical
research.

The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is associated with the development of several
diseases, including infectious mononucleosis (IM), Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL),
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, and other neoplasias. The publication of EBV genome
1984 led to several studies regarding the identification of different viral
strains. Currently, EBV is divided into EBV type 1 (B95-8 strain) and EBV type 2 
(AG876 strain), also known as type A and type B, which have been distinguished
based upon genetic differences in the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens (EBNAs)
sequence. Several other EBV strains have been described in the past 10 years
considering variations on EBV genome, and many have attempted to clarify if these
variations are ethnic or geographically correlated, or if they are disease
related. Indeed, there is an increasing interest to describe possible specific
disease associations, with emphasis on different malignancies. These studies aim 
to clarify if these variations are ethnic or geographically correlated, or if
they are disease related, thus being important to characterize the epidemiologic 
genetic distribution of EBV strains on our population. Here, we review the
current knowledge on the different EBV strains and variants and its association
with different diseases. J. Med. Virol. 89:373-387, 2017. © 2016 Wiley

Epstein-Barr Virus.

Nowalk A, Green M.

This review covers relevant clinical and laboratory information relating to
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in immunocompromised hosts. It describes the 
epidemiology and clinical manifestations with a primary focus on disease in solid
organ and stem cell transplant recipients. The review pays particular attention
to diagnostic approaches, including serologic testing and imaging, with an
expanded discussion on the role of measuring the EBV load in peripheral blood,
identifying both strengths and limitations of this assay. Additional attention is
paid to potential additional strategies of immunologic monitoring that may
enhance the performance of EBV load monitoring.

Epstein-Barr Virus and Gastric Cancer Risk: A Meta-analysis With Meta-regression 
of Case-control Studies.

Bae JM(1), Kim EH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Preventive Medicine, Jeju National University School of
Medicine, Jeju, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Research on how the risk of gastric cancer increases with
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is lacking. In a systematic review that
investigated studies published until September 2014, the authors did not
calculate the summary odds ratio (SOR) due to heterogeneity across studies.
Therefore, we include here additional studies published until October 2015 and
conduct a meta-analysis with meta-regression that controls for the heterogeneity 
among studies.
METHODS: Using the studies selected in the previously published systematic
review, we formulated lists of references, cited articles, and related articles
provided by PubMed. From the lists, only case-control studies that detected EBV
in tissue samples were selected. In order to control for the heterogeneity among 
studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed.
RESULTS: In the 33 case-control results with adjacent non-cancer tissue, the
total number of test samples in the case and control groups was 5280 and 4962,
respectively. In the 14 case-control results with normal tissue, the total number
of test samples in case and control groups was 1393 and 945, respectively. Upon
meta-regression, the type of control tissue was found to be a statistically
significant variable with regard to heterogeneity. When the control tissue was
normal tissue of healthy individuals, the SOR was 3.41 (95% CI, 1.78 to 6.51;
I-squared, 65.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the argument that EBV
infection increases the risk of gastric cancer. In the future, age-matched and
sex-matched case-control studies should be conducted.

OBJECTIVE: Clarify the frequency and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the
rare manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus infection.
SOURCES: Original research studies published in English between 1985 and 2015
were selected through a computer-assisted literature search (PubMed and Scopus). 
Computer searches used combinations of key words relating to "EBV infections" and
"atypical manifestation."
SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Epstein-Barr virus is a herpes virus responsible for a
lifelong latent infection in almost every adult. The primary infection concerns
mostly children and presents with the clinical syndrome of infectious
mononucleosis. However, Epstein-Barr virus infection may exhibit numerous rare,
atypical and threatening manifestations. It may cause secondary infections and
various complications of the respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary,
gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Epstein-Barr virus also plays a
significant role in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and
neoplasms, with Burkitt lymphoma as the main representative of the latter. The
mechanisms of these manifestations are still unresolved. Therefore, the main
suggestions are direct viral invasion and chronic immune response due to the
reactivation of the latent state of the virus, or even various DNA mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be cautious about uncommon presentations of the
viral infection and consider EBV as a causative agent when they encounter similar
clinical pictures.

The Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein complex gMgN has been implicated in assembly 
and release of fully enveloped virus, although the precise role that it plays has
not been elucidated. We report here that the long predicted cytoplasmic tail of
gM is not required for complex formation and that it interacts with the cellular 
protein p32, which has been reported to be involved in nuclear egress of human
cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Although redistribution of p32 and
colocalization with gM was not observed in virus infected cells, knockdown of p32
expression by siRNA or lentivirus-delivered shRNA recapitulated the phenotype of 
a virus lacking expression of gNgM. A proportion of virus released from cells
sedimented with characteristics of virus lacking an intact envelope and there was
an increase in virus trapped in nuclear condensed chromatin. The observations
suggest the possibility that p32 may also be involved in nuclear egress of
Epstein-Barr virus.

Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) is widespread within the human population with over 90%
of adults being infected. In response to primary EBV infection, the host mounts
an antiviral immune response comprising both innate and adaptive effector
functions. Although the immune system can control EBV infection to a large
extent, the virus is not cleared. Instead, EBV establishes a latent infection in 
B lymphocytes characterized by limited viral gene expression. For the production 
of new viral progeny, EBV reactivates from these latently infected cells. During 
the productive phase of infection, a repertoire of over 80 EBV gene products is
expressed, presenting a vast number of viral antigens to the primed immune
system. In particular the EBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T lymphocytes can
respond within hours, potentially destroying the virus-producing cells before
viral replication is completed and viral particles have been released. Preceding 
the adaptive immune response, potent innate immune mechanisms provide a first
line of defense during primary and recurrent infections. In spite of this broad
range of antiviral immune effector mechanisms, EBV persists for life and
continues to replicate. Studies performed over the past decades have revealed a
wide array of viral gene products interfering with both innate and adaptive
immunity. These include EBV-encoded proteins as well as small noncoding RNAs with
immune-evasive properties. The current review presents an overview of the evasion
strategies that are employed by EBV to facilitate immune escape during latency
and productive infection. These evasion mechanisms may also compromise the
elimination of EBV-transformed cells, and thus contribute to malignancies
associated with EBV infection.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widely distributed in the world and associated with a
still increasing number of acute, chronic, malignant and autoimmune disease
syndromes. Humoral immune responses to EBV have been studied for diagnostic,
pathogenic and protective (vaccine) purposes. These studies use a range of
methodologies, from cell-based immunofluorescence testing to antibody-diversity
analysis using immunoblot and epitope analysis using recombinant or synthetic
peptide-scanning. First, the individual EBV antigen complexes (VCA , MA, EA(D),
EA(R) and EBNA) are defined at cellular and molecular levels, providing a
historic overview. The characteristic antibody responses to these complexes in
health and disease are described, and differences are highlighted by clinical
examples. Options for EBV vaccination are briefly addressed. For a selected
number of immunodominant proteins, in particular EBNA1, the interaction with
human antibodies is further detailed at the epitope level, revealing interesting 
insights for structure, function and immunological aspects, not considered
previously. Humoral immune responses against EBV-encoded tumour antigens LMP1,
LMP2 and BARF1 are addressed, which provide novel options for targeted
immunotherapy. Finally, some considerations on EBV-linked autoimmune diseases are
given, and mechanisms of antigen mimicry are briefly discussed. Further analysis 
of humoral immune responses against EBV in health and disease in carefully
selected patient cohorts will open new options for understanding pathogenesis of 
individual EBV-linked diseases and developing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches.

Epstein-Barr virus, which mainly infects B cells and epithelial cells, has two
modes of infection: latent and lytic. Epstein-Barr virus infection is
predominantly latent; however, lytic infection is detected in healthy
seropositive individuals and becomes more prominent in certain pathological
conditions. Lytic infection is divided into several stages: early gene
expression, DNA replication, late gene expression, assembly, and egress. This
chapter summarizes the most recent progress made toward understanding the
molecular mechanisms that regulate the different lytic stages leading to
production of viral progeny. In addition, the chapter highlights the potential
role of lytic infection in disease development and current attempts to purposely 
induce lytic infection as a therapeutic approach.

The morphology of the pathognomonic Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS) of
Hodgkin lymphoma was described over a century ago, yet it was only relatively
recently that the B-cell origin of these cells was identified. In a proportion of
cases, HRS cells harbour monoclonal forms of the B lymphotropic Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV). This review summarises current knowledge of the pathogenesis of
Hodgkin lymphoma with a particular emphasis on the contribution of EBV.

The Epstein-Barr virus is etiologically linked with the development of benign and
malignant diseases, characterized by their diversity and a heterogeneous
geographic distribution across the world. The virus possesses a 170-kb-large
genome that encodes for multiple proteins and non-coding RNAs. Early on there
have been numerous attempts to link particular diseases with particular EBV
strains, or at least with viral genetic polymorphisms. This has given rise to a
wealth of information whose value has been difficult to evaluate for at least
four reasons. First, most studies have looked only at one particular gene and
missed the global picture. Second, they usually have not studied sufficient
numbers of diseased and control cases to reach robust statistical significance.
Third, the functional significance of most polymorphisms has remained unclear,
although there are exceptions such as the 30-bp deletion in LMP1. Fourth,
different biological properties of the virus do not necessarily equate with a
different pathogenicity. This was best illustrated by the type 1 and type 2
viruses that markedly differ in terms of their transformation abilities, yet do
not seem to cause different diseases. Reciprocally, environmental and genetic
factors in the host are likely to influence the outcome of infections with the
same virus type. However, with recent developments in recombinant virus
technology and in the availability of high throughput sequencing, the tide is now
turning. The availability of 23 complete or nearly complete genomes has led to
the recognition of viral subtypes, some of which possess nearly identical
genotypes. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that some genetic polymorphisms
among EBV strains markedly influence the biological and clinical behavior of the 
virus. Some virus strains are endowed with biological properties that explain
crucial clinical features of patients with EBV-associated diseases. Although we
now have a better overview of the genetic diversity within EBV genomes, it has
also become clear that defining phenotypic traits evinced by cells infected by
different viruses usually result from the combination of multiple polymorphisms
that will be difficult to identify in their entirety. However, the steadily
increasing number of sequenced EBV genomes and cloned EBV BACS from diseased and 
healthy patients will facilitate the identification of the key polymorphisms that
condition the biological and clinical behavior of the viruses. This will allow
the development of preventative and therapeutic approaches against highly
pathogenic viral strains.

Ever since the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) more than 50 years ago, this
virus has been studied for its capacity to readily establish a latent infection, 
which is the prominent hallmark of this member of the herpesvirus family. EBV has
become an important model for many aspects of herpesviral latency, but the
molecular steps and mechanisms that lead to and promote viral latency have only
emerged recently. It now appears that the virus exploits diverse facets of
epigenetic gene regulation in the cellular host to establish a latent infection. 
Most viral genes are transcriptionally repressed, and viral chromatin is densely 
compacted during EBV's latent phase, but latent infection is not a dead end. In
order to escape from this phase, epigenetic silencing must be reverted
efficiently and quickly. It appears that EBV has perfected a clever strategy to
overcome transcriptional repression of its many lytic genes to initiate virus de 
novo synthesis within a few hours after induction of its lytic cycle. This review
tries to summarize the known molecular mechanisms, the current models, concepts, 
and ideas underlying this viral strategy. This review also attempts to identify
and address gaps in our current understanding of EBV's epigenetic mechanisms
within the infected cellular host.

What is wild-type Epstein-Barr virus and are there genetic differences in EBV
strains that contribute to some of the EBV-associated diseases? Recent progress
in DNA sequencing has resulted in many new Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome
sequences becoming available. EBV isolates worldwide can be grouped into type 1
and type 2, a classification based on the EBNA2 gene sequence. Type 1 transforms 
human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines much more efficiently than type 2
EBV and molecular mechanisms that may account for this difference in cell
transformation are now becoming understood. Study of geographic variation of EBV 
strains independent of the type 1/type 2 classification and systematic
investigation of the relationship between viral strains, infection and disease
are now becoming possible. So we should consider more directly whether viral
sequence variation might play a role in the incidence of some EBV-associated
diseases.

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known as an oncogenic herpesvirus implicated in the
pathogenesis of various malignancies. It has been reported that EBV non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) including EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and EBV-miRNAs contribute 
to viral pathogenesis. EBERs that are expressed abundantly in latently
EBV-infected cells have been reported to play significant roles in tumorigenesis 
by EBV. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the modulation of host innate
immune signals by EBERs contributes to EBV-mediated pathogenesis including
oncogenesis. Recently it was demonstrated that EBERs are secreted via exosomes by
EBV-infected cells. It was also demonstrated that exosomes contain a number of
EBV-encoded miRNAs. Various mRNAs have been identified as targets for regulation 
by EBV-miRNAs in host cells, therefore, EBERs and EBV-miRNAs might function
through the transfer of exosomes.

Epstein Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus to be described. Despite
its discovery now more than fifty years ago, immune control of this virus is
still not very well understood and no vaccine is available. This knowledge gap is
due in part to the lack of a preclinical small animal model which can faithfully 
recapitulate EBV infection and immune control, and would allow testing of EBV
specific vaccine candidates. With the advent of mice with reconstituted human
immune system compartments (HIS mice) during the past decade this is changing. We
will discuss which aspects of EBV infection and its immune control can already be
modeled in HIS mice, and which shortcomings still need to be overcome in order to
recapitulate the immunobiology of oncogenic EBV infection.

Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative processes occur in the head 
and neck ranging from reactive processes such as infectious mononucleosis to high
grade malignant lymphomas. EBV is a ubiquitous herpes virus that infects more
than 90% of adults worldwide, and is generally transferred though saliva. Primary
infection can occur throughout life. EBV is the first virus linked to
malignancies, both epithelial and lymphoid. Both T and B cell lymphomas can be
associated with EBV and evidence shows that an individual's response to the acute
EBV infection may be critical in the development of subsequent lymphoma.
Currently, in situ hybridization for EBER is the most sensitive available test to
detect EBV and should be routinely performed in lymphoproliferative lesions of
the head and neck. Immunohistochemistry for EBV related proteins, such as LMP1,
is much less sensitive than EBER in situ hybridization, but can help determine
latency patterns of EBV infection. Although relatively rare, primary EBV-related 
lymphomas must be considered in the differential of atypical lymphoid
proliferations in the head and neck. We present selected EBV-related disorders of
the head and neck discussing etiology as well as differential diagnosis.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is usually acquired silently early in life and carried
thereafter as an asymptomatic infection of the B lymphoid system. However, many
circumstances disturb the delicate EBV-host balance and cause the virus to
display its pathogenic potential. Thus, primary infection in adolescence can
manifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM), as a fatal illness that magnifies the 
immunopathology of IM in boys with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
trait, and as a chronic active disease leading to life-threatening
hemophagocytosis in rare cases of T or natural killer (NK) cell infection.
Patients with primary immunodeficiencies affecting the NK and/or T cell systems, 
as well as immunosuppressed transplant recipients, handle EBV infections poorly, 
and many are at increased risk of virus-driven B-lymphoproliferative disease. By 
contrast, a range of other EBV-positive malignancies of lymphoid or epithelial
origin arise in individuals with seemingly intact immune systems through
mechanisms that remain to be understood.

Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is present in the malignant
Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of a proportion of cases of classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL), how the virus contributes to the pathogenesis of this disease
remains poorly defined. It is clear from the studies of other EBV-associated
cancers that the virus is usually not sufficient for tumor development and that
other oncogenic co-factors are required. This article reviews what is known about
the contribution of EBV to the pathogenesis of cHL and focuses on emerging
evidence implicating chronic inflammation as a potential oncogenic co-factor in
this malignancy.

The special November and December issues of the Chinese Journal of Cancer
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with 
a series of reviews covering the association of the virus with various cancers,
with special emphasis on the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal
cancer (NPC). The restricted geographic prevalence of NPC along with the tumor's 
consistent association with EBV infection has fascinated scientists and
clinicians ever since it was first suggested in 1966. As in all cancers, NPC
development reflects the complex interplay between host genes and environmental
factors, but the essential role of EBV infection provides important insight into 
the etiology of this tumor. Indeed, it is this understanding that is now
translating into exciting diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.

The role of Epstein-Barr virus in epithelial malignancies.

Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.

The close association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with non-keratinizing
nasopharyngeal carcinomas and a subset of gastric carcinomas suggests that EBV
infection is a crucial event in these cancers. The difficulties encountered in
infecting and transforming primary epithelial cells in experimental systems
suggest that the role of EBV in epithelial malignancies is complex and
multifactorial in nature. Genetic alterations in the premalignant epithelium may 
support the establishment of latent EBV infection, which is believed to be an
initiation event. Oncogenic properties have been reported in multiple EBV latent 
genes. The BamH1 A rightwards transcripts (BARTs) and the BART-encoded microRNAs 
(miR-BARTs) are highly expressed in EBV-associated epithelial malignancies and
may induce malignant transformation. However, enhanced proliferation may not be
the crucial function of EBV infection in epithelial malignancies, at least in the
early stages of cancer development. EBV-encoded gene products may confer
anti-apoptotic properties and promote the survival of infected premalignant
epithelial cells harbouring genetic alterations. Multiple EBV-encoded microRNAs
have been reported to have immune evasion functions. Genetic alterations in host 
cells, as well as inflammatory stroma, could modulate the expression of EBV genes
and alter the growth properties of infected premalignant epithelial cells,
encouraging their selection during carcinogenesis.

The Epstein-Barr virus encodes at least 44 microRNAs that are grouped in two
clusters located around the BHRF1 gene and within the BART transcript. The
expression pattern of these microRNAs both depends on the lineage of the infected
cells and on the type of viral latency. Whilst BART microRNAs are expressed in
all EBV-infected tumors, the BHRF1 locus is nearly exclusively expressed in cells
that display a type III latency. However, the BART microRNA expression level is
several orders of magnitude higher in epithelial cells than in B cells. Genetic
studies have demonstrated that the BHRF1 microRNA cluster enhances the initial
phases of primary B cell transformation through inhibition of apoptosis. A
similar role has been ascribed to the BART microRNAs although their contribution 
to this process seems more limited. These microRNAs also enhance the survival of 
B cell lymphoma cells. Using various strategies including high throughput assays,
several groups have identified mRNAs targeted by the EBV microRNAs. Here we
compare the results of the published high throughput screens and review the viral
and cellular genes thought to represent high confidence targets for the EBV
microRNAs. Although genetic studies allow unequivocal evaluation of the functions
served by the microRNAs, only a few key targets have been identified so far.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous double-stranded DNA gamma herpes virus
and it is present in 95% of adults. EBV infection is seen in many oncological
conditions, although there is controversy regarding whether EBV is causative, a
cofactor, or just a coincidental infection. Some of these conditions involve the 
skin as the main or as a secondary organ. In this report, we review several
tumoral and nontumoral cutaneous conditions, which are related to EBV infection, 
and describe the epidemiology of infection and the life cycle of the virus.

The pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus persistent infection.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) maintains a lifelong infection. According to the
germinal center model (GCM), latently infected B cells transit the germinal
center (GC) to become resting memory cells. Here, the virus resides quiescently, 
occasionally reactivating to infect new B cells, completing the cycle of
infection. The GCM remains the only model that explains EBV biology and the
pathogenesis of lymphoma. Recent work suggests modifications to the model notably
that the virus contributes only modestly to the GC process and predictions from
mathematical models that quiescence within memory B cells shapes the overall
structure of viral infection but is not essential for persistence. Rather, it is 
the cycle of infection which allows viral persistence at the very low levels
observed.

EBER in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus.

Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization is the methodology of
choice for the detection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in tissue sections.
Because of the large numbers of copies of EBERs present in latently infected
cells, non-isotopic methods can be used. Positive studies show staining in the
nuclei of the EBV-infected cells, accentuating the chromatin and often excluding 
the nucleolus. False-negative results are most often the result of RNA
degradation in the tissues, a finding that may be detected through the use of a
polyT probe as a control for RNA preservation.

Epstein-Barr virus infection induces lupus autoimmunity.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is a systemic autoimmune disease
characterized by a constellation of varied clinical presentations, although the
nearly universal presence of autoantibodies is a salient unifying feature.
Ongoing research efforts focus on understanding the complex combination of
genetic and environmental factors that lead to SLE in select individuals. Our
previous work has demonstrated that years before diagnosis abnormal autoantibody 
responses are present in the sera of patients who will subsequently develop lupus
and, further, that the initial targets of two of these key responses (anti-Sm B' 
and anti-60 kD Ro alone) have been identified for some patients. Indeed, our
results suggest that the first lupus-specific autoantibodies arise from
particular antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus Nuclear Antigen-1
(EBNA-1) and that infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an environmental
risk factor for lupus. The predicted sequence of events is normal immunity,
followed by Epstein- Barr virus infection, the generation of anti-EBNA-1
antibodies, then followed by those particular anti-EBNA-1 antibodies that also
bind lupus-specific autoantigens (Sm or Ro), followed by the development of more 
complex autoimmune responses, and, finally, culminating in clinical disease.
Studies from others and those underway suggest that lupus patients have unusual
immune responses to Epstein-Barr virus. In aggregate, these results are
consistent with an immune response against Epstein-Barr virus being important in 
at least some patients for the initiation of lupus autoimmunity.

Since the initial report of unusual manifestations possibly associated with
chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (CAEBV), nearly three decades
have passed. During this period, reported cases with this entity have
dramatically increased in the world. Additionally, recent development of
diagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunological
techniques, have provided us with the ability to define certain diseases,
especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the current
literature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV are
proposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.

Epstein-Barr virus: exploiting the immune system.

Thorley-Lawson DA(1).

In vitro, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will infect any resting B cell, driving it out
of the resting state to become an activated proliferating lymphoblast.
Paradoxically, EBV persists in vivo in a quiescent state in resting memory B
cells that circulate in the peripheral blood. How does the virus get there, and
with such specificity for the memory compartment? An explanation comes from the
idea that two genes encoded by the virus--LMP1 and LMP2A--allow EBV to exploit
the normal pathways of B-cell differentiation so that the EBV-infected B blast
can become a resting memory cell.
