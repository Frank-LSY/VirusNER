Human myxovirus resistance protein B (hMXB) is a restriction factor of HIV-1 that
also inhibits a variety of retroviruses. However, hMXB is not antiviral against
equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). We show here that equine MX2 (eMX2)
potently restricts EIAV in vitro. Additionally, eMX2 inhibits HIV-1 and other
lentiviruses, including murine leukemia virus. Previously, it was reported that
hMXB repression is reduced in hMXB Δ1-25, but not in GTP-binding mutant K131A and
GTP-hydrolysis mutant T151A. In contrast to this phenomenon, our study indicates 
that eMX2 restriction is not diminished in eMX2 Δ1-25, but is in eMX2 K127A and
T147A, which correspond to hMXB K131A and T151A, respectively. Thus, eMX2 may
inhibit retroviral replication by a novel mechanism that differs from that of
hMXB.

Spumaretroviruses, commonly referred to as foamy viruses, are complex
retroviruses belonging to the subfamily Spumaretrovirinae, family Retroviridae,
which naturally infect a variety of animals including nonhuman primates (NHPs).
Additionally, cross-species transmissions of simian foamy viruses (SFVs) to
humans have occurred following exposure to tissues of infected NHPs. Recent
research has led to the identification of previously unknown exogenous foamy
viruses, and to the discovery of endogenous spumaretrovirus sequences in a
variety of host genomes. Here, we describe an updated spumaretrovirus taxonomy
that has been recently accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) Executive Committee, and describe a virus nomenclature that is
generally consistent with that used for other retroviruses, such as lentiviruses 
and deltaretroviruses. This taxonomy can be applied to distinguish different, but
closely related, primate (e.g., human, ape, simian) foamy viruses as well as
those from other hosts. This proposal accounts for host-virus co-speciation and
cross-species transmission.

The HIV-1 RNA genome contains complex structures with many structural elements
playing regulatory roles during viral replication. A recent study has identified 
multiple RNA structures with unknown functions that are conserved among HIV-1 and
two simian immunodeficiency viruses. To explore the roles of these conserved RNA 
structures, we introduced synonymous mutations into the HIV-1 genome to disrupt
each structure. These mutants exhibited similar particle production, viral
infectivity, and replication kinetics relative to the parent NL4-3 virus.
However, when replicating in direct competition with the wild-type NL4-3 virus,
mutations of RNA structures at inter-protein domain junctions can cause fitness
defects. These findings reveal the ability of HIV-1 to tolerate changes in its
sequences, even in apparently highly conserved structures, which permits high
genetic diversity in HIV-1 population. Our results also suggest that some
conserved RNA structures may function to fine-tune viral replication.

Mitochondria play important roles in multiple aspects of viral tumorigenesis.
Mitochondrial genomes contribute to the host's genetic background. After viruses 
enter the cell, they modulate mitochondrial function and thus alter bioenergetics
and retrograde signaling pathways. At the same time, mitochondria also regulate
and mediate viral oncogenesis. In this context, oncogenesis by oncoviruses like
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human papilloma virus (HPV),
Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will be
discussed.

Lentiviral vectors (LVs)-mediated gene transfer is an efficient method for ex
vivo and in vivo gene therapy. Actually, LVs have been used in several clinical
trials and therapeutic correction was reached in affected patients. However, in
order to be effective gene therapy needs to be efficient without detrimental
effects for target cells. Successful cell transduction by LVs can be hampered by 
several factors such as the activation of innate immune sensors during cell
transduction and different restriction factors (RFs) inhibiting viral replication
inside the cells. Therefore, a better knowledge of host-vector interactions is
important for the development of more efficient gene therapy strategies improving
the LVs platform by limiting harmful responses.

Zoonotic transmission of simian retroviruses in West-Central Africa occurring in 
primate hunters has resulted in pandemic spread of human immunodeficiency viruses
(HIVs) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). While simian foamy virus (SFV)
and simian T- lymphotropic virus (STLV)-like infection were reported in healthy
persons exposed to nonhuman primates (NHPs) in West-Central Africa, less is known
about the distribution of these viruses in Western Africa and in hospitalized
populations. We serologically screened for SFV and STLV infection using 1,529
specimens collected between 1985 and 1997 from Côte d'Ivoire patients with high
HIV prevalence. PCR amplification and analysis of SFV, STLV, and HIV/SIV
sequences from PBMCs was used to investigate possible simian origin of infection.
We confirmed SFV antibodies in three persons (0.2%), two of whom were
HIV-1-infected. SFV polymerase (pol) and LTR sequences were detected in PBMC DNA 
available for one HIV-infected person. Phylogenetic comparisons with new SFV
sequences from African guenons showed infection likely originated from a
Chlorocebus sabaeus monkey endemic to Côte d'Ivoire. 4.6% of persons were HTLV
seropositive and PCR testing of PBMCs from 15 HTLV seroreactive persons
identified nine with HTLV-1 and one with HTLV-2 LTR sequences. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that two persons had STLV-1-like infections, seven were HTLV-1,
and one was an HTLV-2 infection. 310/858 (53%), 8/858 (0.93%), and 18/858 (2.1%) 
were HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-positive but undifferentiated by serology,
respectively. No SIV sequences were found in persons with HIV-2 antibodies (n =
1) or with undifferentiated HIV results (n = 7). We document SFV, STLV-1-like,
and dual SFV/HIV infection in Côte d'Ivoire expanding the geographic range for
zoonotic simian retrovirus transmission to West Africa. These findings highlight 
the need to define the public health consequences of these infections. Studying
dual HIV-1/SFV infections in immunocompromised populations may provide a new
opportunity to better understand SFV pathogenicity and transmissibility in
humans.

A fascinating aspect of retroviruses is their tendency to nonrandomly incorporate
host cell RNAs into virions. In addition to the specific tRNAs that prime reverse
transcription, all examined retroviruses selectively package multiple host cell
noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Many of these ncRNAs appear to be encapsidated shortly
after synthesis, before assembling with their normal protein partners.
Remarkably, although some packaged ncRNAs, such as pre-tRNAs and the spliceosomal
U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), were believed to reside exclusively within
mammalian nuclei, it was demonstrated recently that the model retrovirus murine
leukemia virus (MLV) packages these ncRNAs from a novel pathway in which unneeded
nascent ncRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for degradation. The finding that
retroviruses package forms of ncRNAs that are rare in cells suggests several
hypotheses for how these RNAs could assist retrovirus assembly and infectivity.
Moreover, recent experiments in several laboratories have identified additional
ways in which cellular ncRNAs may contribute to the retrovirus life cycle. This
review focuses on the ncRNAs that are packaged by retroviruses and the ways in
which both encapsidated ncRNAs and other cellular ncRNAs may contribute to
retrovirus replication.

Lentiviral (LV) vectors offer unique advantages over other gene delivery systems,
namely the ability to integrate transgenes into the genome of both dividing and
nondividing cells. Detailed herein is a simple protocol for the production LV
vectors, describing the triple transfection of an LV transfer vector and LV
helper plasmids into HEK-293 cells, and the subsequent purification of virions
from the cellular media. The current protocol is versatile, and can be easily
modified to fit the specific needs of the researcher in order to produce
relatively high-titer LV vectors which can be used to transduce a wide variety of
cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Different animal models have been proposed to investigate the mechanisms of Human
T-lymphotropic Virus (HTLV)-induced pathogenesis: rats, transgenic and
NOD-SCID/γcnull (NOG) mice, rabbits, squirrel monkeys, baboons and macaques.
These systems indeed provide useful information but have intrinsic limitations
such as lack of disease relevance, species specificity or inadequate immune
response. Another strategy based on a comparative virology approach is to
characterize a related pathogen and to speculate on possible shared mechanisms.
In this perspective, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), another member of the
deltaretrovirus genus, is evolutionary related to HTLV-1. BLV induces
lymphoproliferative disorders in ruminants providing useful information on the
mechanisms of viral persistence, genetic determinants of pathogenesis and
potential novel therapies.

Retroviruses are among the best studied viruses in last decades due to their
pivotal involvement in cellular processes and, most importantly, in causing human
diseases, most notably-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that is
triggered by human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2,
respectively). Numerous studied were conducted to understand the involvement of
the three cardinal retroviral enzymes, reverse transcriptase, integrase and
protease, in the life cycle of the viruses. These studies have led to the
development of many inhibitors of these enzymes as anti-retroviral specific drugs
that are used for routine treatments of HIV/AIDS patients. Interestingly, a
fourth virus-encoded enzyme, the deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase
(dUTPase) is also found in several major retroviral groups. The presence and the 
importance of this enzyme to the life cycle of retroviruses were usually
overlooked by most retrovirologists, although the occurrence of dUTPases,
particularly in beta-retroviruses and in non-primate retroviruses, is known for
more than 20 years. Only more recently, retroviral dUTPases were brought into the
limelight and were shown in several cases to be essential for viral replication. 
Therefore, it is likely that future studies on this enzyme will advance our
knowledge to a level that will allow designing novel, specific and potent
anti-dUTPase drugs that are effective in combating retroviral diseases. The aim
of this review is to give concise background information on dUTPases in general
and to summarize the most relevant data on retroviral dUTPases and their
involvement in the replication processes and pathogenicity of the viruses, as
well as in possibly-associated human diseases.

Models of viral population dynamics have contributed enormously to our
understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of several infectious
diseases, the coevolutionary dynamics of viruses and their hosts, the mechanisms 
of action of drugs, and the effectiveness of interventions. In this chapter, we
review major advances in the modeling of the population dynamics of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and briefly discuss adaptations to other viruses.

BACKGROUND: Retroviral integration favors weakly conserved palindrome sequences
at the sites of viral DNA joining and generates a short (4-6 bp) duplication of
host DNA flanking the provirus. We previously determined two key parameters that 
underlie the target DNA preference for prototype foamy virus (PFV) and human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration: flexible pyrimidine (Y)/purine
(R) dinucleotide steps at the centers of the integration sites, and base contacts
with specific integrase residues, such as Ala188 in PFV integrase and Ser119 in
HIV-1 integrase. Here we examined the dinucleotide preference profiles of a range
of retroviruses and correlated these findings with respect to length of target
site duplication (TSD).
RESULTS: Integration datasets covering six viral genera and the three lengths of 
TSD were accessed from the literature or generated in this work. All viruses
exhibited significant enrichments of flexible YR and/or selection against rigid
RY dinucleotide steps at the centers of integration sites, and the magnitude of
this enrichment inversely correlated with TSD length. The DNA sequence
environments of in vivo-generated HIV-1 and PFV sites were consistent with
integration into nucleosomes, however, the local sequence preferences were
largely independent of target DNA chromatinization. Integration sites derived
from cells infected with the gammaretrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A
(Rev-A), which yields a 5 bp TSD, revealed the targeting of global chromatin
features most similar to those of Moloney murine leukemia virus, which yields a 4
bp duplication. In vitro assays revealed that Rev-A integrase interacts with and 
is catalytically stimulated by cellular bromodomain containing 4 protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral integrases have likely evolved to bend target DNA to fit 
scissile phosphodiester bonds into two active sites for integration, and viruses 
that cut target DNA with a 6 bp stagger may not need to bend DNA as sharply as
viruses that cleave with 4 bp or 5 bp staggers. For PFV and HIV-1, the selection 
of signature bases and central flexibility at sites of integration is largely
independent of chromatin structure. Furthermore, global Rev-A integration is
likely directed to chromatin features by bromodomain and extraterminal domain
proteins.

For the past two decades, scientists from around the world, working on different 
aspects of foamy virus (FV) research, have gathered in different research
institutions almost every two years to present their recent results in formal
talks, to discuss their ongoing studies informally, and to initiate fruitful
collaborations. In this report we review the 2014 anniversary conference to share
the meeting summary with the virology community and hope to arouse interest by
other researchers to join this exciting field. The topics covered included
epidemiology, virus molecular biology, and immunology of FV infection in
non-human primates, cattle, and humans with zoonotic FV infections, as well as
recent findings on endogenous FVs. Several topics focused on virus replication
and interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Use of FV in biomedical
research was highlighted with presentations on using FV vectors for gene therapy 
and FV proteins as scaffold for vaccine antigen presentation. On behalf of the FV
community, this report also includes a short tribute to commemorate Prof. Axel
Rethwilm, one of the leading experts in the field of retrovirology and foamy
viruses, who passed away 29 July 2014.

Pathogens such as HIV-1, with their minimalist genomes, must navigate cellular
networks and rely on hijacking and manipulating the host machinery for successful
replication. Limited overlap of host factors identified as vital for pathogen
replication may be explained by considering that pathogens target, rather than
specific cellular factors, crucial cellular pathways by targeting different,
functionally equivalent, protein-protein interactions within that pathway. The
ability to utilize alternative routes through cellular pathways may be essential 
for pathogen survival when restricted and provide flexibility depending on the
viral replication stage and the environment in the infected host. In this
minireview, we evaluate evidence supporting this notion, discuss specific HIV-1
examples, and consider the molecular mechanisms which allow pathogens to flexibly
exploit different routes.

Most viral pathogens that have emerged in humans have originated from various
animal species. Emergence is a multistep process involving an initial spill-over 
of the infectious agent into single individuals and its subsequent dissemination 
into the human population. Similar to simian immunodeficiency viruses and simian 
T lymphotropic viruses, simian foamy viruses (SFV) are retroviruses that are
widespread among non-human primates and can be transmitted to humans, giving rise
to a persistent infection, which seems to be controlled in the case of SFV. In
this review, we present current data on the discovery, cross-species
transmission, and molecular evolution of SFV in human populations initially
infected and thus at risk for zoonotic emergence.

Many important aspects of human retroviral infections cannot be fully evaluated
using only in vitro systems or unmodified animal models. An alternative approach 
involves the use of humanized mice, which consist of immunodeficient mice that
have been transplanted with human cells and/or tissues. Certain humanized mouse
models can support robust infection with human retroviruses including different
strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T cell leukemia virus
(HTLV). These models have provided wide-ranging insights into retroviral biology,
including detailed information on primary infection, in vivo replication and
pathogenesis, latent/persistent reservoir formation, and novel therapeutic
interventions. Here we describe the humanized mouse models that are most commonly
utilized to study retroviral infections, and outline some of the important
discoveries that these models have produced during several decades of intensive
research.

Although extensive research has demonstrated host-retrovirus microevolutionary
dynamics, it has been difficult to gain a deeper understanding of the
macroevolutionary patterns of host-retrovirus interactions. Here we use recent
technological advances to infer broad patterns in retroviral diversity,
evolution, and host-virus relationships by using a large-scale phylogenomic
approach using endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Retroviruses insert a proviral DNA
copy into the host cell genome to produce new viruses. ERVs are provirus
insertions in germline cells that are inherited down the host lineage and
consequently present a record of past host-viral associations. By mining ERVs
from 65 host genomes sampled across vertebrate diversity, we uncover a great
diversity of ERVs, indicating that retroviral sequences are much more prevalent
and widespread across vertebrates than previously appreciated. The majority of
ERV clades that we recover do not contain known retroviruses, implying either
that retroviral lineages are highly transient over evolutionary time or that a
considerable number of retroviruses remain to be identified. By characterizing
the distribution of ERVs, we show that no major vertebrate lineage has escaped
retroviral activity and that retroviruses are extreme host generalists, having an
unprecedented ability for rampant host switching among distantly related
vertebrates. In addition, we examine whether the distribution of ERVs can be
explained by host factors predicted to influence viral transmission and find that
internal fertilization has a pronounced effect on retroviral colonization of host
genomes. By capturing the mode and pattern of retroviral evolution and
contrasting ERV diversity with known retroviral diversity, our study provides a
cohesive framework to understand host-virus coevolution better.

BACKGROUND: One of the major functions of Nef is in the enhancement of the
infectivity of the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV,
respectively). However, the detailed mechanism of the enhancement of viral
infectivity by Nef remains unclear. Additionally, studies of mechanisms by which 
Nef enhances the infectivity of SIV are not as intensive as those of HIV-1.
METHODS: We generated short-lived Nef constructed by fusing Nef to a
proteasome-mediated protein degradation sequence to characterize the Nef role in 
viral infectivity.
RESULTS: The apparent expression level of the short-lived Nef was found to be
extremely lower than that of the wild-type Nef. Moreover, the expression level of
the short-lived Nef increased with the treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. The
infectivity of HIV-1 with the short-lived Nef was significantly lower than that
with the wild-type Nef. On the other hand, the short-lived Nef enhanced the
infectivity of SIVmac239, an ability observed to be interestingly equivalent to
that of the wild-type Nef. The short-lived Nef was not detected in SIVmac239, but
the wild-type Nef was, suggesting that the incorporation of Nef into SIVmac239 is
not important for the enhancement of SIVmac239 infectivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the findings suggest that the mechanisms of infectivity 
enhancement by Nef are different between HIV-1 and SIVmac239. Lastly, we propose 
the following hypothesis: even when the expression level of a protein is
extremely low, the protein may still be sufficiently functional.

The development of a panel of mucosally transmissible simian-human
immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge stocks from multiple virus clades would
facilitate preclinical evaluation of candidate HIV-1 vaccines and therapeutics.
The majority of SHIV stocks that have been generated to date have been derived
from clade B HIV-1 env sequences from viruses isolated during chronic infection
and typically required serial animal-to-animal adaptation for establishing
mucosal transmissibility and pathogenicity. To capture essential features of
mucosal transmission of clade C viruses, we produced a series of SHIVs with early
clade C HIV-1 env sequences from acutely HIV-1-infected individuals from South
Africa. SHIV-327c and SHIV-327cRM expressed env sequences that were 99.7 to 100% 
identical to the original HIV-1 isolate and did not require in vivo passaging for
mucosal infectivity. These challenge stocks infected rhesus monkeys efficiently
by both intrarectal and intravaginal routes, replicated to high levels during
acute infection, and established chronic setpoint viremia in 13 of 17 (76%)
infected animals. The SHIV-327cRM challenge stock was also titrated for both
single, high-dose intrarectal challenges and repetitive, low-dose intrarectal
challenges in rhesus monkeys. These SHIV challenge stocks should facilitate the
preclinical evaluation of vaccines and other interventions aimed at preventing
clade C HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCE: We describe the development of two related
clade C SHIV challenge stocks. These challenge stocks should prove useful for
preclinical testing of vaccines and other interventions aimed at preventing clade
C HIV-1 infection.

Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit the entry of a large
number of viruses. Not surprisingly, many viruses are refractory to this
inhibition. In this study, we report that different strains of HIV and SIV are
inhibited by human IFITM proteins to various degrees, with SIV of African green
monkeys (SIV(AGM)) being mostly restricted by human IFITM2. Interestingly,
SIV(AGM) is as much inhibited by human IFITM2 as by IFITM3 of its own host
African green monkeys. Our data further demonstrate that the entry of SIV(AGM) is
impaired by human IFITM2 and that this inhibition is overcome by the
cholesterol-binding compound amphotericin B that also overcomes IFITM inhibition 
of influenza A viruses. These results suggest that IFITM proteins exploit similar
mechanisms to inhibit the entry of both pH-independent primate lentiviruses and
the pH-dependent influenza A viruses.

The small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) include the caprine arthritis encephalitis
virus (CAEV) and the Maedi-Visna virus (MVV). Both of these viruses limit
production and can be a major source of economic loss to producers. Little is
known about how the immune system recognizes and responds to SRLVs, but due to
similarities with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV research can shed
light on the possible immune mechanisms that control or lead to disease
progression. This review will focus on the host immune response to HIV-1 and
SRLV, and will discuss the possibility of breeding for enhanced SRLV disease
resistance.

Retroviral replication proceeds through an obligate integrated DNA provirus,
making retroviral vectors attractive vehicles for human gene-therapy. Though most
of the host cell genome is available for integration, the process of integration 
site selection is not random. Retroviruses differ in their choice of
chromatin-associated features and also prefer particular nucleotide sequences at 
the point of insertion. Lentiviruses including HIV-1 preferentially integrate
within the bodies of active genes, whereas the prototypical gammaretrovirus
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) favors strong enhancers and active gene
promoter regions. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, and
recent research has demonstrated that HIV-1 and MoMLV targeting preferences are
in large part guided by integrase-interacting host factors (LEDGF/p75 for HIV-1
and BET proteins for MoMLV) that tether viral intasomes to chromatin. In each
case, the selectivity of epigenetic marks on histones recognized by the protein
tether helps to determine the integration distribution. In contrast, nucleotide
preferences at integration sites seem to be governed by the ability for the
integrase protein to locally bend the DNA duplex for pairwise insertion of the
viral DNA ends. We discuss approaches to alter integration site selection that
could potentially improve the safety of retroviral vectors in the clinic.

The development and verification of HIV-2 assays depends in part on the
availability of well-characterized samples, including those from reagent
repositories. During the development of an HIV-2 RNA quantification assay, two
HIV-2 viral isolates (CDC 301340 and CDC 301342) obtained from the NIAID AIDS
Reagent and Reference Repository were not detected leading to an investigation.
Two HIV-2 primers/probe sets of known performance in real-time viral RNA
quantification assays, targeting different regions of the virus, also failed to
generate RT-PCR products for these two isolates. These isolates were tested in
the HIV-1 specific COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test v2.0 (Roche Molecular 
Diagnostics) and were quantified at high copy number. Other HIV-2 isolates tested
were not amplified in the COBAS HIV-1 TaqMan assay. Furthermore, the discrepant
isolates were highly reactive in an HIV-1 p24 antigen test while the other HIV-2 
isolates showed very weak, if any, cross-reactivity with the HIV-1 p24 assay.
Phylogenetic tree analysis of sequences from the protease-reverse transcriptase
regions of the discrepant HIV-2 isolates mapped with HIV-1 Group M, Subtype
CRF02_AG confirming these isolates were of HIV-1 origin and had been
misclassified as HIV-2. The use of misclassified isolates in the verification of 
molecular and immunological assays can lead to misinterpretation of test results,
misdirection of efforts into assay redesign and increased development costs. The 
results of this study were shared with the NIAID AIDS Reagent Program, leading to
the reclassification of the two discrepant isolates as HIV-1.

We analyzed genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among 124 HIV-1 and 
19 HIV-2 strains in sera collected in 1986 from patients of the state hospital in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 env gp41 region of 
65 sequences characterized 37 (56.9%) as CRF06_cpx strains, 25 (38.5%) as
CRF02_AG, 2 (3.1%) as CRF09_cpx, and 1 (1.5%) as subtype A. Similarly,
phylogenetic analysis of the protease (PR) gene region of 73 sequences identified
52 (71.2%) as CRF06_cpx, 15 (20.5%) as CRF02_AG, 5 (6.8%) as subtype A, and 1
(1.4%) was a unique strain that clustered along the B/D lineage but basal to the 
node connecting the two lineages. HIV-2 PR or integrase (INT) groups A (n = 17
[89.5%]) and B (n = 2 [10.5%]) were found in both monotypic (n = 11) and
heterotypic HIV-1/HIV-2 (n = 8) infections, with few HIV-2 group B infections.
Based on limited available sampling, evidence suggests two recombinant viruses,
CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG, appear to have driven the beginning of the mid-1980s
HIV-1 epidemic in Burkina Faso.

Simian immunodeficiency viruses, simian T‑cell lymphotropic viruses, and simian
foamy viruses from nonhuman primates have crossed the species barrier to humans
at several time points, leading to the HIV and human T lymphotropic virus
epidemic and to sporadic cases of human infections with simian foamy viruses,
respectively. Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between simian
foamy virus, simian lymphotropic virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, but
seems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, as
illustrated by the different spread of HIV‑1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV‑2
groups. Among the four HIV‑1 groups, only HIV‑1 group M has spread worldwide, and
the actual diversity within HIV‑1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is the
result of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV‑2 only
spread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV‑1, the nine HIV‑2 
groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T lymphotropic
virus, type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simian
counterparts (simian T lymphotropic virus‑1, ‑2, ‑3) have been identified in
multiple nonhuman primate species. The majority of human infections are with
human T lymphotropic virus‑1, which is present throughout the world as clusters
of high endemicity. Humans are susceptible to a wide variety of simian foamy
viruses and seem to acquire these viruses more readily than simian
immunodeficiency viruses or simian T lymphotropic viruses, but neither signs of
disease in humans nor human‑to‑human transmission of simian foamy virus have been
documented yet. The current HIV‑1 M epidemic illustrates the impact of a single
cross‑species transmission. The recent discovery of HIV‑1 P, HIV‑2 I, new human T
lymphotropic virus‑1 and ‑3 variants, as well as simian foamy virus infections in
humans in Central Africa, show that our knowledge of genetic diversity and
cross‑species transmissions of simian retroviruses is still incomplete.

BACKGROUND: The discovery of novel anti-viral restriction factors illuminates
unknown aspects of innate sensing and immunity. We identified RNA-associated
Early-stage Anti-viral Factor (REAF) using a whole genome siRNA screen for
restriction factors to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that act in the early
phase of viral replication.
RESULTS: We observed more than 50 fold rescue of HIV-1 infection, using a focus
forming unit (FFU) assay, following knockdown of REAF by specific siRNA.
Quantitative PCR was used to show that REAF knockdown results in an increase of
early and late reverse transcripts which impacts the level of integration. REAF
thus appears to act at an early stage of the viral life cycle during reverse
transcription. Conversely when REAF is over-expressed in target cells less
infected cells are detectable and fewer reverse transcripts are produced. Human
REAF can also inhibit HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection.
REAF associates with viral nucleic acids and may act to prevent reverse
transcription.
CONCLUSIONS: This report firmly places REAF alongside APOBECs and SAMHD1 as a
potent inhibitor of HIV replication acting early in the replication cycle, just
after cell entry. We propose that REAF is part of an anti-viral surveillance
system destroying incoming retroviruses. This novel mechanism could apply to
invasion of cells by any intracellular pathogen.

The antiviral lectins griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin-N (CV-N), and scytovirin
(SVN), which inhibit several enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses, were
examined for their ability to inhibit entry mediated by Env proteins of delta-
and gammaretroviruses. The glycoproteins from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 
(HTLV-1) were resistant to the antiviral effects of all three lectins. For
gammaretroviruses, CV-N inhibited entry mediated by some but not all of the
envelopes examined, whereas GRFT and SVN displayed only little or no effect.

Crystal structures of beta- and gammaretrovirus fusion proteins reveal a role for
electrostatic stapling in viral entry.

Membrane fusion is a key step in the life cycle of all envelope viruses, but this
process is energetically unfavorable; the transmembrane fusion subunit (TM) of
the virion-attached glycoprotein actively catalyzes the membrane merger process. 
Retroviral glycoproteins are the prototypical system to study pH-independent
viral entry. In this study, we determined crystal structures of extramembrane
regions of the TMs from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and xenotropic murine
leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) at 1.7-Å and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively. 
The structures are comprised of a trimer of hairpins that is characteristic of
class I viral fusion proteins and now completes a structural library of
retroviral fusion proteins. Our results allowed us to identify a series of intra-
and interchain electrostatic interactions in the heptad repeat and chain reversal
regions. Mutagenesis reveals that charge-neutralizing salt bridge mutations
significantly destabilize the postfusion six-helix bundle and abrogate retroviral
infection, demonstrating that electrostatic stapling of the fusion subunit is
essential for viral entry. Our data indicate that salt bridges are a major
stabilizing force on the MPMV and XMRV retroviral TMs and likely provide the key 
energetics for viral and host membrane fusion.

Evolution of foamy viruses: the most ancient of all retroviruses.

Str.7, Würzburg 97078, Germany. virologie@vim.uni-wuerzburg.de.

Recent evidence indicates that foamy viruses (FVs) are the oldest retroviruses
(RVs) that we know and coevolved with their hosts for several hundred million
years. This coevolution may have contributed to the non-pathogenicity of FVs, an 
important factor in development of foamy viral vectors in gene therapy. However, 
various questions on the molecular evolution of FVs remain still unanswered. The 
analysis of the spectrum of animal species infected by exogenous FVs or harboring
endogenous FV elements in their genome is pivotal. Furthermore, animal studies
might reveal important issues, such as the identification of the FV in vivo
target cells, which than require a detailed characterization, to resolve the
molecular basis of the accuracy with which FVs copy their genome. The issues of
the extent of FV viremia and of the nature of the virion genome (RNA vs. DNA)
also need to be experimentally addressed.

Defective HIV-1 quasispecies in the form of multiply drug-resistant proviral DNA 
within cells can be rescued by superinfection with different subtype variants of 
HIV-1 and by HIV-2 and SIV.

Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montréal, Québec,
Canada.

OBJECTIVES: HIV-1 generates swarms of similar, but genetically distinct, variants
termed quasispecies and many of these variants can be defective. A relevant
question is whether such defective species can contribute to viral pathogenesis. 
Indeed, we previously reported that a presumed recombination of defective
proviral DNA with other complementary defective proviral DNA or with wild-type
viral DNA in the aftermath of superinfection could lead to the rescue of
defective provirus and the production of replication-competent virus. We then
wished to determine whether such rescue could be affected by viruses of different
subtypes or even by other members of the retrovirus family.
METHODS: Here, we have used drug resistance mutations within the HIV genome as
markers of potential recombination.
RESULTS: We show that a defective proviral DNA within cells can be rescued by the
superinfection of MT2 cells by various subtypes of HIV-1, and by HIV-2 and simian
immunodeficiency virus, but not by human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 or by
human herpes virus-6. The drug-resistance phenotype of the rescued HIV was
confirmed in a second round of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Defective proviral HIV-1 can be rescued by the infection by
different variants of HIV-1 and by several other retroviruses as well.

Cellular entry of retroviruses.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Virology, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

The retrovirus family contains several important human and animal pathogens,
including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Studies with retroviruses were instrumental to 
our present understanding of the cellular entry of enveloped viruses in general. 
For instance, studies with alpharetroviruses defined receptor engagement, as
opposed to low pH, as a trigger for the envelope protein-driven membrane fusion. 
The insights into the retroviral entry process allowed the generation of a new
class of antivirals, entry inhibitors, and these therapeutics are at present used
for treatment of HIV/AIDS. In this chapter, we will summarize key concepts
established for entry of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV), a widely used
model system for retroviral entry. We will then review how foamy virus and HIV,
primate- and human retroviruses, enter target cells, and how the interaction of
the viral and cellular factors involved in the cellular entry of these viruses
impacts viral tropism, pathogenesis and approaches to therapy and vaccine
development.

Heterogeneous susceptibility of circulating SIV isolate capsids to
HIV-interacting factors.

Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.

BACKGROUND: Many species of non-human primates in Africa are naturally infected
by simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) and humans stand at the forefront of
exposure to these viruses in Sub-Saharan Africa. Cross-species transmission and
adaptation of SIV to humans have given rise to human immunodeficiency viruses
(HIV-1 and HIV-2) on twelve accountable, independent occasions. However, the
determinants contributing to a simian-to-human lasting transmission are not fully
understood. Following entry, viral cores are released into the cytoplasm and
become the principal target of host cellular factors. Here, we evaluated cellular
factors likely to be involved in potential new SIV cross-species transmissions.
We investigated the interactions of capsids from naturally circulating SIV
isolates with both HIV-1 restricting (i.e. TRIM5 proteins) and facilitating (i.e.
cyclophilin A and nucleopore-associated Nup358/RanBP2 and Nup153) factors in
single-round infectivity assays that reproduce early stages of the viral
life-cycle.
RESULTS: We show that human TRIM5α is unlikely to prevent cross-species
transmission of any SIV we tested and observed that the SIV CA-CypA interaction
is a widespread but not a universal feature. Moreover, entry in the nucleus of
different SIV appeared to follow pathways that do not necessarily recruit
Nup358/RanBP2 or Nup153, and this regardless of their interaction with CypA.
Nevertheless, we found that, like HIV-1, human-adapted HIV-2 infection was
dependent on Nup358/RanBP2 and Nup153 interactions for optimal infection.
Furthermore, we found that, unlike HIV CA, SIV CA did not require a direct
interaction with the Cyp-like domain of Nup358/RanBP2 to carry out successful
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating SIV present a variety of phenotypes with regard to
CA-interacting restricting or facilitating factors. Altogether, we unveiled
unidentified pathways for SIV CA, which could also be exploited by HIV in
different cellular contexts, to drive entry into the nucleus. Our findings
warrant a closer evaluation of other potential defenses against circulating SIV.

Restriction of diverse retroviruses by SAMHD1.

Kim B, Lindemann D, Landau NR.

BACKGROUND: SAMHD1 is a triphosphohydrolase that restricts the replication of
HIV-1 and SIV in myeloid cells. In macrophages and dendritic cells, SAMHD1
restricts virus replication by diminishing the deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool 
to a level below that which supports lentiviral reverse transcription. HIV-2 and 
related SIVs encode the accessory protein Vpx to induce the proteasomal
degradation of SAMHD1 following virus entry. While SAMHD1 has been shown to
restrict HIV-1 and SIV, the breadth of its restriction is not known and whether
other viruses have a means to counteract the restriction has not been determined.
RESULTS: We show that SAMHD1 restricts a wide array of divergent retroviruses,
including the alpha, beta and gamma classes. Murine leukemia virus was restricted
by SAMHD1 in macrophages yet removal of SAMHD1 did not alleviate the block to
infection because of an additional block to viral nuclear import. Prototype foamy
virus (PFV) and Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) were the only
retroviruses tested that were not restricted by SAMHD1. PFV reverse transcribes
predominantly prior to entry and thus is unaffected by the dNTP level in the
target cell. It is possible that HTLV-1 has a mechanism to render the virus
resistant to SAMHD1-mediated restriction.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SAMHD1 has broad anti-retroviral activity
against which most viruses have not found an escape.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 promotes transcriptional repression of integrated
retroviruses.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is a cellular enzyme with a fundamental
role in DNA repair and the regulation of chromatin structure, processes involved 
in the cellular response to retroviral DNA integration. However, the function of 
PARP-1 in retroviral DNA integration is controversial, probably due to the
functional redundancy of the PARP family in mammalian cells. We evaluated the
function of PARP-1 in retroviral infection using the chicken B lymphoblastoid
cell line DT40. These cells lack significant PARP-1 functional redundancy and
efficiently support the postentry early events of the mammalian-retrovirus
replication cycle. We observed that DT40 PARP-1(-/-) cells were 9- and 6-fold
more susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- and
murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived viral vectors, respectively, than cells
expressing PARP-1. Production of avian Rous-associated virus type 1 was also
impaired by PARP-1. However, the susceptibilities of these cell lines to
infection by the nonretrovirus vesicular stomatitis virus were indistinguishable.
Real-time PCR analysis of the HIV-1 life cycle demonstrated that PARP-1 did not
impair reverse transcription, nuclear import of the preintegration complex, or
viral DNA integration, suggesting that PARP-1 regulates a postintegration step.
In support of this hypothesis, pharmacological inhibition of the epigenetic
mechanism of transcriptional silencing increased retroviral expression in
PARP-1-expressing cells, suppressing the differences observed. Further analysis
of the implicated molecular mechanism indicated that PARP-1-mediated retroviral
silencing requires the C-terminal region, but not the enzymatic activity, of the 
protein. In sum, our data indicate a novel role of PARP-1 in the transcriptional 
repression of integrated retroviruses.

Betaretroviral envelope subunits are noncovalently associated and restricted to
the mammalian class.

Henzy JE(1), Coffin JM.

Author information: 
(1)Tufts University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Biology and
Microbiology, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

The structure of the transmembrane subunit (TM) of the retroviral envelope
glycoprotein (Env) is highly conserved among most retrovirus genera and includes 
a pair of cysteines that forms an intramolecular disulfide loop within the
ectodomain. Alpha-, gamma-, and deltaretroviruses have a third cysteine, adjacent
to the loop, which forms a disulfide bond between TM and the surface subunit (SU)
of Env, while lentiviruses, which have noncovalently associated subunits, lack
this third cysteine. The Betaretrovirus genus includes Jaagsiekte sheep
retrovirus (JSRV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), as well as many
endogenous retroviruses. Envelope subunit association had not been characterized 
in the betaretroviruses, but lack of a third cysteine in the TM ectodomain
suggested noncovalently associated subunits. We tested the Env proteins of JSRV
and MMTV, as well as human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K)108--a
betaretrovirus-like human endogenous retrovirus--for intersubunit bonding and
found that, as in the lentiviruses, the Env subunits lack an intersubunit
disulfide bond. Since these results suggest that the number of cysteines in the
TM loop region readily distinguishes between covalent and noncovalent structure, 
we surveyed endogenous retroviral TM sequences in the genomes of vertebrates
represented in public databases and found that (i) retroviruses with
noncovalently associated subunits have been present during all of anthropoid
evolution and (ii) the noncovalent env motif is limited to mammals, while the
covalent type is found among five vertebrate classes. We discuss implications of 
these findings for retroviral evolution, cross-species transmissions, and
recombination events involving the env gene.

Contribution of SAM and HD domains to retroviral restriction mediated by human
SAMHD1.

The human SAMHD1 protein is a novel retroviral restriction factor expressed in
myeloid cells. Previous work has correlated the deoxynucleotide
triphosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 with its ability to block HIV-1 and
SIV(mac) infection. SAMHD1 is comprised of the sterile alpha motif (SAM) and
histidine-aspartic (HD) domains; however the contribution of these domains to
retroviral restriction is not understood. Mutagenesis and deletion studies
revealed that expression of the sole HD domain of SAMHD1 is sufficient to achieve
potent restriction of HIV-1 and SIV(mac). We demonstrated that the HD domain of
SAMHD1 is essential for the ability of SAMHD1 to oligomerize by using a
biochemical assay. In agreement with previous observations, we mapped the
RNA-binding ability of SAMHD1 to the HD domain. We also demonstrated a direct
interaction of SAMHD1 with RNA by using enzymatically-active purified SAMHD1
protein from insect cells. Interestingly, we showed that double-stranded RNA
inhibits the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 in vitro suggesting the possibility
that RNA from a pathogen might modulate the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 in
cells. By contrast, we found that the SAM domain is dispensable for retroviral
restriction, oligomerization and RNA binding. Finally we tested the ability of
SAMHD1 to block the infection of retroviruses other than HIV-1 and SIV(mac).
These results showed that SAMHD1 blocks infection of HIV-2, feline
immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), Equine
infectious anemia virus (EIAV), N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), and
B-tropic murine leukemia virus (B-MLV).

The RNA genome of retroviruses is encased within a protein capsid. To gather
insight into the assembly and function of this capsid, we used electron
cryotomography to image human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and equine infectious 
anemia virus (EIAV) particles. While the majority of viral cores appeared closed,
a variety of unclosed structures including rolled sheets, extra flaps, and cores 
with holes in the tip were also seen. Simulations of nonequilibrium growth of
elastic sheets recapitulated each of these aberrations and further predicted the 
occasional presence of seams, for which tentative evidence was also found within 
the cryotomograms. To test the integrity of viral capsids in vivo, we observed
that ~25% of cytoplasmic HIV complexes captured by TRIM5α had holes large enough 
to allow internal green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules to escape. Together, 
these findings suggest that HIV assembly at least sometimes involves the union in
space of two edges of a curling sheet and results in a substantial number of
unclosed forms.

Cancer and viruses: a double-edged sword.

Butt AQ(1), Miggin SM.

(1)Immune Signalling Group, Institute of Immunology, Department of Biology,
National University of Ireland Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland.

Oncovirus, synonymously called a 'tumour virus', is a virus that can cause
cancer. An oncolytic virus preferentially infects the host's cancer cells and
lyses them, causing tumour destruction, and is thus referred to as a 'cancer
killing virus'. With an estimated 11% of cancer-associated deaths caused by
oncoviruses and the possibility that many cancers may be treated by using
oncolytic viruses, the role of viruses in cancer may be viewed as a double-edged 
sword. A total of seven human cancer viruses have been identified as oncoviruses,
having been associated with various cancers. Conversely, a large number of
oncolytic viruses have shown great potential towards the treatment of certain
types of cancer. Proteomics has now been applied towards understanding the
complex interplay that exists between oncoviruses and the immune responses that
serve to prevent oncoviral diseases. This review attempts to summarise the
neoplastic potential of human tumour associated viruses and associated vaccine
successes. The potential use of oncolytic viruses for the therapeutic
intervention of cancer will also be discussed. Finally, this review will discuss 
the enormous potential of proteomics technology in the field of oncovirology.

Cross-species transmission of simian retroviruses: how and why they could lead to
the emergence of new diseases in the human population.

Locatelli S, Peeters M.

The HIV-1 group M epidemic illustrates the extraordinary impact and consequences 
resulting from a single zoonotic transmission. Exposure to blood or other
secretions of infected animals, through hunting and butchering of bushmeat, or
through bites and scratches inflicted by pet nonhuman primates (NHPs), represent 
the most plausible source for human infection with simian immunodeficiency virus 
(SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) and simian foamy virus. The chance
for cross-species transmissions could increase when frequency of exposure and
retrovirus prevalence is high. According to the most recent data, human exposure 
to SIV or STLV appears heterogeneous across the African countries surveyed.
Exposure is not sufficient to trigger disease: viral and host molecular
characteristics and compatibility are fundamental factors to establish infection.
A successful species jump is achieved when the pathogen becomes transmissible
between individuals within the new host population. To spread efficiently, HIV
likely required changes in human behavior. Given the increasing exposure to NHP
pathogens through hunting and butchering, it is likely that SIV and other simian 
viruses are still transmitted to the human population. The behavioral and
socio-economic context of the twenty-first century provides favorable conditions 
for the emergence and spread of new epidemics. Therefore, it is important to
evaluate which retroviruses the human population is exposed to and to better
understand how these viruses enter, infect, adapt and spread to its new host.

Retrovirus and lentivirus vector design and methods of cell conditioning.

Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

Retroviruses are useful tools for the efficient delivery of genes to mammalian
cells, owing to their ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome. Over
the past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy clinical 
trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. The
earliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses such
as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with envelope
proteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope
protein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can efficiently
introduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, gammaretroviral vectors
have the disadvantage that they are unable to efficiently transduce nondividing
or slowly dividing cells. As a result, specific protocols have been developed to 
activate cells through the use of growth factors and cytokines. In the case of
hematopoietic stem cells, activation has to be carefully controlled so that
pluripotency is maintained. For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors are
being superseded by lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus
type-1 (HIV-1) which has additional accessory proteins that enable integration in
the absence of cell division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vector
design has evolved to address a number of safety concerns. These include separate
expression of the viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading to
the generation of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development of
self-inactivating (SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation of
neighboring genes and allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that may
target gene expression more physiologically to particular cell types.

One of the most fascinating areas in retrovirology is the study of foamy viruses 
(FVs), because these viruses appear to do everything that is common to all other 
retroviruses differently. FVs have found a completely new way to propagate their 
genome. And they do this extremely successfully because most of wild non-human
primates, felines, bovines, equines, and small ruminants are likely to be
non-pathogenically infected. The success of FVs can also be viewed from a
different angle, since they replicate very conservatively and do not need to
shape their genotypic and phenotypic makeup every now and then. The elucidation
of the underlying basic mechanisms of the FV replication strategy is the topic of
this review.

Studies on HIV virology and pathogenesis address the complex mechanisms that
result in the HIV infection of the cell and destruction of the immune system.
These studies are focused on both the structure and the replication
characteristics of HIV and on the interaction of the virus with the host.
Continuous updating of knowledge on structure, variability and replication of
HIV, as well as the characteristics of the host immune response, are essential to
refine virological and immunological mechanisms associated with the viral
infection and allow us to identify key molecules in the virus life cycle that can
be important for the design of new diagnostic assays and specific antiviral drugs
and vaccines. In this article we review the characteristics of molecular
structure, replication and pathogenesis of HIV, with a particular focus on those 
aspects that are important for the design of diagnostic assays.

The host range of retroviral vectors including lentiviral vectors can be expanded
or altered by a process known as pseudotyping. Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors
consist of vector particles bearing glycoproteins (GPs) derived from other
enveloped viruses. Such particles possess the tropism of the virus from which the
GP was derived. For example, to exploit the natural neural tropism of rabies
virus, vectors designed to target the central nervous system have been
pseudotyped using rabies virus-derived GPs. Among the first and still most widely
used GPs for pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is the vesicular stomatitis virus GP
(VSV-G), due to the very broad tropism and stability of the resulting
pseudotypes. Pseudotypes involving VSV-G have become effectively the standard for
evaluating the efficiency of other pseudotypes. This review samples a few of the 
more prominent examples from the ever-expanding list of published lentiviral
pseudotypes, noting comparisons made with pseudotypes involving VSV-G in terms of
titer, viral particle stability, toxicity, and host-cell specificity. Particular 
attention is paid to publications of successfully targeting a specific organ or
cell types.

Primate lentiviruses encode a small protein designated Nef that has been shown to
be a major determinant of virus pathogenicity. Nef regulates multiple host
factors in order to optimize the cellular environment for virus replication. The 
mechanisms by which this small protein modulates distinct host cell properties
provide intriguing insight into the intricate interaction between virus and host.

In vivo transduction of nondividing cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
(HIV-1)-based vectors results in transgene expression that is stable over several
months. However, the use of HIV-1 vectors raises concerns about their safety.
Here we describe a self-inactivating HIV-1 vector with a 400-nucleotide deletion 
in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). The deletion, which includes the TATA box, 
abolished the LTR promoter activity but did not affect vector titers or transgene
expression in vitro. The self-inactivating vector transduced neurons in vivo as
efficiently as a vector with full-length LTRs. The inactivation design achieved
in this work improves significantly the biosafety of HIV-derived vectors, as it
reduces the likelihood that replication-competent retroviruses will originate in 
the vector producer and target cells, and hampers recombination with wild-type
HIV in an infected host. Moreover, it improves the potential performance of the
vector by removing LTR sequences previously associated with transcriptional
interference and suppression in vivo and by allowing the construction of
more-stringent tissue-specific or regulatable vectors.

Replication-competent chimeric lenti-oncovirus with expanded host cell tropism.

Baboon bone marrow was grafted into human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected 
patients in the course of recent trials for AIDS treatment. Since the baboon
genome harbors multiple copies of an endogenous oncovirus, chimeric
lenti-oncoviruses could emerge in the xenotransplant recipient. To analyze the
potential replication competence of hybrid viruses between different genera of
retroviruses, we replaced most of the env gene of simian immunodeficiency virus
with the env gene of an amphotropic murine leukemia virus. The hybrid virus could
be propagated in human T-cell lines, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
rhesus macaques, and in CD4- B-cell lines. Because of the expanded cell tropism, 
the hybrid virus might have a selective advantage in comparison to parental
viruses. Therefore, emerging chimeric viruses may be considered a serious risk of
xenotransplantation. A note of caution is also suggested for the use of
pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy.

Animal immunodeficiency viruses.

Utrecht, Netherlands.

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has morphological, physical and biochemical
characteristics similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS 
in man. However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an
antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated.
FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially 
available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly
engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV
infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia 
and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage
is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation 
period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment 
of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first
time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of
appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later,
the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis,
enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin.
Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a
smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a
period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has 
been shown to accelerate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing 
between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated
which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine
immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to
obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes
of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central 
nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline
representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to
encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces
syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses
have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of
BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced.
Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and
env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small
ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the
env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV
displays extensive genomic variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Isolation of a new human retrovirus from West African patients with AIDS.

Clavel F, Guétard D, Brun-Vézinet F, Chamaret S, Rey MA, Santos-Ferreira MO,
Laurent AG, Dauguet C, Katlama C, Rouzioux C, et al.

The etiological agent of AIDS, LAV/HTLV-III, is common in Central Africa but is
not endemic in other areas of that continent. A novel human retrovirus, distinct 
from LAV/HTLV-III, has now been isolated from two AIDS patients from West Africa.
Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological and
morphological properties very similar to LAV but that it differs in some of its
antigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, 
the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelope
glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized
by serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termed
STLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closely
related to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAV
subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to 
as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac.

Type-C oncovirus isolate from human leukemic bone marrow: further in vitro and in
vivo characterization.

Nooter K, Overdevest J, Dubbes R, Koch G, Bentvelzen P, Zurcher C, Coolen J,
Calafat J.

Rabbit corneal cells transformed by a putative human type-C helper virus
pseudotype of the mouse sarcoma virus produce large amounts of transforming and
non-transforming viruses. The virions are antigenically related to the woolly
monkey (simian) sarcoma-leukemia type-C oncovirus. Typical sarcoma virus lesions 
developed in newborn rats injected with virus-producing rabbit cells. Cells
producing only the putative type-C helper viruses as a result of exposure to a
high dilution of transforming virus stock induce lymphosarcomas after inoculation
into newborn rats.
