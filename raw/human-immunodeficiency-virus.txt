The emergence and spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance
from antiretroviral roll-out programs remain a threat to long-term control of the
HIV-AIDS epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The patterns of
drug resistance and factors driving emergence of resistance are complex and
multifactorial. The key drivers of drug resistance in LMICs are reviewed here,
and recommendations are made to limit their influence on antiretroviral therapy
efficacy.

The human immunodeficiency virus epidemic is a major health challenge of the
twenty-first century as the transition from infectious complications to
noncommunicable disease becomes more evident. These patients may present to the
emergency department with a variety of cardiovascular diseases, such as acute
coronary syndromes, heart failure, pericardial disease, infective endocarditis,
venothromboembolism, and other conditions. Increased awareness is needed among
health care professionals to enhance adequate identification and promote prompt
management of these patients.

Superinfection is frequently detected among individuals infected by human
immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). Superinfection occurs at similar
frequencies at acute and chronic infection stages but less frequently than
primary infection. This observation indicates that the immune responses elicited 
by natural HIV-1 infection may play a role in curb of superinfection; however,
these responses are not sufficiently strong to completely prevent superinfection.
Thus, a successful HIV-1 vaccine likely needs to induce more potent and broader
immune responses than those elicited by primary infection. On the other hand,
potent and broad neutralization responses are more often detected after
superinfection than during monoinfection. This suggests that broadly neutralizing
antibodies are more likely induced by sequential immunization of multiple
different immunogens than with only one form of envelope glycoprotein immunogens.
Understanding why the protection from superinfection by immunity induced by
primary infection is insufficient and if superinfection can lead to
cross-reactive immune responses will be highly informative for HIV-1 vaccine
design.

Human DNA cytosine-to-uracil deaminases catalyze mutations in both pathogen and
cellular genomes. APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H restrict human
immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in cells deficient in the viral
infectivity factor (Vif), and have the potential to catalyze sublethal levels of 
mutation in viral genomes in Vif-proficient cells. At least two APOBEC3 enzymes, 
and in particular APOBEC3B, are sources of somatic mutagenesis in cancer cells
that drive tumor evolution and may manifest clinically as recurrence, metastasis,
and/or therapy resistance. Consequently, APOBEC3 enzymes are tantalizing targets 
for developing chemical probes and therapeutic molecules to harness mutational
processes in human disease. This review highlights recent efforts to chemically
manipulate APOBEC3 activities.

Healthcare delivery has advanced due to the implementation of point-of-care
testing, which is often performed within minutes to hours in minimally equipped
laboratories or at home. Technologic advances are leading to point-of-care kits
that incorporate nucleic acid-based assays, including polymerase chain reaction, 
isothermal amplification, ligation, and hybridization reactions. As a limited
number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with clinically
significant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance, assays to detect 
these mutations have been developed. Early versions of these assays have been
used in research. This review summarizes the principles underlying each assay and
discusses strategic needs for their incorporation into the management of HIV
infection.

BACKGROUND: Mucins are large O-linked glycosylated proteins which give mucus
their gel-forming properties. There are indications that mucus and mucins in
saliva, breast milk and in the cervical plug inhibit the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV-1) in an in vitro assay. Crude mucus gels form continuous layers on
the epithelial surfaces of the major internal tracts of the body and protect
these epithelial surfaces against aggressive luminal factors such as hydrochloric
acid and pepsin proteolysis in the stomach lumen, the movement of hard faecal
pellets in the colon at high pressure, the effects of shear against the vaginal
epithelium during intercourse and the presence of foreign substances in the
respiratory airways. Tumour-associated epitopes on mucins make them suitable as
immune-targets on malignant epithelial cells, rendering mucins important as
diagnostic and prognostic markers for various diseases, even influencing the
design of mucin-based vaccines. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of 
HIV-AIDS in the world. The main points of viral transmission are via the vaginal 
epithelium during sexual intercourse and mother-to-child transmission during
breast-feeding. There have been many studies showing that several body fluids
have components that prevent the transmission of HIV-1 from infected to
non-infected persons through various forms of contact. Crude saliva and its
purified mucins, MUC5B and MUC7, and the purified mucins from breast milk, MUC1
and MUC4 and pregnancy plug cervical mucus (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6),
inhibit HIV-1 in an in vitro assay. There are conflicting reports of whether
crude breast-milk inhibits HIV-1 in an in vitro assay. However studies with a
humanised BLT mouse show that breast-milk does inhibit HIV and that
breast-feeding is still advisable even amongst HIV-positive women in
under-resourced areas, preferably in conjunction with anti-retroviral treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings raise questions of how such a naturally occurring
biological substance such as mucus, with remarkable protective properties of
epithelial surfaces against aggressive luminal factors in delicate locations,
could be used as a tool in the fight against HIV-AIDS, which has reached epidemic
proportions in sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases remain a major concern
for blood safety, particularly with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus
(HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nucleic acid testing (NAT) in
donor screening shortens the serologically negative window period and reduces
virus transmission. The cobas MPX (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, New
Jersey) is a recently developed multiplex qualitative PCR system that enables the
simultaneous detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV with improved sensitivity and
throughput using cobas 6800 and 8800 instruments.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct an evaluation of the clinical
sensitivity and specificity of cobas MPX detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV in
clinical specimens.
STUDY DESIGN: Among samples referred for HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 quantification at
Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, positive samples were 
selected to evaluate sensitivity. A total of 843 samples was tested using both
cobas MPX and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan Tests for HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 using
the cobas 8800 system and a COBAS TaqMan 96 analyzer, respectively. Samples that 
showed discrepancies were confirmed by nested PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: The cobas MPX achieved excellent sensitivity and specificity for the
detection of HBV, HCV, and HIV-1 in clinical samples. We found that the lower
limit of detection (LOD) of blood screening by NAT actually improves clinical
sensitivity, and occult HBV infection prevalence among healthy employees of the
hospital was rather high.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins Mimic Human T Cell Receptors Inducing
Cross-Reactive Antibodies.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) hides from the immune system in part by
mimicking host antigens, including human leukocyte antigens. It is demonstrated
here that HIV also mimics the V-β-D-J-β of approximately seventy percent of about
600 randomly selected human T cell receptors (TCR). This degree of mimicry is
greater than any other human pathogen, commensal or symbiotic organism studied.
These data suggest that HIV may be evolving into a commensal organism just as
simian immunodeficiency virus has done in some types of monkeys. The gp120
envelope protein, Nef protein and Pol protein are particularly similar to host
TCR, camouflaging HIV from the immune system and creating serious barriers to the
development of safe HIV vaccines. One consequence of HIV mimicry of host TCR is
that antibodies against HIV proteins have a significant probability of
recognizing the corresponding TCR as antigenic targets, explaining the widespread
observation of lymphocytotoxic autoantibodies in acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). Quantitative enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assays (ELISA)
demonstrated that every HIV antibody tested recognized at least one of twelve
TCR, and as many as seven, with a binding constant in the 10-8 to 10-9 m range.
HIV immunity also affects microbiome tolerance in ways that correlate with
susceptibility to specific opportunistic infections.

High-quality, simplified, and low-cost human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug
resistance tests that are able to provide timely actionable HIV resistance data
at individual, population, and programmatic levels are needed to confront the
emerging drug-resistant HIV epidemic. Next-generation sequencing technologies
embedded in automated cloud-computing analysis environments are ideally suited
for such endeavor. Whereas NGS can reduce costs over Sanger sequencing, automated
analysis pipelines make NGS accessible to molecular laboratories regardless of
the available bioinformatic skills. They can also produce highly structured,
high-quality data that could be examined by healthcare officials and program
managers on a real-time basis to allow timely public health action. Here we
discuss the opportunities and challenges of such an approach.

School of Medicine.

As treatment options coalesce around a smaller number of antiretroviral drugs
(ARVs), data are emerging on the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) selected by the
most widely used ARVs and on the impact of these DRMs on ARV susceptibility and
virological response to first- and later-line treatment regimens. Recent studies 
have described the DRMs that emerge in patients receiving tenofovir prodrugs, the
nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz and rilpivirine,
ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, and the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and
elvitegravir. Several small studies have described DRMs that emerge in patients
receiving dolutegravir.

Prognostic Factors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Patients on Chronic
Hemodialysis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nephrology, Hospital de Santa Cruz, Lisbon, Portugal.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
patients on hemodialysis (HD) have increased, and their prognostic factors are
still poorly clarified. The study aimed to identify factors that can influence
the survival of HIV-infected patients on HD.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 44 HIV-infected patients on
HD.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (39%) died. Median survival on HD was 30.8 months
and the survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 82.5 and 62.9%, respectively. Male
(relative risk [RR] 3.1, p = 0.040) and blacks (RR 2.5, p = 0.037) had higher
risk of death. The patients who died had a shorter duration of HIV infection (p =
0.028), had a higher viral load (p = 0.044), more opportunistic infections (p =
0.013), and a lower serum albumin (p = 0.009). Lower serum albumin, nonsexual HIV
transmission, viral load, opportunistic infections, and usage of catheters were
associated with lower survival.
CONCLUSION: Several demographic, viral, and dialysis variables may help to
predict survival of this population. The intervention in these factors could
improve their prognosis.

Viruses are completely dependent upon cellular machinery to support replication
and have therefore developed strategies to co-opt cellular processes to optimize 
infection and counter host immune defenses. Many viruses, including human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), encode a relatively small number of genes.
Viruses with limited genetic content often encode multifunctional proteins that
function at multiple stages of the viral replication cycle. In this review, we
discuss the functions of HIV-1 regulatory (Tat and Rev) and accessory (Vif, Vpr, 
Vpu, and Nef) proteins. Each of these proteins has a highly conserved primary
activity; however, numerous additional activities have been attributed to these
viral proteins. We explore the possibility that HIV-1 proteins leverage their
multifunctional nature to alter host transcriptional networks to elicit a diverse
set of cellular responses. Although these transcriptional effects appear to
benefit the virus, it is not yet clear whether they are strongly selected for
during viral evolution or are a ripple effect from the primary function. As our
detailed knowledge of these viral proteins improves, we will undoubtedly uncover 
how the multifunctional nature of these HIV-1 regulatory and accessory proteins, 
and in particular their transcriptional functions, work to drive viral
pathogenesis.

With increasing survival of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1), the manifestation of heterogeneous neurological complications is 
also increasing alarmingly in these patients. Currently, more than 30% of about
40 million HIV-1 infected people worldwide develop central nervous system
(CNS)-associated dysfunction, including dementia, sensory, and motor neuropathy. 
Furthermore, the highly effective antiretroviral therapy has been shown to
increase the prevalence of mild cognitive functions while reducing other
HIV-1-associated neurological complications. On the contrary, the presence of
neurological disorder frequently affects the outcome of conventional HIV-1
therapy. Although, both the children and adults suffer from the post-HIV
treatment-associated cognitive impairment, adults, especially depending on the
age of disease onset, are more prone to CNS dysfunction. Thus, addressing
neurological complications in an HIV-1-infected patient is a delicate balance of 
several factors and requires characterization of the molecular signature of
associated CNS disorders involving intricate cross-talk with HIV-1-derived
neurotoxins and other cellular factors. In this review, we summarize some of the 
current data supporting both the direct and indirect mechanisms, including
neuro-inflammation and genome instability in association with aging, leading to
CNS dysfunction after HIV-1 infection, and discuss the potential strategies
addressing the treatment or prevention of HIV-1-mediated neurotoxicity.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a significant source of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. No effective vaccine is available to prevent HIV
transmission, and although antiretroviral therapy can prevent disease
progression, it does not cure HIV infection. Substantial effort is therefore
currently directed toward basic research on HIV pathogenesis and persistence and 
developing methods to stop the spread of the HIV epidemic and cure those
individuals already infected with HIV. Humanized mice are versatile tools for the
study of HIV and its interaction with the human immune system. These models
generally consist of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human cells or
reconstituted with a near-complete human immune system. Here, we describe the
major humanized mouse models currently in use, and some recent advances that have
been made in HIV research/therapeutics using these models.

BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive subjects present impairment in 
muscle function, neural activation, balance, and gait. In other populations, all 
of these factors have been associated with muscle strength asymmetry.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the existence of muscle strength asymmetry between
dominant and non-dominant lower limbs and to determine the
hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio in Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive 
subjects.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 48 subjects were included (22 men and 26 
women; mean age 44.6 years), all of them under highly active antiretroviral
therapy. They performed isokinetic strength efforts at speeds of 60°/s and 180°/s
for knee extension and flexion in concentric-concentric mode.
RESULTS: Peak torque was higher (p<0.01) at 60°/s for quadriceps (193, SD=57 vs. 
173, SD=55% body mass) and hamstrings (97, SD=36 vs. 90, SD=37% body mass) in
dominant compared to non-dominant. Similarly, peak torque was higher at 180°/s
(quadriceps 128, SD=44 vs. 112, SD=42; hamstrings 64, SD=24 vs. 57, SD=26% body
mass) in dominant. Average power was also higher for all muscle groups and
speeds, comparing dominant with non-dominant. The hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio 
at 60°/s was 0.50 for dominant and 0.52 for non-dominant, and at 180°/s, it was
0.51 for both limbs, with no significant difference between them. The percentage 
of subjects with strength asymmetry ranged from 46 to 58%, depending upon muscle 
group and speed analyzed.
CONCLUSION: Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive subjects present muscle
strength asymmetry between lower limbs, assessed through isokinetic dynamometry.

Although potent combination antiretroviral therapy can effectively block viral
replication in the host, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists due to the
existence of latent but replication-competent proviruses residing primarily in a 
very small population of resting memory CD4+ T cells. Viral latency is
established when the expression of the autoregulatory viral trans-activating
factor Tat is reduced to subthreshold levels. The absence of Tat reduces HIV
transcription and protein production to levels that make the host cell invisible 
to the immune system and refractory to antiretroviral treatment. Key host cell
mechanisms that drive HIV into latency are sequestration of transcription
initiation factors, establishment of epigenetic barriers inactivating the
proviral promoter, and blockage of the assembly of the host elongation factor
P-TEFb. This comprehensive understanding of the molecular control of HIV
transcription is leading to the development of optimized combinatorial
reactivation and immune surveillance strategies designed to purge the latent
viral reservoir.

The strong dependence of retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 
1 (HIV-1), on host cell factors is no more apparent than when the endosomal
sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is purposely disengaged.
The resulting potent inhibition of retrovirus release underscores the importance 
of understanding fundamental structure-function relationships at the ESCRT-HIV-1 
interface. Recent studies utilizing advanced imaging technologies have helped
clarify these relationships, overcoming hurdles to provide a range of potential
models for ESCRT-mediated virus abscission. Here, we discuss these models in the 
context of prior work detailing ESCRT machinery and the HIV-1 release process. To
provide a template for further refinement, we propose a new working model for
ESCRT-mediated HIV-1 release that reconciles disparate and seemingly conflicting 
studies.

The uneven anatomic distribution of cell subsets that harbor human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during antiretroviral therapy (ART) complicates
investigation of the barriers to HIV cure. Here we propose that while previous
studies done largely in blood cells have led to important investigations into HIV
latency, other important mechanisms of HIV persistence during ART may not be
readily apparent in the bloodstream. We specifically consider as an example the
question of ongoing HIV replication during ART. We discuss how growing
understanding of key anatomic sanctuaries for the virus can inform future
experiments aimed at further clarifying this issue.

One of the major barriers to the successful design and implementation of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) curative strategies is the limited ability to
sensitively, specifically, and precisely quantify and characterize the whole-body
burden of replication-competent HIV in individuals on effective antiretroviral
therapy. Here, we review the development and validation of assays that directly
and indirectly measure the size and distribution of the reservoir in blood and
tissues. We also discuss the role that treatment interruptions will have in
validating these assays and ultimately as a "proof of cure."

Current HIV therapy is not curative regardless of how soon after infection it is 
initiated or how long it is administered, and therapy interruption almost
invariably results in robust viral rebound. Human immunodeficiency virus
persistence is therefore the major obstacle to a cure for AIDS. The testing and
implementation of novel yet unproven approaches to HIV eradication that could
compromise the health status of HIV-infected individuals might not be ethically
warranted. Therefore, adequate in vitro and in vivo evidence of efficacy is
needed to facilitate the clinical implementation of promising strategies for an
HIV cure. Animal models of HIV infection have a strong and well-documented
history of bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and eventual clinical 
implementation. More recently, animal models have been developed and implemented 
for the in vivo evaluation of novel HIV cure strategies. In this article, we
review the recent progress in this rapidly moving area of research, focusing on
the two most promising model systems: humanized mice and nonhuman primates.

The latent HIV-1 reservoir in blood decays very slowly, even during prolonged
suppression of viral replication by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mechanisms for 
reservoir persistence include replenishment through low-level viral replication, 
longevity and homeostatic proliferation of memory T cells, and most recently
appreciated, clonal expansion of HIV-infected cells. Clonally expanded cells make
up a large and increasing fraction of the residual infected cell population on
ART, and insertion of HIV proviruses into certain host cellular genes has been
associated with this proliferation. That the vast majority of proviruses are
defective clouds our assessment of the degree to which clonally expanded cells
harbor infectious viruses, and thus the extent to which they contribute to
reservoirs relevant to curing infection. This review summarizes past studies that
have defined our current understanding and the gaps in our knowledge of the
mechanisms by which proviral integration and clonal expansion sustain the HIV
reservoir.

Quiescent proviral genomes that persist during human immunodeficiency virus type 
1 (HIV-1) infection despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) can fuel
rebound viremia after ART interruption and is a central obstacle to the cure of
HIV infection. The induction of quiescent provirus is the goal of a new class of 
potential therapeutics, latency reversing agents (LRAs). The discovery,
development, and testing of HIV LRAs is a key part of current efforts to develop 
latency reversal and viral clearance strategies to eradicate established HIV
infection. The development of LRAs is burdened by many uncertainties that make
drug discovery difficult. The biology of HIV latency is complex and incompletely 
understood. Potential targets for LRAs are host factors, and the potential
toxicities of host-directed therapies in individuals that are otherwise
clinically stable may be unacceptable. Assays to measure latency reversal and
assess the effectiveness of potential therapeutics are complex and incompletely
validated. Despite these obstacles, novel LRAs are under development and
beginning to enter combination testing with viral clearance strategies. It is
hoped that the steady advances in the development of LRAs now being paired with
emerging immunotherapeutics to clear persistently infected cells will soon allow 
measurable clinical advances toward an HIV cure.

BACKGROUND: The host range of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is quite narrow.
Therefore, analyzing HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo has been limited owing to lack of
appropriate animal model systems. To overcome this, chimeric simian and human
immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) that encode HIV-1 Env and are infectious to
macaques have been developed and used to investigate the pathogenicity of HIV-1
in vivo. So far, we have many SHIV strains that show different pathogenesis in
macaque experiments. However, dynamic aspects of SHIV infection have not been
well understood. To fully understand the dynamic properties of SHIVs, we focused 
on two representative strains-the highly pathogenic SHIV, SHIV-KS661, and the
less pathogenic SHIV, SHIV-#64-and measured the time-course of experimental data 
in cell culture.
METHODS: We infected HSC-F with SHIV-KS661 and -#64 and measured the
concentration of Nef-negative (target) and Nef-positive (infected) HSC-F cells,
the total viral load, and the infectious viral load daily for 9 days. The
experiments were repeated at two different multiplicities of infection, and a
previously developed mathematical model incorporating the infectious and
non-infectious viruses was fitted to the full dataset of each strain
simultaneously to characterize the infection dynamics of these two strains.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We quantified virological indices including virus burst 
sizes and basic reproduction number of both SHIV-KS661 and -#64. Comparing the
burst size of total and infectious viruses (viral RNA copies and TCID50,
respectively), we found that there was a statistically significant difference
between the infectious virus burst size of SHIV-KS661 and -#64, while there was
no significant difference between the total virus burst size. Furthermore, our
analyses showed that the fraction of infectious virus among the produced
SHIV-KS661 viruses, which is defined as the infectious viral load (TCID50/ml)
divided by the total viral load (RNA copies/ml), is more than 10-fold higher than
that of SHIV-#64 during overall infection (i.e., for 9 days). Taken together, we 
conclude that the highly pathogenic SHIV produces infectious virions more
effectively than the less pathogenic SHIV in cell culture.

Occupational health management plays an important role in the prevention of
provider-to-patient transmission in healthcare workers infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or hepatitis C virus
(HCV). Therefore, the Japan Society for Occupational Health's Research Group on
Occupational Health for Health Care Workers has proposed a consensus for the
management of healthcare workers infected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV based on
recent evidence for each concerned group. The consensus recommends that: (1)
employers in medical institutions should establish a policy of respecting the
human rights of healthcare workers, management strategies for occupational blood 
exposure, and occupational health consultation; (2) occupational health staff
should appropriately assess the risk of provider-to-patient transmission of HIV, 
HBV, and/or HCV infection and rearrange their tasks if necessary. When conducting
risk assessment, occupational health staff should obtain informed consent and
then cooperate with the physician in charge as well as infection control experts 
in the workplace; (3) healthcare workers infected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV
should disclose their employment to their treating physician and consult with
their doctor regarding the need for special considerations at work; and (4)
supervisors and colleagues in medical institutions should correctly understand
the risks of HIV, HBV, and HCV infection and should not engage in any behavior
that leads to discrimination against colleagues infected with HIV, HBV, and/or
HCV.

Macrophages are one of the major targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1),
but the viral entry pathway remains poorly understood in these cells. Noninvasive
virus labeling and single-virus tracking are effective tools for studying virus
entry. Here, we constructed a quantum dot (QD)-encapsulated infectious HIV-1
particle to track viral entry at a single-particle level in live human primary
macrophages. QDs were encapsulated in HIV-1 virions by incorporating viral
accessory protein Vpr-conjugated QDs during virus assembly. With the HIV-1
particles encapsulating QDs, we monitored the early phase of viral infection in
real time and observed that, during infection, HIV-1 was endocytosed in a
clathrin-mediated manner; the particles were translocated into Rab5A-positive
endosomes, and the core was released into the cytoplasm by viral
envelope-mediated endosomal fusion. Drug inhibition assays verified that endosome
fusion contributes to HIV-1 productive infection in primary macrophages.
Additionally, we observed that a dynamic actin cytoskeleton is critical for HIV-1
entry and intracellular migration in primary macrophages. HIV-1 dynamics and
infection could be blocked by multiple different actin inhibitors. Our study
revealed a productive entry pathway in macrophages that requires both endosomal
function and actin dynamics, which may assist in the development of inhibitors to
block the HIV entry in macrophages.

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus 2 infection is endemic in West Africa
but is also found in parts of Europe, North and South America, and India where it
is thought to have been introduced secondary to migration and commercial trade
ties. It is less common than Human immunodeficiency virus 1, with differences in 
pathogenicity, lower rates of transmission, longer asymptomatic period and slower
progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Human immunodeficiency virus 2
is also associated with diagnostic challenges given the lack of commercially
available diagnostic tests, and management challenges given intrinsic resistance 
to many anti-retroviral therapies.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 65 year old South Indian female,
visiting her family in Australia, who presented with weight loss, pancytopaenia
and generalised lymphadenopathy on a background of newly diagnosed congestive
cardiac failure. Multiple investigations were performed to elucidate the cause of
her presentation, with the eventual unexpected diagnosis of human
immunodeficiency virus 2. She was commenced on anti-retroviral treatment and made
a remarkable recovery.
CONCLUSION: We describe the challenges associated with diagnosis of human
immunodeficiency virus 2 due to lack of commercially available diagnostics, as
well as the treatment and management challenges including the fact that human
immunodeficiency virus 2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Human immunodeficiency virus 2 infection should be
considered in patients who present with symptoms and signs that do not point
towards a clear diagnosis, such as unexplained pancytopaenia or lymphadenopathy, 
and who have risk factors such as being from an endemic area or having had blood 
transfusions, especially prior to the commencement of blood-borne virus screening
of blood donors.

The advent of antiretroviral therapy has transformed infection by the type 1
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a rapidly fatal disease to a chronic
illness with excellent long-term survival rates. Although HIV primarily targets
the adaptive arm of host immunity, it simultaneously impacts the innate immune
system, and has profound implications for lung health, even when viral
suppression is achieved with antiretroviral therapy. The lung has evolved a
unique array of innate immune defenses, and the pathophysiological interactions
between HIV and the pulmonary innate immune system deserve particular attention. 
In this review, we discuss work that elucidates how the components of innate
immunity both respond to and are perturbed by infection with HIV.

Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection models in cynomolgus macaques are
important for analysis of the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency virus and for
studies on the efficacy of new vaccine candidates. However, very little is known 
about the pathogenesis of SIV or simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in
cynomolgus macaques from different Asian countries. In the present study, we
analysed the infectivity and pathogenicity of CCR5-tropic SIVmac and those of
dual-tropic SHIV89.6P inoculated into cynomolgus macaques in Indonesian,
Malaysian or Philippine origin. The plasma viral loads in macaques infected with 
either SIVmac239 or SHIV89.6P were maintained at high levels. CD4+ T cell levels 
in macaques infected with SIVmac239 gradually decreased. All of the macaques
infected with SHIV89.6P showed greatly reduced CD4+ T-cell numbers within 6 weeks
of infection. Eight of the 11 macaques infected with SIVmac239 were killed due to
AIDS symptoms after 2-4.5 years, while four of the five macaques infected with
SHIV89.6P were killed due to AIDS symptoms after 1-3.5 years. We also analysed
cynomolgus macaques infected intrarectally with repeated low, medium or high
doses of SIVmac239, SIVmac251 or SHIV89.6P. Infection was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR at more than 5000, 300 and 500 TCID50 for SIVmac239,
SIVmac251 and SHIV89.6P, respectively. The present study indicates that
cynomolgus macaques of Asian origin are highly susceptible to SIVmac and SHIV
infection by both intravenous and mucosal routes. These models will be useful for
studies on virus pathogenesis, vaccination and therapeutics against human
immunodeficiency virus/AIDS.

Over the last 2 decades human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a
chronic disease requiring long-term management. Aging, antiretroviral therapy,
chronic inflammation, and several other factors contribute to the increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease in patients infected with HIV. In low-income and
middle-income countries where antiretroviral therapy access is limited, cardiac
disease is most commonly related to opportunistic infections and end-stage
manifestations of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, including
HIV-associated cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cardiovascular screening, prevention, and risk factor management are important
factors in the management of patients infected with HIV worldwide.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Impairs IFN-Alpha Production Induced by TLR-7
Agonist in Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an important role in innate immune
response against viruses, mainly through interferon-α (IFN-α) secretion. Impaired
IFN-α secretion has been observed in patients with acute human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the reasons for this impairment are still
obscure. To know the grounds behind this situation, HIV-1 viral copy numbers
similar to those found in primary HIV-1 infection were used to stimulate
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pDCs in this study. Intracellular 
IFN-α production was seen as early as 2 h in pDCs with TLR-7 agonist (imiquimod) 
stimulation, but HIV-1 required 48 h to induce secretion of IFN-α in supernatants
and it was 10 times less compared to imiquimod. Thus, it shows that HIV-1 delays 
and impairs IFN-α production from pDCs. Furthermore, the IFN-α inhibitory
activity of HIV-1 was checked by stimulating PBMCs and pDCs with imiquimod either
simultaneously with HIV-1 or after 2 h pre-exposure to HIV-1. Pre-exposure to
HIV-1 resulted in significant reduction in IFN-α secretion by pDCs and PBMCs when
compared to imiquimod alone. In addition, simultaneous stimulation of these
populations with HIV-1 and imiquimod resulted in significant impairment in IFN-α 
production in pDCs but not in PBMCs. HIV-1 not only fails to induce IFN-α in
adequate quantities but also inhibits IFN-α secretary capacity of pDCs. HIV-1
particles were found to bind CD303 receptor on pDC surface probably blocking
initiation of cascade leading to IFN-α impairment. The understanding of the
pathways that lead to this suppression may help in devising the HIV control
strategies.

Lentiviruses have evolved the Vif protein to counteract APOBEC3 (A3) restriction 
factors by targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Previous studies have
identified important residues in the interface of human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) Vif and human APOBEC3C (hA3C) or human APOBEC3F (hA3F). However,
the interaction between primate A3C proteins and HIV-1 Vif or natural HIV-1 Vif
variants is still poorly understood. Here, we report that HIV-1 Vif is inactive
against A3Cs of rhesus macaques (rhA3C), sooty mangabey monkeys (smmA3C), and
African green monkeys (agmA3C), while HIV-2, African green monkey simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm), and SIVmac Vif proteins efficiently mediate the 
depletion of all tested A3Cs. We identified that residues N/H130 and Q133 in
rhA3C and smmA3C are determinants for this HIV-1 Vif-triggered counteraction. We 
also found that the HIV-1 Vif interaction sites in helix 4 of hA3C and hA3F
differ. Vif alleles from diverse HIV-1 subtypes were tested for degradation
activities related to hA3C. The subtype F-1 Vif was identified to be inactive for
degradation of hA3C and hA3F. The residues that determined F-1 Vif inactivity in 
the degradation of A3C/A3F were located in the C-terminal region (K167 and D182).
Structural analysis of F-1 Vif revealed that impairing the internal salt bridge
of E171-K167 restored reduction capacities to A3C/A3F. Furthermore, we found that
D101 could also form an internal interaction with K167. Replacing D101 with
glycine and R167 with lysine in NL4-3 Vif impaired its counteractivity to A3F and
A3C. This finding indicates that internal interactions outside the A3 binding
region in HIV-1 Vif influence the capacity to induce degradation of
A3C/A3F.IMPORTANCE: The APOBEC3 restriction factors can serve as potential
barriers to lentiviral cross-species transmissions. Vif proteins from
lentiviruses counteract APOBEC3 by proteasomal degradation. In this study, we
found that monkey-derived A3C, rhA3C and smmA3C, were resistant to HIV-1 Vif.
This was determined by A3C residues N/H130 and Q133. However, HIV-2, SIVagm, and 
SIVmac Vif proteins were found to be able to mediate the depletion of all tested 
primate A3C proteins. In addition, we identified a natural HIV-1 Vif (F-1 Vif)
that was inactive in the degradation of hA3C/hA3F. Here, we provide for the first
time a model that explains how an internal salt bridge of E171-K167-D101
influences Vif-mediated degradation of hA3C/hA3F. This finding provides a novel
way to develop HIV-1 inhibitors by targeting the internal interactions of the Vif
protein.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a global pandemic and
there is an urgent need for innovative treatment. Immune cells represent a major 
target of virus infection, but are also therapeutic targets. Currently, no
antiretroviral therapy targets macrophages, which function as portal of entry and
as major long-term deposit of HIV. It has been shown before that human
macrophages efficiently internalize gold nanoparticles, a fact which might be
used to target them with drug-nanoparticle conjugates. Here, the authors use gold
nanocarriers to facilitate delivery of stavudine, a widely used antiretroviral
drug, to primary human macrophages. Using an ease-of-use coupling method, a
striking potentiation of stavudine intake by macrophages using gold nanocarriers 
is shown. Further, the carriers induce a specific subtype of proinflammatory
activation indicative for antiviral activity of macrophages, which suggests
promising novel treatment options for HIV.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of co-infection with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the genetic
characteristics of both viruses among pre-HIV-treatment patients in Harare,
Zimbabwe. This cross-sectional survey involved 176 remnant plasma samples
collected from consenting HIV patients (median age 35 [18-74]) between June and
September 2014. HBV seromarkers were determined by high-sensitivity
chemiluminescence assays. Molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted on the
basal core promoter/precore (BCP/PC) and S regions of HBV, as well as part of the
HIV pol region. Of the 176 participants (65.7% female), 19 (10.8%) were positive 
for HBsAg (median 0.033 IU/ml (IQR 0.01-415). The HBsAg incidence was higher in
men than women (P = 0.009). HBsAg-positive subjects had lower median CD4 counts
(P = 0.016). HBV DNA was detectable in 12 HBsAg-positive samples (median 3.36 log
cp/ml (2.86-4.51), seven being amplified and sequenced. All isolates were
subgenotype A1 without HBV drug resistance mutations but each had at least one
BCP/PC mutation. PreS deletion mutants and small S antigen variants M133I/T and
D144G were identified. Of the 164 HIV isolates successfully genotyped, 163
(99.4%) were HIV-1 subtype C and only one was HIV-1 subtype F1. Sixteen (9.8%)
had at least one drug resistance mutation, predominantly non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor-related mutations, observed mostly among female
participants. This study shows that co-infection with HBV is present among HIV
patients enrolling into HIV care in Zimbabwe, suggesting that HBV screening and
monitoring programmes be strengthened in this context. J. Med. Virol. 89:257-266,

In the last three decades, extensive research on human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) has highlighted its capability to exploit a variety of strategies to enter 
and infect immune cells. Although CD4(+) T cells are well known as the major HIV 
target, with infection occurring through the canonical combination of the cluster
of differentiation 4 (CD4) receptor and either the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 
(CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) coreceptors, HIV has also been 
found to enter other important immune cell types such as macrophages, dendritic
cells, Langerhans cells, B cells, and granulocytes. Interestingly, the expression
of distinct cellular cofactors partially regulates the rate in which HIV infects 
each distinct cell type. Furthermore, HIV can benefit from the acquisition of new
proteins incorporated into its envelope during budding events. While several
publications have investigated details of how HIV manipulates particular cell
types or subtypes, an up-to-date comprehensive review on HIV tropism for
different immune cells is lacking. Therefore, this review is meant to focus on
the different receptors, coreceptors, and cofactors that HIV exploits to enter
particular immune cells. Additionally, prophylactic approaches that have targeted
particular molecules associated with HIV entry and infection of different immune 
cells will be discussed. Unveiling the underlying cellular receptors and
cofactors that lead to HIV preference for specific immune cell populations is
crucial in identifying novel preventative/therapeutic targets for comprehensive
strategies to eliminate viral infection.

Improved survival with combination antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic
increase in the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals
50 years of age or older such that by 2020 more than 50% of HIV-infected persons 
in the United States will be above this age. Recent studies confirm that
antiretroviral therapy should be offered to all HIV-infected patients regardless 
of age, symptoms, CD4+ cell count, or HIV viral load. However, when compared with
HIV-uninfected populations, even with suppression of measurable HIV replication, 
older individuals are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, malignancies,
liver disease, and other comorbidities.

A cross sectional survey was performed to investigate the epidemic of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis, and HIV-1
subtype infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) and to evaluate factors 
that were correlated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 657 MSM in
Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, during 2012-2013. Data on socio-demographic parameters and
risky behaviors were collected, and blood samples were obtained. In this survey, 
the prevalence of STIs due to HIV (5.3%), HCV (0.6%), and syphilis (19.2%) were
measured. Of 35 HIV-infected MSM, 1 (0.2%) and 17 (2.6%) were co-infected with
HCV and syphilis. Among 33 samples with available HIV-1 genomic fragment
sequences, 6.1% B, 72.7% CRF01_AE, and 21.2% CRF07_BC were identified.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age > 30 years (odds ratio 
[OR] 2.002; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.144-3.502) and having had STI
symptoms in the past year (OR, 11.673; 95% CI, 3.092-44.078) were positively
correlated with having an STI, while consistent use of a condom when having sex
with male partners (OR, 0.621; 95% CI, 0.408-0.945) was significantly associated 
with a low STI rate. The worsening epidemic of HIV, HCV, and syphilis infections,
and the prevalence of complex subtypes of HIV-1 and other risk factors suggest
that effective intervention strategies should be strengthened for MSM in
Zhenjiang, Jiangsu.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1
(HTLV-1) are complex retroviruses mainly infecting CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In
addition, antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) are targeted in 
vivo by both viruses, although to a lesser extent. Interaction of HIV-1 with DCs 
plays a key role in viral dissemination from the mucosa to CD4(+) T lymphocytes
present in lymphoid organs. While similar mechanisms may occur for HTLV-1 as
well, most HTLV-1 data were obtained from T-cell studies, and little is known
regarding the trafficking of this virus in DCs. We first compared the efficiency 
of cell-free versus cell-associated viral sources of both retroviruses at
infecting DCs. We showed that both HIV-1 and HTLV-1 cell-free particles are
poorly efficient at productively infecting DCs, except when DC-SIGN has been
engaged. Furthermore, while SAMHD-1 accounts for restriction of cell-free HIV-1
infection, it is not involved in HTLV-1 restriction. In addition, cell-free
viruses lead mainly to a nonproductive DC infection, leading to trans-infection
of T-cells, a process important for HIV-1 spread but not for that of HTLV-1.
Finally, we show that T-DC cell-to-cell transfer implies viral trafficking in
vesicles that may both increase productive infection of DCs ("cis-infection") and
allow viral escape from immune surveillance. Altogether, these observations
allowed us to draw a model of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 trafficking in DCs.

Zoonotic transmission of simian retroviruses in West-Central Africa occurring in 
primate hunters has resulted in pandemic spread of human immunodeficiency viruses
(HIVs) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). While simian foamy virus (SFV)
and simian T- lymphotropic virus (STLV)-like infection were reported in healthy
persons exposed to nonhuman primates (NHPs) in West-Central Africa, less is known
about the distribution of these viruses in Western Africa and in hospitalized
populations. We serologically screened for SFV and STLV infection using 1,529
specimens collected between 1985 and 1997 from Côte d'Ivoire patients with high
HIV prevalence. PCR amplification and analysis of SFV, STLV, and HIV/SIV
sequences from PBMCs was used to investigate possible simian origin of infection.
We confirmed SFV antibodies in three persons (0.2%), two of whom were
HIV-1-infected. SFV polymerase (pol) and LTR sequences were detected in PBMC DNA 
available for one HIV-infected person. Phylogenetic comparisons with new SFV
sequences from African guenons showed infection likely originated from a
Chlorocebus sabaeus monkey endemic to Côte d'Ivoire. 4.6% of persons were HTLV
seropositive and PCR testing of PBMCs from 15 HTLV seroreactive persons
identified nine with HTLV-1 and one with HTLV-2 LTR sequences. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that two persons had STLV-1-like infections, seven were HTLV-1,
and one was an HTLV-2 infection. 310/858 (53%), 8/858 (0.93%), and 18/858 (2.1%) 
were HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-positive but undifferentiated by serology,
respectively. No SIV sequences were found in persons with HIV-2 antibodies (n =
1) or with undifferentiated HIV results (n = 7). We document SFV, STLV-1-like,
and dual SFV/HIV infection in Côte d'Ivoire expanding the geographic range for
zoonotic simian retrovirus transmission to West Africa. These findings highlight 
the need to define the public health consequences of these infections. Studying
dual HIV-1/SFV infections in immunocompromised populations may provide a new
opportunity to better understand SFV pathogenicity and transmissibility in
humans.

The cells that are targeted by primate lentiviruses (HIV and simian
immunodeficiency virus [SIV]) are of intense interest given the renewed effort to
identify potential cures for HIV. These viruses have been reported to infect
multiple cell lineages of hematopoietic origin, including all phenotypic and
functional CD4 T cell subsets. The two most commonly reported cell types that
become infected in vivo are memory CD4 T cells and tissue-resident macrophages.
Though viral infection of CD4 T cells is routinely detected in both HIV-infected 
humans and SIV-infected Asian macaques, significant viral infection of
macrophages is only routinely observed in animal models wherein CD4 T cells are
almost entirely depleted. Here we review the roles of macrophages in lentiviral
disease progression, the evidence that macrophages support viral replication in
vivo, the animal models where macrophage-mediated replication of SIV is thought
to occur, how the virus can interact with macrophages in vivo, pathologies
thought to be attributed to viral replication within macrophages, how viral
replication in macrophages might contribute to the asymptomatic phase of HIV/SIV 
infection, and whether macrophages represent a long-lived reservoir for the
virus.

All retroviruses package cellular RNAs into virions. Studies of murine leukemia
virus (MLV) revealed that the major host cell RNAs encapsidated by this simple
retrovirus were LTR retrotransposons and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Several classes
of ncRNAs appeared to be packaged by MLV shortly after synthesis, as precursors
to tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs were all enriched in
virions. To determine the extent to which the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV-1) packages similar RNAs, we used high-throughput sequencing to characterize
the RNAs within infectious HIV-1 virions produced in CEM-SS T lymphoblastoid
cells. We report that the most abundant cellular RNAs in HIV-1 virions are 7SL
RNA and transcripts from numerous divergent and truncated members of the long
interspersed element (LINE) and short interspersed element (SINE) families of
retrotransposons. We also detected precursors to several tRNAs and small nuclear 
RNAs as well as transcripts derived from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic
spacers. We show that packaging of a pre-tRNA requires the nuclear export
receptor Exportin 5, indicating that HIV-1 recruits at least some newly made
ncRNAs in the cytoplasm. Together, our work identifies the set of RNAs packaged
by HIV-1 and reveals that early steps in HIV-1 assembly intersect with host cell 
ncRNA biogenesis pathways.

The recent development of fluorescence microscopy approaches overcoming the
diffraction limit of light microscopy opened possibilities for studying
small-scale cellular processes. The spatial resolution achieved by these novel
techniques, together with the possibility to perform live-cell and multicolor
imaging, make them ideally suited for visualization of native viruses and
subviral structures within the complex environment of a host cell or organ, thus 
providing fundamentally new possibilities for investigating virus-cell
interactions. Here, we review the use of super-resolution microscopy approaches
to study virus-cell interactions, and discuss recent insights into human
immunodeficiency virus biology obtained by exploiting these novel techniques.

A concern during the early AIDS epidemic was the lack of a test to identify
individuals who carried the virus. The first HIV antibody test, developed in
1985, was designed to screen blood products, not to diagnose AIDS. The
first-generation assays detected IgG antibody and became positive 6 to 12 weeks
postinfection. False-positive results occurred; thus, a two-test algorithm was
developed using a Western blot or immunofluorescence test as a confirmatory
procedure. The second-generation HIV test added recombinant antigens, and the
third-generation HIV tests included IgM detection, reducing the test-negative
window to approximately 3 weeks postinfection. Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV
assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the
test-negative window to 11 to 14 days. A new algorithm addressed the
fourth-generation assay's ability to detect both antibody and antigen and yet not
differentiate between them. The fifth-generation HIV assay provides separate
antigen and antibody results and will require yet another algorithm. HIV
infection may now be detected approximately 2 weeks postexposure, with a reduced 
number of false-positive results.

Human immunodeficiency virus has been affecting the human population for more
than 30 years. During this time period, more effective, safe, simple, and
tolerable pharmacologic agents have been developed. To date, there are 26
antiretroviral agents available that are used either as a single agent or a
coformulation in an antiretroviral regimen. The goal of these medications is to
achieve viral suppression in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency
virus. Evidence continues to support the most effective combinations. It is
important that clinicians are knowledgeable of updates so as to provide the best 
possible medical regimen for this population.
